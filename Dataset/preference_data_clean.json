Moreover, with global warming, our world could encounter a huge challenge during the next century. For instance, climate change and global warming are more important for their education rather than science of nutrition, because they need to be prepared to these big change.\nIn my point of view, it is important to teach nutrition to our children, because that could lead at an improvement of their health and lifestyle.

    "essay": "I think students should study about food in schools more frequently. Some people think there is not so much to learn about food, but I think that is wrong. There are lots of different way of preparing food, and it takes lots of time to master them. Also, science behind food is very complex, but it is significant in our life. I will demonstrate my opinion in detail in this essay.\nFirst of all, food is a critical part of a life. In many culture, having and preparing food is considered one of the most important activities to live a enjoyable life. By having a delicious food, one can feel happiness uncomparable to anything. Moreover, preparing food for someone like family or lover is a tremendously rewarding activity. By preparing food for them, you can show how much you care about them, and share your emotions with them. To enjoy this amazing part of life, it is very important to learn how to prepare food and what makes delicious food.\nSecondly, It is crucial to know about how the food effect their health. Some people say 'A human body is a sum of what they have eaten in their life', because The food they ate become a part of their body in the end. We get most of nutritions we need from food. Thus, how we eat massively affect our health. It is scientifically proven that the food culture of a country significantly effect the health status of the people. Therfore, knowing about how the nutritions in food affect our body is very important to leave a healthy life.\nFor this reason, it is crucial to teach about food to students in schools. Food can be a means of communication sometimes, and it can be a precious present that is given to a life. Moreover, food is a source of energy that sustain us, and sometimes it is a medicine that cure our body. Hence, students should study about how to prepare a good food, and understand how it can affect us by its nutritions.",

    "essay": "Some people believe that the science of food and how to make meals should be introduced in schools while others argue that schools should offer only important subjects. I believe that the science of food and how to prepare it should be part of the school subjects as it can bring several benefits in studentÃ¢ÂÂs lives. Thus, this essay discusses how creating an understanding of good nutrition, health and well-being itÃ¢ÂÂs important for students to support positive learning and development.\nModern society with the advertisement of fast food and new products rich in sugar is addressing children and teenagers to choose junk food over healthy. Thus, it is important for schools to introduce the science of food into their curriculum. This subject can positively influence the studentsÃ¢ÂÂ choices about nutrition creating knowledge about food categories, compositions and nutritional values. For example, promoting a healthy and balanced diet can support the students to establish the mindset of acknowledging what they are introducing in their bodies and consequently finding specific foods that might positively impact their well-being.\nContrarily, thereÃ¢ÂÂs the belief that such a subject will reduce the time available for more didactical learning like math, geography or literacy. It might be true as not everyone could be interested in learning about food. However, if observing in detail the science of food, it is evident that it involves a series of challenging topics such as chemistry, biology, food engineering and microbiology.\nTo sum up, while some people think that introducing the science of food could be detrimental to studentsÃ¢ÂÂ learning as it would reduce the time available for more didactical subjects, on the other hand, learning about food and its composition, can be beneficial as it provides with the knowledge that can support healthy eating and wellbeing.",

    "essay": "These days, most students learn many school subjects, not only academic topics like math or language but also non-academic, such as science food and how to prepare it. However, not least have their opinion that students should spend more time on important subjects, particularly academic matters. I believe academic and non-academic subjects should be balanced, and this essay will explain both views.\nHuman brain development makes our kids learn many things in the early phase. Therefore, most elementary students have already learned math or non-native languages, which differs from the past 10 or 20 years ago. Also, they learn subjects unrelated to academics, for instance, science food and how to prepare it. These things are important to them, as they have the knowledge to choose healthy food and prepare it properly, cooked or uncooked. Another reason students should learn about this is that they currently love junk food the most for their daily meals, which is not a good fact for the next generation to have a long life.\nNevertheless, the knowledge of academic subjects should be learned in line with non-academic ones. The main reason is that it will be their foundation for a successful business or career. Without this knowledge, although they have an adequate understanding of the non-academic matter, they will find it hard to compete with other business competitors or candidates in any job recruitment. Eventually, with a long life and a good business or career, they will have a wealthy life ahead and, indeed, their life positively impacts others.\nTo conclude, students with a balanced knowledge of academic and non-academic subjects will have a bright future with a healthy and wealthy life.",

    "essay": "With diet and nutrition becoming more and more popular nowadays, the food industry started to attract a significant number of people to join in, students included. While young people today are encouraged by many to pursue knowledge in related fields, some argue that school time should be invested in other important subjects. Personally, I strongly disagree with the latter.\nThe insignificance of food study is a misconception because of two major reasons. First of all, food is one of our most fundamental needs, but that doesn't make it less important than other fields. In fact, contrary to the common belief, it is actually a subject that still requires much research. For example, we are yet aware of the exact effects of different nutrtients and chemicals on our physiological process. Another problem is the belief that food is not as promising as other science subjects such as biology and physics. However, the statistics said otherwise. In the past decades, profits generated from food industry have been climbing steadily and already overtaken some of the traditional forms.\nPursuing a degree in food science is never a waste of time but its value has become more prominent in recent years. Not only can it help individuals learn more about the mechanism behind food, but it also enables them to lead a heathier life. In addition, as public awareness in health increases, people are paying more attention to what they put in their mouth, so much so that they are willing to pay for a professional to formulate their meal plan, which is a career with great potential for students interested in food research.\nIn conclusion, students should be encouraged to study the science and procedures of preparing food because it is a topic just as important as any other subjects.",

Hence, most schools can afford to provide computers in their classrooms now, and there will always be risks involved with that.

    "essay": "As the technology is improving, more people are seeing to become reliable to the computers\nWhat things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we he more auspicious of their benefits?\nComputers are a relatively new invention. The first computers were built fifty years ago and it is only in the last thirty or so years that their influence has affected our everyday life. Personal computers were introduced as recently as the early eighties. In this short time they have made a tremendous impact on our lives. We are now so dependent on computers that it is hard to imagine what things would be like today without them. You have only got to go into a bank when their main computer is broken to appreciate the chaos that would occur if computers were suddenly removed world-wide.\nIn the future computers will be used to create bigger and even more sophisticated computers. The prospects for this are quite alarming. They will be so complex that no individual could hope to understand how they work. They will bring a lot of benefits but they will also increase the potential for unimaginable chaos. They will, for example, be able to fly planes and they will be able to co ordinate the movements of several planes in the vicinity of an airport. Providing all the computers are working correctly nothing can go wrong. If one small program fails disaster.\nThere is a certain inevitability that technology will progress and become increasingly complex. We should, however, ensure that we are still in a position where we are able to control technology. It will be all too easy to suddenly discover that technology is controlling us. By then it might be too late I believe that it is very important to be suspicious of the benefits that computers will bring and to make sure that we never become totally dependent on a completely technological world. As a result, the computers do give people all kind of convience including quickly knowledge and repeatable education. However, the dependence to the computers is really harmmful to both of students and teachers..",

    "essay": "Many people know the negative consequences of smoking. However, hey still continue this behavior. The main reason is that a cigarette has a chemical component which keeps people smoking and a vital solution to reduce smoking in public is to increase the cigarette price.\nWith regard to this issue, Nicotine is one of the chemicals that manufacturers use to produce a cigarette and its effect causes smokers to be addicted to the compound. As a result, even though these people understand the degree of this dangerous product, they are not likely to stop using it. Furthermore, many health organizations have announced research demonstrating that the factor that hugely affects smokers to not be able to resist smoking us not a cigarette, but Nicotine.\nIn order to counteract the situation, perhaps the most effective mitigation is for governments to set the minimum price of a cigarette on markets which is unaffordable for buyers. Consequently, this action possibly decreases the purchasing power of smokers and, subsequently, they tend to discontinue smoking. This is exemplified by the pilot project of Thai government which charge cigarette purchasers ten times higher than the market price in specific areas. After that the authorities conduct public surveys and find that more than 80% of people who used to smoke in the areas quit smoking.\nIn conclusion, people who smoke cannot change this habit due to Nicotine in a cigarette which can be addressed by governmental policy to raise the price of a cigarette with the view to promote citizens to cease smoking and take care of their health instead.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, Smoking is one of the most destructive unhealthy habit for human had faced since the tobacco invented. so some people think that smoking can help them mentelly and phsicaly and is diffcult stop smoking. While the others believe that smoking can distroy the body slowly and cause the early death. In this essay I will discuss both sides and I will draw my personal opinion.\nIn one hand , smokers are luch of awareness alternative of stress reduction. Thus most of the smoker believe that smoking is the best solution to releave the stress that they face in their daily lives. For example, nowadays we see many of employees are smoking during their working hours to beat the stress and headache. So that is why some people think that quit smoking is a negative point that can effect them directly .\nOn the other hand, majority of the smokers must have tried quitting smoking at least once in thier live time. Frankly it is extrmely hard to kick this habit. However, in the 90th some studies shows the facts that all of smokers can get the medical treatment for a while which can leave them to quit smoking forever. This prove clearly that smoking is just a habit.\nIn conclusion, after carefully analyis of the imprtant points, I believe that the government plays a signaficant factor to help the people, furthermore provide for them all options to stop smoking such as stop selling Nicotine which this is the main ingrediants to causes addiction and damage the body and the brain.",

    "essay": "Although the health related issues caused by smoking are well known to society, smoking is still a popular habit amongst people. This essay will discuss the causes of the popularity of smoking and what can we do to reduce the number of smokers.\nOne of the main causes of people starting to smoke is the bad influence of others surrounding them. Most people start smoking at a young age, inspired by their peers or by people older than them already addicted to cigarettes. For example, research shows that nearly all questioned smokers started at a young age and, as they admit it, they started smoking so they can fit-in the surrounding social group. Furthermore, they say that they started smoking because they believed it looked Ã¢ÂÂcoolÃ¢ÂÂ and manly because their elders, like fathers, also did smoke.\nEven though, in the end, everybody is responsible for the bad choices they make, but it is apparent that something has to be done to reduce the hold that smoking has over society. Awareness campaigns and an increase in the cigarettes cost are the two most efficient ways to prevent people from starting smoking. For example, for the past decade in my country, cigarette advertisements on television or in magazines have been replaced with smoking awareness advertisements showing the horrible diseases caused by this habit. Additionally, every year rise in the cost of cigarettes can be observed. As a result, according to research done recently, the overall number of smokers in our country has been reduced by 50%.\nIn conclusion, it can be said that most people start smoking at a young age when they are most vulnerable to develop bad habbits and that is why social awareness campaigns have to be done to prevent the young generation from getting addicted to cigarettes.",

    "essay": "It is very easy to find someone who smokes in today's society. Even though we were taught that smoke is harmful, we see people exhaling this thick fog everyday partly because some people think that it is cool and it can be purchased almost at every store. This essay will discuss deeply about what causes people to smoke and how this issue can be alleviated.\nFirstly, part of the society believes that it is trendy to smoke. In many pop culture, such as songs, movies, and novels portray smoking possitively. A comedy show that I have seen illustrates one of the character that smokes to be more cool, giving this character an untouchable aura, whilst other characters that did not smoke seem tangible and therefore mundane. Furthermore, cigarettes are easily accessable in any store. A recent study proved that over 80% of those eager to smoke for the first time actually started this behavior because they can buy it from their local shops. The trend from pop culture and the convenience in accessing smoke adds up to the reasons why some people continues with this habit.\nI believe that there are solutions that can tackle and reduce smoking, beginning with medias should portray smoking to have consequences that are relatable. A movie I have seen showed the protagonist's constant need for cigarette throughout the show. However, in the end when he finally unites with his crush, he develops a severe disease, mainly from his smoking habits, in which he regretted in the end. This method of portraying people who smoke totally made my younger niece scared of smoking. In addition, government should control the accessibility of cigarettes. Policies that result and fewer stores being able to sell cigarettes and increasing tax pricing of smoke of any kind will definitely make smoking less convenient for many people.\nIn conclusion, although many people knew how harmful smoking is, many people think it is cool to smoke and it is convenient and easy to buy. By making smoking less trendy in society and harder to access, I believe that smoking will be less attractive, hence reducing the number of smokers in society.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, smoking has become very common in many individuals. Although governments have been trying to prevent people from smoking by displaying many warning advertisements on medias, people struggle to stop smoking. There many reasons that explain this, like the addiction of tabasco, the social effect of smoking, and the lack of awareness about the effects from people. However, many ways to reduce smoking on society exist like the promotion of physical activity as well as medical treaments.\nEvidence strongly shows that the habit of smoking is triggered by the addictive side of tabasco. In fact, studies demonstrate that tabasco contain substances that affect areas in the brain which are reponsible of the feeling of pleasure and addiction. Thus, smoking becomes more and more pleasant and addictive. Moreover, smoking is a way of socialization for people. In fact, many individuals enjoy being gathered and discuss while they smoke a cigaret. They find it very relaxing and pleasant, so they do not plan to stop it as it allows them to meet new people for example. Nevertheless, I believe that the lack of awareness from people about the negative effects is a major component that explains why people do not want to stop smoking. Indeed, many surveys show that people do not know that smoking has several negative effetcs. They know about lungs cancer, despite it seems not to afraid them, but tooth and throat issues are less known in the vast majority of smokers.\nHowever, many ways exist in order to encourage people to stop smoking. In my opinion, physical activity and medical treatments are the most effective. In fact, governments have been investing a lot in the promotion of physical activity by the means of advertising campaigns. For instance, in the USA, surveys show that there is an increase of 20% of people doing physical activity in order to overcome their addiction issues related to smoking. Moreover, medical treatments have been improved over the last years so as to help people to cope with their addiction with smoking, and studies show that treatments are becoming more and more effective. For instance, in France, the number of smokers has decreased, and medical treatment is the second reason to explain this phenomenon, behind physical activity.\nTo conclude, even though there are many reasons that explain the addictive behaviours of people to keep smoking, I believe that there are several ways to improve this situation, particularly by the means of physical activity and medical treatments.",

    "essay": "Many people smoke although they know how harmful smoking is. This essay believes that smokers continue to smoke because they are addicted to nicotine they smoke from cigarettes, and government should launch a campaign saying that smoking can make smokers become nasty or unpleasant to help reduce smoking in society.\nMany smokers cannot stop smoking because they are addicted to nicotine in the cigarettes they have smoked. Nicotine makes smokers feel relaxed and calm when they smoke and makes them addicted to smoke when they feel they need to relax themselves. For example, many people smoke when they feel stressed and when they smoke they feel more relaxed and get some new work ideas according to many smoking survey reports.\nIt is difficult for smokers to quit smoking, so it should be government responsibility to help them and make smoking situation in the country better. Government should launch a campaign that makes smoking habit be nasty and unpleasant for non-smokers in the country. If smoking habit is not acceptable in the society, smokers will not want to do so at least in public because they want to be accepted by their friends or people in the society. For example, in Thailand, government launches a smoking campaign saying that smokers smell bad and it makes smokers uncomfortable to smoke because they do not want to be smelly people and unfriended by people.\nIn conclusion, people continue to smoke because of nicotine addiction, and it is important for government to take serious action, such as releasing a changing-mindset campaign, to help society deal with this situation.",

    "essay": "Although it is well known that smoking causes severe damage to our bodies, many people cannot reduce the bad habit. This is a big problem because many people die of lung cancer every year, and social welfare expenditures are expensive. The point is why so many people continue to smoke and how we can let them stop smoking. In this essay, I will provide two reasons and related examples to solve the questions.\nFirst of all, once people are addicted to smoking, they cannot stop smoking without help. In my experience, my father was a heavy smoker. He wanted to quit smoking but could not do that by himself. Thus, he went to a hospital and met a well-experienced counselor. After my father got advice and medicine, he could cut the bad habit. Therefore, a counselor's help is definitely necessary.\nSecondly, cigarettes are still relatively cheap compared to alcohol. For instance, tobacco was very reasonable in Japan, my home country, several decades ago. Thus, so many people had the habit of smoking rather than drinking alcohol. Then the Japanese government raised the tax rate on cigarettes from 20 percent to 50 percent in order to strongly discourage people from smoking. Consequently, the smoking rate dropped dramatically. As Japan's case shows, the rise in the tax rate is quite effective in reducing smoking in a country.\nThere are probably many people who have different opinions and disagree with my way of thinking. However, considering the two specific reasons and related examples indicated above, I personally believe that addiction and low price are the two main factors of smoking and that the remedies for them are a counselor's advice and raise of tax.",

    "essay": "The topic of whether children should not do homework after school or definitely important to do homework plays a key role in the education of children. Although\nthere are many discussions around the world and some merits and demerits exists, I think that do homework is more important for children.\nInitially, some people strongly argue that children should have other activities than homework. They will be able to spare time for exercise so that their body strength and immunity will be stronger. In addition, especially in Japan, some parents become aware of the Japanese educational system regarding English is not well organized. Therefore, some parents are eager to educate private English lessons for children as younger as possible after school.\nOn the other hand, children are struggling to catch up with their teacher's class\neveryday. And they are required to learn several subjects in one day. Of course, children have a great ability to absorb a lot of memories like a sponge, but it must be hard for them to catch up with the school education curriculums because they need to learn several curriculums every weekday. Therefore, doing homework is a top priority for children to review what they learned every day. It is also effective for children by doing homework who are not so good at some subjects, like mathemathic, history, and so on. This is not only a great chance to enhance their good at subjects, and also helpful to overcome their difficult subjects. Otherwise, children will forget immediately and these weak subjects still remain as disliked subjects.\nFinally, studying, including homework is boring. In contrast, it is the most important role for children to learn fundamental subjects as young as possible because some adults who did not do homework often regret they should have done when they were children. In addition, if children accumulate education by getting older, they will envision their dream what kind of occupation they would like to become.\nhomework is necessary for children more than anything.",

    "essay": "Should Homework be given to students. Many said \"yes\" and many said \"no\". Both sides have good and strong reasons, so let's compare them wisely.\nOn the \"homework is bad for studentsÃ¢ÂÂ side, most people argue that most homeworks is time consuming, and forces students to do it instead of spending their free time afterschool. This also keeps the students inside the house instead of letting them be active and explore the surroundings. Some even said doing homework gives tiredness, stress, and boredom, especially on exam seasons. It also slowed down the social skills development of active students. Many people agreed that homeworks and assignments should be given in another time, instead of after school time, so students could have time to rest at home.\nOn the other hand, \"homework is good for students'' side argued that most homeworks is designed to be done in around fifteen to thirty minutes (Or in other cases thirty minutes to an hour), and students still have time to rest and enjoy their life. Also, imagine if students don't have homework, instead of playing outside, they will rather watch televisions or play video games. In fact, doing homework sharpens your skills in what you practice, like mathematics or memorizing skills.\nIf students can manage their time, they won't feel stressed or tired. Because they didn't do it right away, and the homework stacked up, this made them not want to do it anymore. Or because they do their homework and do other things at the same time. They will get easily distracted, but if you do it focusly, everything will be good. Also you will be prepared for the next lesson.\nSo I agreed that homework is good for you, as long as it is optimized and isn't time consuming. If teachers are abusing it, then it will became a good way to torture students.",

    "essay": "Nowadays people's opinion regarding homework for school children is that it should not be given, on the other hand some people are not agreeing. In fact, they believe that homework is a crucial part for the pupil education.\nPersonally speaking, I am convinced that homework are positive tools for scholar to remember and pratice what they have learnt in class, but it should be a small ratio rather than what they are currently asking.\nFrom my personal experience, I learnt that at the school age, children do not comprehend the importance of aknolwedge information in each different courses. As a result of it, pupil only focus on what they like, discarting subjects that are not in their taste and this is when homework plays a fundamental part. It helps scholar to fix in their memories the lesson they attended and from there building more ideas about it. Consequently, following the next courses will be easier for them. Not only does it help them to learn what has been thought, but also it gives them a method of study and habits which will be crucial for university or personal aknwoledgement. It set up the base to thrive on their own in the future.\nHaving said that, it is understandable if some people are against homework. Teachers might be given a heavy homework load to students, which is unfair because the children should also have the time to enjoy their childhood, playing and having fun. On the other hand, saying no to homework in their full is incorrect. If scholar are not having any homework, they will lose opportunity to learn and in the long run it will affect their productivities.\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that the benefits of homework outweigh the drawbacks. Therefore, homework should be given in order to allow student to understand how to flourish indipendently, but simultaneously, the amount of homework load should be re-evaluated.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, schools around the world are exploring new pedagogical methodologies. Traditionally, schools have used homeworks as a pivotal tool to support childrenÃÂ´s education. However, in the past few years, some schools have piloted a homework-free approach. I believe that homework-based schools provide a more nurturing and effective education compared with homework-free schools.\nHaving homework most of the days helps children to develop their discipline. They might be interested in other activities like seeing friends or playing video games. However, children must learn to prioritize their homework over other activities, which promotes discipline. Similarly, if they want to do things different than their homework, children need to plan and adjust their time, thus learning valuable skills such as time-management. Both skills, discipline and time-management, will help children to perform better later in life. Additionally, it is reasonable to think that children who do their homework will be exposed to study topics for a longer period of time, thus deepening their learning experience. Therefore, they will be more knowledgeable in the future. Finally, one can expect that children who do their homework will be used to working for longer periods of time, which will be helpful during their transition to university and the working life.\nOn the other hand, homework-free schools also have advantages. These children will have more time at home to explore their own interests and hobbies. They could learn skills not typically taught at school like photography or singing. Since most children dislike homework, one could also hypothetize that children attending a homework-free school would be happier. Finally, one can expect that these children would be less stresssed.\nTo conclude, homework-based schools have more advantages for children than homework-free schools. Therefore, homeworks are still an important tool to improve the learning experience of children around the world.",

    "essay": "The economic progress ought to be a concern for a goverment. The economy of a country is directly co-releated to its quality of life. Nonetheless, there are other goals, equally important, which are usually unattended. In this essay I will asses whether or not economic progress should be the most important goal of a government.\nFirstly, money has huge importance due to the fact that it provides power. Furthermore, the most powerful countries are those who have more money. However, in the end, the value of a country is not measured by the amount of money it has, but by its education. A rich country is the one composed by educated people and that should be the main focus of a government. In fact, a country made of intelligent and resourceful people will somehow manage to increase its wealth, whereas if made of lazy people it will be doomed to poverty.\nSecondly, everything related to money and consecuently, economic progress, is always linked to greed. Aditionally, a gorverment that suffers from greed makes wrong decisions consistently. For instance, my birth country; Spain. If you dig into the spanish history you will see a huge number of greedy and unethical decisions made in seek of economic progress such as the american conquest.\nAll things considered, economic progess is a vital goal but not the most important one. Goverments should focus on more valuable things like education. Moreover, decisions regarding economy should never guided by greed. From my point of view, governments shoud give economic progress less importance and attend other matters such as education or social aids. If they create a real change with their decisions, economic progress will eventually be achieved.",

Others however argue that other sectors and their progress are of an equal value and thus similar effort should be made across the board. In this essay I will discuss why although focus on the economic progress can be benefical for a country, I believe that similar emphasis should be put into all sectors to greater our civilisation as a whole.\nFirstly, It is an undisbutable fact that by govermental bodies contributing more so to the growth of industries, it provides for a better quality of life. More money being distributed to businesses and industries allows them to grow and expand, not only offering more employment oppurtunities but greater availabilty of services. For example, In Ireland during the 19th century era of the 'Celtic Tiger',the goverment supplied most of it's yearly budget towards economy. This in turn saw that the country saw an overall downfall of both the unemployment rate and in contrast the manufactoring and establishment of more and more bussiness across counties. This thus highlights how by contributing towards economy, it boosts living standards.\nHowever, in order to contribute to a nations development, this can not be achieved by one sectors progress alone. It is believed by many that by putting emphasis into other fields, for instance education, transport and health, we can better a country as a whole. For example, Japan saw an increase in employment rates once the local government began to contribute more of it's spendings towards the expansion of third level instituitions. Having a better academic background encouraged more and more people to actually seek employnment from already established businesses, which they would not have ever dreamed of doing before holding a diploma. This in turn has had a rippling effect across generations as standards of living continues to surge. Additionally, by governements aiding in better health and transport availabilty, we evidentely aid to the better development of a nation. By having a means of travelling to and from work and similarly a means to take greater care of ourselves, we improve the quality of life of the people across that region.\nTo conclude, the economic growth process is one that continues to rise to date. Most governments believe that their key goal is the progress of this area. However, in my opinion, by equally aiding other sectors such as education, transport and health, we can further impact our economies growth and better the quality of lives for generations to come.",

    "essay": "There is an ever-increasing number of bullying activities in numerous schools. Although it is widely believed that the potential cause is seeking social attention, it is unlikely to be true that school bullying is the appropriate method to build personal branding. Nevertheless, I firmly hold the opinion that every stakeholder shall uncover the most suitable solution to prevent those dreadful actions.\nTo begin with, the primary reason for school bullying is to express students' envy or frustration feelings. There is no denying that those students are bullied by their relatives, occasionally associated with the highest grades or prestigious achievements at school. Another essential consideration is the bullies occasionally have a lack of psychological well-being and look forward to damage other students' skills with dreadful aggression. This provides a typical illustration of the achievements that were achieved by my siblings.\nApart from this, some of the proper approaches could lend support to overcome bullying actions. It is often the case that dealing with oppressors is bitterly cumbersome, particularly for those students who are less capable of winning by standing up against bullies. However, I would like to reaffirm that they still have an opportunity to confront it, for instance, by documenting everything or finding someone in authority and explaining them thoroughly in order to take shelter.\nIn light of this evidence, it is crystal clear that school bullying is able to be eradicated with the presented techniques. Additionally, it might be better to leave the school and move into high-qualified schools rather than confront the bullies.",

    "essay": "Nowadays in many educational buildings bullying is became an enormous issue. From my point of view, the causes of this problematic way to act in a community are multiple. It might be due to family issue, bad example from the society, social media and so on. Despite the origine of this behaviour, it should not be tollerate, but punished.\nTo start with, bullying is a fundamental issue in the youngester society that needs to be tackled as soon as possibile in order to guarantee to the pupils a better childhood. One of the reason why a scholar acts in that way could be found in the household environment. If parents are violent with their child, it could potentially lead the student to act aggressively towards his/her fellows in order to release the anger accumulated at home. Another example that can provoke this type of behaviour is in the society idols. Promote bullying in series tv, movies or throught social media can misguide the idea of right and wrong in a pupil's mind.\nHaving said that, possible solutions to avoid children acting as bullys can be addressed. Firstly, in schools schould exist a zero tollerance policy towards this concept. Secondly, It should be put in place some code of conduct to direct scholars to understand which behaviour is accepted. Thirdly, they could be helped with counseling with a psycologist. Least but not last, bullying should be condemned. Educational institute might not erase this issue, but they can tackle it teaching good discipline and penalizing pupils who act badly.\nTo sum up, in order to address the right solutions, that can be different from one child to another, school schould understand the cause of bullying throughout counseling and then help the student out.",

    "essay": "Most children are facing one form of bullying or the other in our schools on daily basis world wide. It is becoming a serious problem and there is a need to solve this. In this essay, we would be considering two causes and possible ways to solve these.\nFirst of all, the rate at which children bullying each other in the school environment is rising. One major cause is that bullying breeds bullying, children who are faced with physical, mental and emotional abuse from homes tend to transfer their fustrations on their peers. They think that is how one is supposed to live, exacting authority to gain superiority on weaker peers in school. Another is children who has low self esteem, such students feels threatened over their classmates they taught to be more intelligent or having better physical appearance than them.\nAlthough, there are several causes of bullying, teachers should be taught how to identify children who are from abusive homes and inform the appropriate authority. These students would taken away from such toxic environment early and they would be sent for some pschological therapy. Meanwhile, education is also a key factor especially for children who have low self esteem. This should be done by forms such as role plays, presentation and drama, where these students are taught how to have self love and accepting what they can not change on their self.\nIn conclusion, children from abusive homes and those who have low self esteem are some of the reasons for bullying. I recommend that early identification of abusive children and education is some of the ways we can solve these problems.",

    "essay": "Taking about bullying its more important every day. I think that now a days our society is experiencing a transformation of values and with these transformation a lot of thes important values are saturating to get forgotten.\nI think that the first solution has to come from the house, with the parents. It's critical that parents are properly informed about these situation and have the correct preparation to Handel it.\nContinuing with the idea of the first step has to come from house, the school were your child is attending they could give a seminary about bulling and the consequences. And inform parents that the school will have zero tolerance in this cases.\nAlso i think that you have to make aware your child about these situation and talk to them. Explain why its not good to bullying someone because there race, color or the way they think. Tell them that a show of maturity is to learn to respect the different thinking of people.\nLike ones president Benito JuÃÂ¡rez said \"The respect to the right of others is the peace\".\nWhen i was at elementary these term wasn't around but it doesn't mean that bulling doesn't exist. In may days it was common that someone was bulling another student but the times it happened these students, stand for them selves so that's were it was over.\nSo also teach your child to learn to defend themselves and to no tolerate these type of behavior. Tache them that they will always can come to talk to you and help them solve these types of situations and also if they are wittnes of these type of behavior, to don't be indifferent and take a posture of defend the other child.\nThese could be by going with a authority ( teacher, principal, etc) or to try to stop it.",

    "essay": "In this contemporary era, some people give time to their hobbies. From my point of view, they are doing this because of the benefits accrued from the importance of practising hobbies. For example, people who give time to their hobbies feel less stress from who do not. Another reason why practising hobbies a day in a week is vital for some people, because they want to change their daily routine of work and stressful life.\nHobbies have positive effects on a person. It is vital for his/her mental and pshycal health\nby keeping their mind refreshed and maintaining balance of their well-being. For instance, doing a hobby like football or other kinetic hobbies has a significant impact on person's stamina. Furthermore, it is a good chance to move his muscle and prevent premature aging in many individuals.\nThe crucial influences of allocating time to hobbies that we can see on society are the importance of them in improving the family life which consquently will enhance the social life and the society. There are a lot of social hobbies like going to the cinema or travelling which a family can take a part in it and that will make an excellent environment between a father and his childreen and his wife as well.\nAs we have seen, allocate time to hobbies has a significant impact on the individual and the society which could help all concerned to emphasis on this feature to develop their abilities and alleviate the side effects of this stressful life.",

    "essay": "Nowadays it seems that few people are willing to dedicate time to hobbies and pastimes. This essay will state some specific examples and analyze the consequences.\nFirst, literature fans are declining sharply. Decades before, people willingly invested considerable time and energy on reading and studying Jean Austin and Charles Dickens. Literature clubs were appealing, constantly filled with true Shakespear lovers, among whom there were real experts. Unfortunately in recent time book stores do not favor the complete works of Dickens any more for it does not make much profit, and many literature clubs have their doors shut due to members have greatly decreased.\nAlso, it is obvious that sports have been losing popularity. For instace, even about 5 years ago, there were much devoted football fans, and almost every football club had a considerable number of faithful fans. People were more than happy to anticipate the match results and purchase match tickets and lotteries. However it is not the case any more. People are reluctant to stay in the stadium watching a 2-hour football match, which is proven by the constant nearly empty statiums.\nThese phenomena will bring several negative effects on both individuals and the society. First, many people will lose the ability of appreciating masterpieces of great authors like those listed above. Moreover, there would be fewer parents who like to buy their children novels of Austin or selective works of Shakespear, and thus among the next generation much more people may find \"Pride and Prejudice\" unfamiliar, and \"Romeo and Juliet\" alien to them.\nPeople losing interest in sports can be a heavy blow to the economy. If fans do not watch the matches, some football clubs would be on the brink of bankcrupt. The government will also lose a great amount of tax derived from sports industry.\nTo sum up, we have to acknowledge that people tend to hate devote much time to hobbies, including literature and football. It will cause negative effects, like losing appreciating abilities, and causing problems to the economy.",

    "essay": "Hobbies are recreational activities that are pursued away from one's school or work. They are meant to be an escape from the mundane and a way of keeping people sane and happy. Unfortunately, they have become almost a luxury in today's fast-paced world.\nSeveral reasons can account for this massive decrease in the pursuit of hobbies. One such reason is the fact that hobbies require time and money which are two very dear resources in today's world. Social sophistication and technological advancements have brought about changes in hobbies. What used to be called hobbies in the past are now considered obsolete and the new ones, including video games and virtual reality require financial commitment in their pursuit. Even if one has the money to pursue such, he or she would have to set aside time in his or her busy schedule to enjoy those hobbies. It is therefore no wonder that most people found to pursue hobbies today are either wealthy youth or comfortable pensioners.\nSecondly, lack of interest may be an important factor why people devote little to no time to hobbies. Most of the educated lot are taught from a tender age only to concentrate on their studies in order to secure a comfortable future for themselves. Such children are discouraged from enjoying anything away from anything extracurricular and therefore grow into hobby-less adults who work all day and do nothing else otherwise. This is seen in a lot of Ghanaian homes where doing anything other than studying after school is deemed a taboo. Consequently, many grow into adults with little humour or mirth.\nMoreover, many people get exhausted with school or work, which have become extremely intensive nowadays, as compared to the more laid back past. After a tiring day, most people like to crawl into their beds to catch a night-long rest only to return to their busy life the next day.\nThis lack of hobby pursuit, though understandable, does the individual and society more harm than good. Many individuals today are being treated for one mental health or another. Hobbies are a good way to relax and destress through leisure and can go a long way to improve mental health. Its absence will only wreak havoc for the society, which will only consist of tired and apathetic individuals who could not care less about each other and their surroundings.\nIn conclusion, it is important, albeit difficult, to pay attention to hobbies in order to improve the health and psyche of the individual and society as a whole. More effort should be geared at encouraging hobbies at school and at the work place.",

    "essay": "Nowadays everyone is suffering from the lack of time. People try to cope with everything and do their best all the time but we do not have superpowers or an ability not to sleep 24 hours. Honestly, I firmly believe that it is closely linked to not having a hobby these days.\nNeedless to say, time spent on the leisure activities plunged compare to the last century. I firmly believe that one of the main reasons is an addiction to the usage of various technologies. The majority of teenagers cannot live a day without their phone. They try to hide from troubles in that unreal world of communication. I understand that a hobby can also be online, for instance, videogaming but, as I know, really few people perceive it that way. Honestly, the problem is not only in the modern decade, adults also often do not have a specific hobby. The reason of that can be only their overworking and willingness to achieve more than they have at the moment. This race to the best never ends and, sadly, affects others too. Children adopt the habits of their parents. It is a green light for young people to behave in the same way, to think only about work and do not spend any time outside.\nOn the other side, obesity, bad mental health and demotivation can be an effect caused by not having a passion for any activity. I have a great example of the topic - it is me. I had played football professionally for 5 years until I decided to quit the training because of a sense of disinterest in what I do with my life. After, although I started to feel worse and worse, I could not do anything else. I spend all day at the computer doing homework now. I firmly think that I am not the only person who cannot handle with feelings such as anxiety or sadness. Maybe it could be better if I had a stronger character but I guess that a large proportion of my peers think that they would never get enough of joy, therefore it is not only my problem.\nTo sum up, it is clearly understandable that internet and Ã¢ÂÂtendency to be depressedÃ¢ÂÂ of present generation are rapidly displacing hobbies from human life. We need to think more about that problem because, in my opinion, we are really close to be as emotional and alive as robots.",

    "essay": "It is undoubtedly the case that the world has become a global village nowadays. Cooperations between different countries exist almost on every occasion. As a result, there are inevitably large amounts of information that are exchanged and shared for various usages. However, access to information has remained to be one of the most debatable issues. Some people believe that information should be shared without restriction, while others insist that the foremost information shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be exchanged for free. In my view, appropriate measures or costs can be taken to protect valuable information from being abused or stolen.\nIt is fairly easy to understand the view of people who are in favor of exchanging information as much as possible. To improve the quality of research or guarantee the success of cooperation, it is usually necessary to share resources and exchange minds with each other. Furthermore, the amount of shared information is often decisive to the time and result, which sometimes might be eagerly expected. For example, it is almost unimaginable that the vaccine of covid 19 was so quickly created without intensive international cooperation, which contains an enormous sum of shared knowledge and experience in the diverse field, from governments to universities. With the benefit of this sharing, the period of the vaccine, which can take more than ten years in the past, was immensely shortened this time and the quality of the vaccine is also prestigious over the world.\nNevertheless, the over-sharing of information could also be harmful and risky. There is every possibility that information of importance and value can be misused and eventually leads to severe problems if the intention of usage canÃ¢ÂÂt be proven as legal and righteous or the risk of information leakage exists through sharing. For example, if classified military information is hacked by terrorists while the governments of two countries are sharing and discussing their military intelligence, it will result in a horrible disaster that treats all the citizens. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to protect the safety of sensitive information from unauthorized access.\nTo sum up, sharing information is certainly helpful and meaningful in improving a wide variety of cooperation. However, it is also urgent to pay attention to the sharing of sensitive information in order to guarantee its safety.",

Is a huge town a problem to one's well being?\nFirstly, its true that it could be a threat to human health. It is no secret that major towns have a many vehicles and industries; these raise the concerns of environmental and noise pollution.A dirty sorrounding can be a source of outbreaks like cholera as it has been seen in the past. Poor drainages in alleys being a breading ground for mosquitoes hence malaria.Noise on the other hand is irritating and uncomfortable. If anything, peace is a luxury in a town centre.\nTraffic as a result of large population in these cities is quite distressing,so are the increased crime rates. Since many people move there in the quest for greener pastures, the number of unemployed, especially youths skyrockets.Muggings, buglary and traffic cause stress to residents . Stress has been said to lower immunity leaving people susceptible to diseases.\nHowever, we cannot undermine the fact that big towns offer a lot of resources in terms of medical, gym and exercise facilities as well as professionals who are equipped with the know- how of health and wellness, and advantage to people who reside there.\nIn my opinion, one's health is almost solely their responsibility.You will decide where to live,what to eat amongst other factors that affect your mind, soul and body. One can beat traffic if they wake up earlier, they can also choose to go to the gym or not. Why do I say that?

    "essay": "In recent years, the advancement of cutting-edge technology has been elevating the quality of life of customers worldwide. However, the issue at hand is, some consumers face difficulties in choosing products from companies because there are surging numbers of advertisements from rival companies. This essay will examine the extent to where customers are impacted by advertisements and suggest viable methods to protect customers.\nTo begin with, I think that customers are significantly influenced by advertisements viewed to the highest extent because their emotional decision-making as buyers are affected. Although some consumers believe that watching a Mcdonald advertisement on tv does not neccesarily encourage them to purchase foods from Mcdonalds, continously watching Mcdonald advetisements in a repetitive manner will subconsciously revert the customer's attention to order foods from Mcdonalds when they are hungry during late nights. In 2016, a study from Harvard University by Professor Oak mentioned that 75% of consumers who view the same imageries of advertising will began implementing it as a part of their lives. As a result, they become obese. Another point worth mentioning is, rival companies will tend to create an illusion of trust towards their products. If a loyal Colgate customer, a toothpaste brand, was convinced by Oral B through advertisements, another toothpaste brand that their product was better, they will potentially choose Oral B and rely on it permanently despite the fact that they have more flaws in their product. Hence, the customers will become emotionally manipulated.\nOn the contrary, there are a number of profound methodology to prevent increasing numbers of advertisements from influencing customers. One of the most notable ones is, the government should limit the number of advertisements published. Although an advertising company may lose attention from customers due to lack of the marketing, many customers will be able to focus on lesser advertisements that wastes significantly less of their time. Therefore, they will be able to enjoy more time watching the movie or series that they love. Moreover, another important solution that the government should investigate advertisement products displayed online. For instance, in some countries, baby milk powder was replaced with dangerous chemicals that resulted in food poisoning in babies. This caused severe trauma to consumers that re mianly family members worldwide. By implementing stricter control towards advertisement products, customers will be able to reap the rewards of the best products and move on with their life. Yales University states that by enhancing the quality of advertising campaigns despite the rivalry betweem companies, customers will be able to protect themselves from manipulation from marketing schemes. Therefore, customers will be safe from misleading products.\nIn conclusion, while I believe that consumers are significantly influenced by advertisements viewed to the highest extent and create an illusion of trust towards their products, there are also viable measures to protect customers such as the government limiting the number of advertisements shown and investigating advertisement products displayed online.",

    "essay": "These days, consumers often suffer from the increase of numbers of advertisements conducted by competing companies. I believe that this fact has certain negative effects on consumers' working performance as well as their private space and time. In order to protect consumers, some proposals related to protecting their information and eliminating the number of advertisements are required.\nThe increasing number of advertisements has a negative effect on the consumers. Firstly, their working perfomance can be reduced. Obivously, when a person is working, he cannot receive a large number of advertisements, process and response them. I know a researcher who receives a lot of advertising emails from certain banks\nand even some scientific journal while he require time to perform many research projects. This makes him feel uncomfortable when working, thereby reducing the research's quality. Secondly, the advertisements can affect on people private space and time. For examle, when they spend time on their family after a hard working day, or even when they are sleeping. This completyly affects on the consumers, in terms of both physical and mental health.\nFor protecting consumers, certain methods need to be proposed. Firstly, it can be implied that the consumers' information is illegal used by many companies. Therefore, an imporvement of security method can allow us to protect consumers. Secondly, eliminating the number of advertisements performed by companies and eliminating the hours for companies send advertisements are required.\nIn conclusion, the increasing numbers of advertisements leads to certain unwanted results for consumers, such as reducing their working performance as well as their private space and time. For protecting consumers, we need to protect their personal information and eliminate the number of advertisements.",

    "essay": "Habits are taking significant part of human's life from the childhood, when parents are teaching to wake up and eat at the right time, and then continues to came with new people or new significant events. Some people are tend to always make changes in their lives, thinking it is a good thing. However, other people think in the opposite way, and prefer to spend their lives with the same everyday routine. The both opinions have a reasonable logic, and I will try to describe these perspectives.\nOn the one hand, avoiding changes make people's lives stable, and secure the comfort zone, which is not an easy thing to achieve. There are many books and training from psychologists and business coaches providing the phylosophy of doing the same things and keeping little traditions to structure the personality, focus on the right things, and have a plan for every day. Undoubtely, it helps to clear the mind, and keep yourself in safe in some ways from the rapidly changing life.\nOn the other hand, history proves that progress in development is caused by changes human activities. Of course, permanent changes in life means the lack of stability, nevertheless does it mean, that there is no progress?\nThe main point of this perspevtive is not to try everything that could effect positively or negatively, but to try to find a new aspects for personal grow, or get out form the comfort zone and chalenge yourself.\nTo sum up, the both opinions have their own benefits and drawbacks, but the strategy of changes in life dirictly depend on the type of people's character. People who have stable life as their prority are likely to avoide changes, and people who want to make the self-image and life better better will always in findings of new habits",

    "essay": "The topic of some people are fond of spending their lives with doing ordinary tasks every day. And others strongly argue that keep changing is more important to catch up with this society. Although some peoples opinion, working the same things feel relieved and stable in their life, I strongly recommend it is necessary to keep changing, and practicing to get along with this fast paced society.\nIt is often stated that some people are willing to work on monotonous tasks, and keep doing the same tasks is commendable, and be taken as the virtue, especially in Japan. For example, there are sophisticated handcrafts and the craftsmen are often valued and praised to some extent. Therefore, some jobs, including traditional crafts are necessary to maintain Japanese great culture.\nOn the other hand, technology has been developing in recent years. Robot and IT technology have drastically improved in a few decades. Surprisingly, some robots started to serve meals to customers' tables in some restaurants in Japan. This means that technology will take the place of many jobs which used to be handled by people. Therefore, people need to upskill in a variety of work for the future.\nFinally, it is unpredictable which industries and jobs are no longer necessary by human work or other industries will appear in the future. The only thing people can do is observe and predict the social environment, and update their own skills. For example, if people perceived IT programming will be more demandable, and working the same tasks in the factory will be taken by a robot, they should start learning IT programming and other demandable skills as soon as possible.\nIn conclusion, people kept updating their own skills from ancient times. Therefore, people are required to change their lifestyles, and jobs to meet the rapid social improvements and changes. As a result, people will get used to this pace and be more creative.",

    "essay": "Some people prefers living in a stable condidtion. They were doing almost the same routine every day, going to the same bookshop or gorceries on weekend and same things to do at work. There are not much changes in their lives. Others like to living in the changing environment. They keep trying new things, go to the different restrauants or meeting new friends. Sometimes they even challenging themselves by moving to other positions at work.\nI agree with both views because these two views are not conflict. One can meeting new friends in the same coffee store or can meeting old friends in different coffee sotres. The change and unchange only represent some parts of their lives. Like the aforementioned example, one can go to the same gorcery shop every weekend but go out with different friends at Saturday night. Or one can go to different cafes but to have the same order of coffee.\nThe change and unchage are exist in each other. The world is changing all the time that no one can walking in the same street twice. This is a philosephy saying. Because as time flows the stree that you stepped on was no longer the same street, the leaves may change or the tree may changeBut if that is the same path you walk to company every day, it is the same street in your plan. That means the street is relatively changed/unchaged. On one can stop the world changing, and what can be unchange is ourself, or our minds. We can have the same mindset everyday in different environments.",

    "essay": "There is no doubt that this approach in life gives those people a stable feeling, when they stay in the same position for a long period they feel comfortable because they will avoid any issues. In this article I am going to demonstrate the reasons behind why people prefer to eliminate any chance to change.\nTo illustrate, I belive that there are too kinds of people, the kind which they prefer to change freqentily to try new things or to improve their life or to develop any shortage things they relies that they have to change. In the other side we have the people which feels more peaceful when they avoid any changes more then when they add any things new to there life. In addition, this group of people have another reasons that explain why they did not attind to change, the reasons about the space which they get from the stability, the new things make them feel more confuse.\nIn conclusion, there are many approaches to live in this planet, in my opinion the people which have more interest to try new things they have the ability to think in critivty way and see the details in any thing they will face also they have the fast dicison skills comparing the other people because they try new things constant and have the confidant etheir. while the conservative people have no flexibility to make fast decision or to think by using new tools, but the advantage for them are they look like have more wise thinking.",

    "essay": "In the past, couples moved together after getting married, there was no other choice. Nowadays, living together before deciding to get married, is a common trend specially by young couples. I strongly agree that sharing a life before heading to the next level of a relationship, is a positive way to get to learn each other better.\nFirst and foremost, by living together the couple will learn some of the bad habit the other one has such as brushing the teeth in the kitchen sink, leave the dishes in the sink for another time to clean them and more. It is important, that the person is aware of such behaviour, so when they get married, it is not a surprise. Additionally, the individual has enough time to deal with it or to make a negative decision. Moreover, they can talk about it and look together for solutions.\nBy living together the individuals share the bills and other invoices. Thus, they will find out if the other one is reliable and able to pay the bills on time. There is enough evidence, that the finances are a challenge in many relationships. You want to make sure that the bills are paid on time. In many relationships, the individuals share a bank account specifically to pay invoices, trust a priority, indeed. For example, you do not want to need to pay for your expenses and the bank account is emptied by your partner.\nOn the other hand, in many conservative cultures and societies, people can only move together after marriage. The individuals do not know whom they will be sharing their lives. Thus, much has to be learnt and accepted due to the fact, that getting divorced is not accepted.\nTo sum up, living together before getting married has a myriad of advantages. Thus, I am of the view, that it is beneficial to live together and get to learn each other well before taking the next step.",

    "essay": "Many people believe it may be advisable for couples to live together before getting married, as it may lead to a smoother relationship after they have married.\nI tend to agree with such opinions, as I find the arguments that usually support them to be quite reasonable. For example, it is commonly said that people act differently when they are at home and when they are outside. People instinctively tend to be more relaxed and off-guard when at home, whereas in social situations they usually make an effort, even if unconsciously, to be more likable and to conceal the less agreeable aspects of their personality from others, even their partners. Because of this, it is usual to hear that one does not truly know someone until one has lived with that person.\nIn extreme cases, cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail and will lead to unhappiness. Considering this possibility seems reasonable, as marriage is not only an emotional bond, but also a legal one, and undoing it is usually upsetting, time-consuming and costly.\nAnother reason I find cohabitation before marriage to be a sensible choice is that, as minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation, it is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can already be stressful, such as the few weeks before the ceremony and the weeks following.\nWhat I have said up to this point reflects my opinion, but it must be noted I did not put any of it into practice when I got married. Indeed, my wife and I decided to move in together only a few weeks before the ceremony. This decision was due to the fact that her family is quite old-fashioned, and moving in together before would undoubtedly have caused them pain, even if we had our reasons for doing so and they would have understood them. No degree of persuasion would have avoided or removed such pain. We found the long-term benefits of a stable and close relationship with her family to be more important than the discomfort of not moving in together, and we ultimately decided to do it only once the ceremony was planned.",

    "essay": "Couples living together before their weddings was once deemed as a disgrace. However, as our society keeps developing, more and more people start to accept the idea of cohabitation and put it into action. Admittedly, cohabitation can be advantageous. However, I do believe that people need to exercise caution when making the decision of living together with a partner.\nIt is true that living together with one's partner is a great opportunity for couples to know their partners as well as life after marriage better. Lovers tend to love each other so much that they can easily miss some tiny but crucial details or habits of their significant other. Cohabitation makes these details and habits unavoidable since two people are basically seeing each other for hours on a daily basis. Cohabitation can also be a buffer to help young couples move into a new stage in their lives. However, despite the fact that people are expected to completely understand their husband or wife-to-be as well as marriage itself, it is not guaranteed that they will still make the decision to marry that person after cohabitation.\nSome people find it difficult or even dangerous to put the idea of cohabitation into implementation. Lovers in a long-distance relationship, for example, usually reside in different cities and can only see each other once in a while. In such situations, cohabitation means that one person must give up his or her career. This seems to be unfair and may lead to unnecessary breakups. Another instance is that some people can use cohabitation to, financially or sexually, take advantage of other people.\nAll in all, many advantages can be attributed to cohabitation, but I still think that people need to be cautious before moving in with a partner.",

    "essay": "Accurately assessing which is the best way of teaching children is not an easy task, but when it comes to comparing between taking lesson at home or at school the issue becomes even more complicated to figure it out. In this essay I am going to explain the two main views people hold on this subject.\nA sizeable number of people argue that children would be best served by being taught at home rather than turning up at school , because of the highly comfortable and utterly familiar environment, which allow them to being involved into attending lessons as well as doing assignments more effectively and reducing distractions. As a result , thanks to the time-saving, the children may have enough time to spent for their leisure and sport activities.\nHowever, many others beg to differ, claiming that a laptop cannot replace human touch without impacts negatively students performances, since the lack of direct relationship in that specific stage of age might be detrimental not only to childrenÃ¢ÂÂs school marks, but for themselves.\nMoreover, those who hold this current of thought contend that being a student-at-home come at the cost of concentration, as such a comforting background may shift children focus toward more appealing activities, standing in stark contrast with the former view aforementioned.\nTo my mind, I believe that COVID experience has provided some insight that could help us to take the stock of the situation in this vein, namely, the flurry of psychological ailments of which the children were suffering during the lockdown were mostly sparked by their isolation toward their peers, it found.\nConsequently, it means that relationship restriction would lead to depression which in turn, affects the mental processes underlying the school performances overall. Hence, it is reasonable to think that children are better off studying at school along with their mates rather than in a more reclusive way such as doing it alone at home.",

Some people prefer their kids to get home-educated, while others believe that it is important for them to go to school. I am a strong advocate that children must go to school for a variety of reasons, wich will be mentioned in this essay.\nTo commence with, eventhough it is important to get a proper education and this can be found in both schools and at home, however, going to school on a daily basis can garantee the kid to communicate with his/her peers. And this can be in a negative or positive way- nowadays, but no matter which way the kid experiences, it is still going to be an experience that the kid will develop and learn from after. And it will assist bulding the child's character, in addition to, other fundemental traits. Like for example, gaining self-esteem, and leading skills, and so on ...\nLikewise, it is children nature to be too energetic- generally speaking- so going to school, and playing with their friends, can be the best way for them to get rid of this energy. For instance, if the kid was running around the house, he propably would get scolded by his parents. Because at home there is no much space like outside. In addition, it is for the child's physical health to be active and go outside, not stay at home all day.\nOverall, I believe that it is a better option for them to go to school instead of getting home-schooled.

    "essay": "People have different views about whether children should be educated at home or at school. Although teaching at home sometimes provided a more comfortable environment, I believe that making children go to school is better for their development.\nOn the one hand, studying at home always provides a comfortable environment for children. When children study at some place they live and stay every day, they tend to be more relaxed, it can encourage children to study in better efficiency. In addition, education plans can be customized if children are going to study at home, and maximize their advantages in talents. Take the case of Lang Lang, who was a famous Chinese musician, he was found talented in piano since he was the age of 5 and started long-term customized piano training at home, eventually becoming the champion of the Chinese national piano competition in his 20s. Furthermore, parents can take care of childrenÃ¢ÂÂs study progression, difficulties, and mental health the first time, and make corresponding adjustments in time.\nOn the other hand, it perhaps better for childrenÃ¢ÂÂs development to let them get used to go to school. Firstly, despite the comfortable, simple environment at home, children could not always stay inside their Ã¢ÂÂgreen houseÃ¢ÂÂ once they grew up, they need to develop the ability to be compatible with the pressures that come from a more complex social environment, while school can be their first step to practicing such ability. Secondly, it is necessary for children to learn and apply team collaboration skills in order to overcome some difficulties that could not be solved by a single person. Finally, school is the first platform that enables children to develop their own networking, which is a kind of wealth that can help their personal development in the future. For example, many typical famous people like Napoleon Bonaparte, and Winston Churchill all started to develop strong social networking since they were in school, and the networking provided them with vital help on their path to success.\nIn conclusion, I can understand why people might want children to be taught at home, but I strongly hold the opinion that itÃ¢ÂÂs better for childrenÃ¢ÂÂs development to send them to school.",

    "essay": "In regards to the notion 'it is important for children to go to school', there are two contrasting opinions of supporting it and also disagreeing with it. Schools are conceptually thought to be essential and compulsory for many parents while others may not despite of what the society says.\nThere are people who suggest that going to school is indeed necessary for children and students as it enables them to develop social ability and make friends which will ultimately be useful in the future. Attending school, a microsom of society, itself already teaches young students how to interact with other people ouside of family tree. Those who did not attend school when they were young may have severly low EQ or lacking interaction ability. For instance, an adult who was studying at home might not know how to respect and share objects with others. By being enrolled in a school, children can make remarkable childhood memories that may help them in the future when they are in a slump or depression.\nOn the other hand, some people may disagree to this notion as they think studying at home is far more effective. Their argument might be that going to school would be a waste of time as children usually play around at school. Teaching children can be much more efficient as transportation time and playing time can be eliminatied by not going to school. Furthermore, as children do not have to go out, there will not be any conflicts on bullying or fight with friends. They will not fall onto deviation such as smoking, drinking et cetera which are usually encountered at school due to bad friends. Also, money can be saved by teaching at home as uniforms, for example, do not have to purchased.\nAll in all, although young students might have number of advantages by not going to school, it is nevertheless more important to attend school in a daily basis to improve their social ability and interaction with other people.",

    "essay": "In regards to the notion 'it is important for children to go to school', there are two contrasting opinions of supporting it and also disagreeing with it. Schools are conceptually thought to be essential and compulsory for many parents while others may not despite of what the society says.\nThere are people who suggest that going to school is indeed necessary for children and students as it enables them to develop social ability and make friends which will ultimately be useful in the future. Attending school, a microsom of society, itself already teaches young students how to interact with other people ouside of family tree. Those who did not attend school when they were young may have severly low EQ or lacking interaction ability. For instance, an adult who was studying at home might not know how to respect and share objects with others. By being enrolled in a school, children can make remarkable childhood memories that may help them in the future when they are in a slump or depression.\nOn the other hand, some people may disagree to this notion as they think studying at home is far more effective. Their argument might be that going to school would be a waste of time as children usually play around at school. Teaching children can be much more efficient as transportation time and playing time can be eliminatied by not going to school. Furthermore, as children do not have to go out, there will not be any conflicts on bullying or fight with friends. They will not fall onto deviation such as smoking, drinking et cetera which are usually encountered at school due to bad friends. Also, money can be saved by teaching at home as uniforms, for example, do not have to purchased.\nAll in all, although young students might have number of advantages by not going to school, it is nevertheless more important to attend school in a daily basis to improve their social ability and interaction with other people.",

    "essay": "Many people claim that home based education is most appropriate for the childrens and their progress, while others believe that studying at school is more import. While teaching children at home might be useful for getting better score and children be more included, I personally am of the opinion that school based education is far outweigh in areas like socializing and it's more important for the future life.\nIt is often said that when childrens studying at home is better for their development. When student has no distractions such as classmates and school drama and sometimes bullying they are more involved and motivated to study and get good assignments. Moreover, they have less stress comparing themselves to others. For example, during the pandemic of Covid-19 students all over the world were transeffered for home education and this process brought big educational success to all of them. Overall, home base education has one very big benefit among all others, it is the posibility for student to be more focused on education without any distractions.\nHowever, education at school has their pros too and most important of them is socializing. For every person is very important to know how to work, deal and socialize with other people and it's very good when someone can learn it in the school rather than in adult life. For instance, University of Latvia in their research in 2008 proved that students who studied at school are more socialized and are bigger part of the community in their adult life than students came from home based education. In conclusion, school based education is good for styding not only school programm, but also real life.\nFrom my perspective, socializing skills outweight the educational success as it's more important for an adults life.\nTo conclude, both methods of education either home based or school based have their benefits. Every person should decide for themselves what is better for them or their childrens.",

    "essay": "Recently, many countries have legalized gay marriage. However, there are many people who do not agree with that, and claim that it has a bad influence on the education of children, and the evolution of society. However, in my opinion, I think it is a good opportunity for homosexual people as they are now understood by others, and have the right to have children despite of their situation.\nTo begin, there are many parents, for example, who tend to believe that because of the access to gay marriage, their children will find it normal to fall in love with a person from the same sex. As a result, more and more children will become homosexual, which is unconventional as far as the parents are concerned. However, I believe that it is not because children understand the fact that being gay is normal, that they will be influenced by this. In fact, they will be able to compassionate for people who struggle to express their homosexuality, so they will help them to feel more comfortable with that. Moreover, they will be more open-minded which is very important for children development.\nSecondly, many other people are convinced that gay marriage will inevitably tends towards a decrease of the young population as gay individuals can not have their own kids. As a consequence, This phenomenon represents a threat because young people will not be able to take over for the future. However, I am not of this opinion. I think that such a decrease in young people population will not occur as the vast majority of the world's population in not homosexual. Moreover, by allowing gay marriage, gay couples will be able to adopt children. Indeed, due to the fact that they are not able to give rise to new-born, they can adopt children who are abandonned, and give them the opportunity to live in a new family with good conditions.\nTo conclude, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a good opportunity for the development of the society. Indeed, not only it makes children more open-minded, which is important for their own development, but also gives for those who are unfortunately abandonned, a safe environment to thrive in.",

Many countries in Europe or Asia supported the legal marriage in LGBTQs, howere in some religious culture, the topic are very sensitive to be discussion and in worsely the LGBTQs were banned.\nLove and being in the relationships depend on people' s mutual feeling. There is no boundaries of love, even they have same gender or different races, or even speak the different languages. Therefore, if they decided to settle down and live the rest of their lives together, the social determinants will be no longer to influence the relationship.\nIt is acceptable for the caring and understanding to maintain their marriage lives. As long as they could stay together and share thick or thin time together. The couple could have the good qualities of lives, some developed countries supported and launched legal LGBTQs marriage.\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree with legal LQBTQs marriage, so far they could share the moment together , they could extend their life expectancy and they could build the everlasting love until the last days of their lives.

    "essay": "Homosexual marriage has always been a topic of a great contrast of opinions among people. Many people view it as a legal right for individulas to marry whatever person, regardless of gender, they consider as a suitable partner. Others, however, believe that gay marriage should be illegal, as it spreads the notion that being gay is normal.\nCertainly, both paries make some sound arguments supporing their views, and it is not effortless to decide which side to pick. Nevertheless, governments should not be basid towards any party's views, and a decision from the government must be based on the values and principles of its nation.\nPeople supporing gay marriage claim that governments and individuals should not have the right to decide for people who to marry, as it damages the well-being of those individulals. Moreover, they argue that gayness is not a new tread that has just given a birth, but a natural behavior that has been existed among some types of animals for centuries.\nPeople opposing gay marriage, however, claim that such a behavior will destory society as gay partners cannot reproduce, and thus, the population number will start gradually decrease. Opposiers also ague that if gay marriage was a natural behavior, religion would have advised to do it rather than giving severe warning for people who practice such behavior.\nIn conclusion, while both sides have countless followers, many governments around the world are leaning towards being fine with homosexual marriage. Personally, I think that every individual has the right to do whatever he desires as long as he does not affact others in the process.",

    "essay": "Some people strongly blame that the government does not control the rise in obesity in children. Although the government needs to take responsibility to some extent, I disagree with this idea.\nFirstly, people need to consider, who needs to take responsibility for raising children. It is obviously their parents. This means that if parents gave well controlled, and balanced nutritious food to children, it would be possible to prevent the rise in obesity. Therefore, parents need to consider their children's health as a top priority, instead of criticizing the government. Therefore, parents first need to master cooking.\nOn the other hand, some countries face a high percentage of obesity in children is higher than in other developed countries. This means that some food that contains too much sugar might be sold cheaper than healthy food, vegetable, chicken, fish, and so on. Therefore, parents who are suffering from poverty tend to choose cheaper, and unhealthy food. This is understandable that governments need to control the prices between healthy food and too much sugar and fat contained food.\nFinally, in my opinion, however, some food contains too much sugar, fat, and too high calories are cheaper, so parents need to consider their children's health as the first priority. Although the government controlled the food prices between unhealthy food and wholesome food, the parents continued choosing unhealthy food and never cooked meals, and the rise in obesity in children remains the same. Therefore, the most important point is parents need to educate themselves about nutrition and observe their children's diet. If they learned and made some effort to provide healthy food to children, the percentage of obesity will drastically drop.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, obesity is increasingly affecting children. As a result, they put their own health at stake because obesity have strong negative effects on it. Nevertheless, I believe that governments are not responsible for the rise in obesity in children as they often warn people to avoid unhealthy food, and advise them to stay in good physical condition by promoting physical activity.\nOn the one hand, there are some people who claim that governements are responsible for this phenomenon because they do not prevent big companies of fast food like Mac Donald from spreading in the country. As a result, they think that children will be increasingly attracted by this type of food.\nHowever, I do not agree with this argument. For example, USA governement has invested a lot of money in the promotion of organic food for children. In fact, more advertisements about that can now be seen regularly on TV. Moreover, a lot of canteens in schools in America have been obliged to propose healthy menus which contain organic food for children in order to keep them in good health.\nOn the other hand, other people argue that governments are keen on making profit, so they prefer to promote TV programms for children, which are very addictive, rather than physical activity. Consequently, young people do not want to do sport as they do not move constantly, so they gain weight easily.\nNevertheless, I find this argument not relevant because evidence shows that children are more active than ever before nowadays. For instance, in France, the government has constructed more than 50 000 sport facilities in the country over the 10 past years. This brought about a significant increase in children who practice sports regularly.\nTo conclude, I am conviced that governments all over the world have been putting a lot of efforts in order to prevent children from obesity, since most of them have promoted organic food as well as physical activity for young people.",

For example, if human beings explain to their kids how food influences physical and mental health and cook fresh, healthy dishes for the whole family every day, no one will want to buy fast food or even overeat.\nIn conclusion, the government is responsible the same as parents are.

    "essay": "With the development of society, people have been paying more attention to children's education. Every parent hopes that their kids can have better and more skilled to face the challenges in the future. At this time, extra classes came into being. Besides the lessons in school, children will attend different kinds of extra classes, such as classes on sports, maths, languages, arts. In my opinion, it is a worthwhile thing to do, but children shouldn't be given too much pressure.\nStudents in school usually have 5-6 classes, and after school they need develop their hobbies and have more time to do outdoor activities with their friends or classmates. In class , they get the knowledge from teachers and textbooks while after school they learn from experiencing the life, getting into nature and make connections by social skills. So I think students can have some extro classes not for studing the knowledge but for experencing, developing, and make themselves be themselves, become a whole person.\nMy son is an active boy who loves sports and he is into riding horses, play badminton and swimming. So I chose to take him to the club of horse riding on Tuesday after school . On Thursday, he will go to attend the swiming class with his friends. They not only learn the swimming skills from teacher but aslo have geat fun, and I always see his smiling face. I found that more sports and hobbies can really make the kids feel relaxed instead of some bored extra maths, languages classes. Kids need improve and learn new skills so as to have a better and brighter future, extra classes are needed ,but not too many or not too heavy.

Parents have much struggles on the arrangement regarding additional classes out of school to their children in order to gain the competitive advantages in their future career. This eassy attempts to find out the main considerations on this.\nThere is no doubt that school curriculum largely focuses on academic studies, including physical, Maths and organic chemistry etc., Those subjects are designed to connect with learning in a higher education. It is reasonable to say that this curriculum may not enable the teenagers to gain various knowledeges aspects of digital world and our planet. Learning in extra classes out of syllabus is an opportunity for them to really discover what they may be passionate about and in turn, help them develop new skills that may come in handy for a future occupation that is related.\nOn the other hand, it is not difficult to notice a lot of parents forcing their children into learning something that does not interest them. Sometimes, the intensive courses are arranged by parents to their children study at the weekends. As a result, it could lead to undesired results or even negative impacts on the parent-child relationship, so maybe it's best for children to figure it out on their own sometimes.\nMy take on this is that younsters are extremely inquisitive and energetic, consequently, it's really the prime time of their life to explore and learn new things. Studying in classes outside the syllabus are good intention, but children are forced to learn what their parents love to only. This not only ruins the parent-child relationship but also may results in children's resistance to learning.",

    "essay": "With the prevalence of sports nowadays, whether taking part in sports as a team or an individual is more beneficial has sparked off a lively debate. While many believe that playing sports as teams can elevate one's teamwork skills, others believe that playing sports alone can develop self-determination and confidence. Given that sports can be played in either conditions, I would like to discuss both perspectives before giving my opinion.\nWhen it comes to sports, most people would think of team sports such as football, basketball and volleyball. These kinds of sports can help us to evolve important life skills. Especially for children, playing team sports is an indispensible method to develop interpersonal skills. Working as a teammate helps one to build relations and communicate with one another, distributing responsibilities. As a result, the skills the children learnt will be used to cope with future life as teenagers and adults.\nAlthough playing sports alone will not gain any benefits from what I have mentioned above, it will help us to establish skills for an individual, such as self-determination and confidence, as well as concentrate for a long period. For instance, individual sports such as swimming and karate, require sportspeople to build their bravery, as well as formulate techniques to face their opponents. Therefore, even though working in teams can develop better abilities, we should not overlook the fact that doing sports as one can also volatilize its advantage.\nHaving discussed how sports played alone and as a group can develop corresponding skills, from my perspective, I reckon that playing sports in teams is more beneficial. Almost all walks of life require communication with others, so skills developed in teams are more advantageous then those in person.",

    "essay": "Doing sports has become part and parcel of our daily routine , and its beneficial effects are beyond dispute. However, which between individual or team is most useful and salutary is a question that stir up fierce debate amongst public opinion.\nTo start with, beginning a team sport activity since from the childhood has countless advantages, first of all, it helps connecting athletes one another in an engaging and ever- stimulating experience.\nSecondly, by empowering players of sharing tasks with the team, both empathy and discipline will be developed.\nNevertheless, the most common shortcoming of playing in a team is that often oneÃ¢ÂÂs overall performance can be restrained by constantly hewing to a strict tactics which leave no room for bold or creative moves, stifling any prospective talent on the rise.\nIn contrast, individual sports require a precise mindset and the natural flair for breaking the mold along with the urge to take on themselves in a never-ending clash under the banner of Ã¢ÂÂ may the best man winÃ¢ÂÂ.\nHowever, anyone can undertake such an activities, whose undoubtedly beneficial health effects, come into their own.\nAlthough the spirit of challenge is equally through the roof in comparison with team sports, the absence of mates to confront with may, in the long run, leads the individual player to become decidedly more reclusive and self-reliant.\nAccording to my experience, I would not have become companionable and self-reliant if I had not joined the basketball team when I was 9 years old. Moreover, playing with others, has helped me to pushing my limits further ahead without breaching those of my teammate, being a sort of example to follow and a beacon to turn to, in case of needs.",

    "essay": "While many regard team sports such as football and basketball are the better choices for sport, there are still some stick on to the individual sports. To my point of view, I prefer individual sports over team sports as the latter is more harmful and less beneficial from both physical and mental perspective.\nFirstly, I think sports played in groups tend to cause more harm in the forms of stress and injuries. To start, virtually all team sports are played as competitions: it must have a winnner and a loser, or losers. Since no one wish to be the stepstone of the champion, it causes a tremendous amount of stress on players' psyche. Also, many team sports inevitably requires phyiscal contacts of the players, the competitive nature of such sports often intensify the contact which some leads to injuries. Many famous sportsmen, like Jianlian Yi, one of the only two Chinese basketball players in NBA, were forced to retire early due to the injuries sustained during matches.\nOn the other hand, individual sports like swimming and joggling do not have such issues. Since one can swim or run alone, there is no such need to compete with others and cause stress. The removal of physical contact with other players also reduce the likelihood of sport injuries such as head-to-head collisions. Plus, one would focus more on how to self-improve on his/her phyiscal abilities. Moreover, some individual sports like joggling and hiking encourage people to explore mother nature. According to a study done by UBC in 2005, the higher exposure to the nature, one will have lesser likelihood to suffer mental disorders such as major depressions disorder (MDD) and general anxiety disorder (GAD).\nIn conclusion, I would say sports that played individually is has more benefits than team sports, from both the physical and mental point of views.",

    "essay": "The international student exchange is getting more popular in many high schools in big cities. This operation brings many advantages which would be beneficial for teenager students. Though, here some disadvantages still exist.\nFirstly, I think one of disadvantages is that lack of supervision on the international exchange teenagers as they are living in other countries. In general speaking, the youths felt strange and inadaptable at initial period. They canÃ¢ÂÂt speak well foreign language, canÃ¢ÂÂt communicate well with other classmates or teachers, so they might feel alone and isolate from a new circumstance. If they canÃ¢ÂÂt adjust themselves well to fit in with groups as soon as possible, they will encounter more difficult things, such as studying, social and daily routine. The worse situation is that they might give up their studying, even they will mislead them into crime.\nOn the contrary, the advantages are far more than disadvantages. For example, youths will extend their horizons. They will see and know many new things what they never seen in domestic. They would easily accept those new things than adults, because youths have curiosities all long. Furthermore, the teenagers easier to make new friends in other countries, because they are always passion and single-minded. In order to communicate with different background students from all over the world, they must cultivate their social capacities harder than before. It is the best way to elevate their skills of the foreign language is communication. Moreover, through the different viewpoint collisions the international exchange students have gained multiple and scientific logics, which will have a profound impact at the rest their lives. However, I think the simplest advantage is that most the international exchange students have possessed with an excellent foreign language ability after then come back.\nAt the end of my essay, I think it is not suit for all teenagers to be the international exchange students. Here the teenagers must accept some selection processes under the fair and effective principles.",

    "essay": "Many teachers believe that an international exchange program would benefit all adolescent students. While there are clear drawbacks to this, in my opinion the advantages are more significant. The essay will demonstrate that pupils will build life skills by joining the program. This is followed by explaining why continuing learning in the domestic school after finishing the exchange can be practicable.\nIt is obvious that the exchange program is likely to give an opportunity for students to learn to live with people from different society and nationality which is the experience that they are not able to have when studying in their country. As a result, they will have the ability to communicate with various types of people and handle challenging situations. Furthermore, there is research indicating that pupils who study in another country are able to lead a group of acquaintances under pressure.\nOn the other hand, those who oppose this may point out that when the exchange complete and the students resume their courses in the domestic school, they are perhaps unable to keep pace with others and, consequently, there might be some students who cannot pass exams. Nevertheless, the aforementioned issue can possibly be addressed by teachers to arrange extra classes for the students in order for them to learn about what they have missed when they attended the exchange program.\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that some students may find difficulty in carrying on studies in the school after the completion of the exchange, I am convinced that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. This is because children are likely to gain valuable experience which they can only have when studying aboard.",

    "essay": "International sport events such as the Olympics and the World Cup tend to be the center of attention when they are held. While many people believe that being the location of the events can bring tremendous advantages to the host, others argue that the preparation does not worth the benefits. This essay will examine the opinions of both sides.\nTo begin with, an international sport tournament leads to an abruptly economic growth as it attracts a large number of sports fans from all around the globe. Being the destination of these visitors, all hotels in the city and neighbouring areas can be fully booked and local businesses surrounding will be in turmoil to serve the tourists. For example, the Olympics usually caused all accommodations around the hosting areas to be occupied and therefore, the city can obtain additional income by setting up temporary accommodations. Nevertheless, these opportunities usually come with enormous prices.\nWith the foregoing benefits, the hosting country needs to put enormous effort into preparation prior to the event. To elaborate, in order to welcome a countless amount of visitors, the country is required to invest in constructing, maintenance, and improvement of venues and various relevant locations. As a certain level of readiness and handling standards are expected from the fans, failing to meet the expectations can lead to negative reputations of the country. Furthermore, the hosting country will also have to bear the risks that may impact the event. For example, if there is any force majeure such as a pandemic, the event may be postponed or even cancelled.\nTo conclude, the occurance of international sports events can bring significant devlopments to the host in an exchange of a great deal of investments and risks. Thus, the government must consider thoroughly before deciding to step in.",

    "essay": "Certain people believe that organizing international sports competitions could benefit host countries. While hosting sport events might also entail risks, I firmly believe that nations would gain much more than they would lose, as I will explain below.\nInternational sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people including athletes, staff, and tourists. This usually represents an attractive opportunity for local business and investors. People need to be fed, thus activating restaurants' economy. Additionally, they need a place to sleep and rest, which would benefit hotels. On the other hand, many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure, including stadiums, pools, public squares, and even airports. It is clear that several cities around the world have developed as a result of hosting such events. Let us take the example of the city Montreal in Canada, which hosted the olympic games a few decades ago. Organizing sports events also represents an opportunitty to improve the international image of a country. For example, it is not a secret that some countries such as Germany and Russia have used the World Cup to improve their international image, with positive results overall. Finally, since inhabitants of the host nation would feel inspired to practice a new sport, we could argue that competitions could additionally improve the health and wellbeing of citizens in the long term.\nIt is important to mention, however, that hosting sport events might also entail some risks. These competitions are usually complex and expensive to organize, and middle- or low-income economies could better use their resources to build vital infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. Moreover, examples around the world illustrate that some politicians see these events as an opportunity for curruption.\nIn conclusion, there are more benefits than risks for countries when it comes to hosting international sport events. These events might translate into economic opportunities for local business and investors, could bring new infrastructure, and may trigger development.",

An international sports event usually attracts a lot of audiences and tourists come to host country during the event is holding. A lot of people produce tremendous consumptions which include match tickets, transportation fees , accommodation and shopping costs.

Though, there are positive's and negative's considering how humongous the money making business around sports has evolved , the postives outweighs the negatives, which is also my opinion .\nFirstly, over the years number of people involving directly by playing a sport or indirectly by watching it has increased . This creates pressure in sports personal and the management to provide quality sports which itself is costly considering the prices of telecasting and the technological advances. Secondly, giving the sports personal proper financial aid ,boosts their performance ,as most of the athletes come from a humble background . Providing financial aid also helps them to buy quality sports gear . Thirdly , most people drop their ambition of taking sports due to poor payments than other sectors , so giving them salaries is quite hard for the sports management if there are no sponsors .\nThe business around sports has been everblooming, be it in the form of owning, sponsoring or betting. The companies, involve in sports industry with a motive of advertising their brands on large scale ,which otherwise ,is an unachievable task . The betting industry has been rising ,as it is highly lucrative considering the time and resources spent .\nOn the other hand , people also believed that too much of flow of money has created corruption in the sports sector .

The people in betting are luring players with money and fixing matches for their monetary gains which is killing the spirit of the game.\nIn conclusion, I support that high earnings in sports industry has had a positive impact on the quality of sports played and also being delivered on televisions with such quality.",

    "essay": "It is argued that using mobile devices is as antisocial as smoking and that in certain areas smoking has been forbidden so mobile devices should be prohibited as well. I strongly disagree with this statement because this would not solve the initial problem and could turn out expensive as well.\nFirstly, banning mobile devices from certain places would be exagerated. This is because smoking actually damages your body, while the use of mobile phones is comparatively harmless. For example, a recent research found out that the risk of lung cancer grows by 0,02% with every cigarette, while high screen time has less damaging side effects like the loss of concentration. Altough the use of mobile phones is sometimes antisocial, I think that we should concentrate on the origins of this problem than simply prohibit it in certain areas.\nSecondly, banning mobile devices would have a regulatory side effect which could be expensive. The government would have to decide on new laws as well as implement them. Furthermore, it would be no easy task for the police to control these rules in an efficient way. As a result, police would struggle with a high workload. Admittely, I have enough faith in our legal system and I am sure that they could manage it but I think that we have more prescious und urgent tasks to concentrate on.\nIn conclusion, I strongly disagree with banning mobile devices in certain areas. However, I admit that we use our phones too much which sometimes leads to antisocial behaviour.

    "essay": "Doing activities, either in a group or alone, play a crucial factor in terms of self-development, leading to strong skills for peopleÃ¢ÂÂs life. Despite the fact that individual activities can improve a wide variety of peopleÃ¢ÂÂs competencies, I personally believe that people would gain more benefits from participating team activities than doing individually.\nIt is true that group activities potentially strengthen peopleÃ¢ÂÂs social skills. An argument in favour of this is that team activities require participants to collaborate with other team members. As a result, the participants will not only have to do their responsibility the best, but also helping others bring out their best potential. This is because a team cannot achieve its goal by any person, but by everyone working together. Another common example is that group activities also foster peopleÃ¢ÂÂs communication skills. In order to get what the team aim to succeed, each team members must deliver their messages via conversation in the simple and understandable way. Therefore, people doing group activities are likely to expose with this experience all time, helping them being capable of communicating effectively.\nIn spite of the aforementioned advantages of doing activities as a team, it is the fact that doing individual activities also contributes to many essential skills. A classic example of this is the development in self-discipline. With respect to sports, people who doing sports alone such as running must strict with their running schedule in order to being able to run for their target distance. Another common criticism is the ability to not comparing themselves with others. When people doing activities alone, they will have to set their milestones to reach their target, meaning that they will truly understand their actual potential and not interfered by other peopleÃ¢ÂÂs progress.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that individual activities possibly help people have self-discipline and teach them to concentrate on their ability, not others. Nevertheless, after carefully contemplating the outcomes of both types of activities, I totally agree that group activities which result in better teamwork and communication skills are more important due to the fact that these competencies are the two most important factors for every people to be successful in life.",

Both ones are important in teaching life skills. Below, we will see which one of them is a great way of teaching more important life skills.\nFirst of all, we need to understand that doing activities in group, or as a team can help us deepen our knowlodge, because they provide us with the ability to share ideas and learn from each other which is something crucial in our daily lives as human being as we were all created to live together as communities. In addition, group or team activities will not only allow us to know the other person living next us but to figure out what their feelings are and to be patient to them when they need us. However, doing activities alone have also its own benefits.\nIn fact, personal activities or some of them we do alone can give us some understanding about how the world is spinning around us as well. Firsthand, sometimes we need to do a few activities alone as this can help us to develop some personal important life skills to know exacly who we really are and what is our mission on the earth. Second, doing personal activities such as walking out, or going for a walk will not only strengthen our physical being but also to be mentally healthy.\nIn conclusion, both of them have positive and negative aspects to consider.

    "essay": "There is no doubt that activities whether in group or individual considered as an important source for learning skills.These people claim that life skills can be developing and growing increasingly through team activities more than those which are done alone. This essay will argue why collaborating works against isolating ones are entirely necessary in gaining life abilities and competencies.\nIt is clear that People are usually different in their own characters and in their dealing with things. So that, some of them like to be alone and want to move on activities without sharing the others because they afraid of involving in troubles. They also think that the others may treat them jealously and enviously. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances of aggressive states inside learning circuses which sometimes made losing knowledge rather than winning new abilities. Moreover, those people may have deep fears and shy which constantly prevent them from growing among team works. For example many famous celebrities had become more creative by sitting alone. Such those ideas let people do not want to change their acceptable way in getting and learning skills for authentic life against team activities. In contrast, grouping work can overcome all obstacles in personality and teach people different kinds of skills.\nAlthough some people can success in learning all they need individually, most of them whether their age and background eagerly need contacting the others to teach them lessons about realistic life skills. Cooperating concept is important in teaching people manners for adapting through life. As previous researches of Vojytsky has declared that learners always could build knowledge while interactions directly or indirectly with others. Overall the idea of sharing activities in order to give persons opportunity to learn values and new skills is completely true despite the minor improving of lonely ones' life.\nThis essay argued that it is had better getting bit new skills in team or group work ,on the other hand its useless way to teach people activities alone. In my opinion, it is quite important and interesting way to let people contacting and teaching each other a plenty of skills in the same time. However, it is long way to guide some people teaching themselves what they need throughout the life.\n.",

    "essay": "The topic of group work can be more beneficial for peoples' lives than person who tend to do some work alone or not is widely discussed across the globe. Personally, I think there are some good advantages team activities cause our life,\nand especially in business scenes more comfortable and productive.\nInitially, only one person's work is limited, compared with group activities. This means that working only one person will be able to cause some profits to some extent. On the other hand, group working will be more productive and efficient to make more sales figures. In addition, each person has a great ability. For example, some people have great communication skills and negotiations. Those people are\nthe most appropriate roles for sales. Furthermore, some people are good at analysing the group performance quality and making strategies. Those who are good at these activities are best for marketing team. As a result, they can focus on their strong points for work and they can divide and conquer the tasks with each other.\nOf course, some people are eager to work alone at their own relaxed pace and make a profit to some extent. This is less stressful they do not need to keep attention from other colleagues. But this means that they need to decide all tasks and take all responsibility. Sometimes it might be risky once they made a mistake and caused a huge deficit.\nFinally, there is no doubt that more than two heads are better than one. People can share their experiences and opinion to improve their group activities. If some people who are sensitive and feel pressure if some people meddle in too much. It is necessary to organize some rules that must be effective. For example, all people need to try to stay positive, avoid stating negative or swear words, and not deny one person's opinion straightforwardly and emotionally. Making a great atmosphere, saying positive words with each other, and including some humor, will lead to everyone's performance being more productive.",

    "essay": "Group work is believed to foster more life skills than activities done solo. Although doing things alone is beneficial as it strengthens decision making skills, working in teams can educate more valuable life lessons as it teaches teamworking and negotiation skills necessary for living in a community.\nFirstly, working in a group helps build teamworking skills. In a team, in order to be successful in doing peojects, members need to help one another in achieving mutual goals. Therefore, through these steps, team members will be trained on assisting others to reach the goal, although they may feel more competent undergoing a project on their own. Similarly, in real societies, people living in the same community cannot be careless to their neighbors and, instead, have to understand each other. Because of this understanding, they can tolerate one another.\nStill, it can be argued that working collectively nurtures people to follow the crowd and hence, they cannot sharpen decision making skills. For this point, it is valid that a lone wolf has a clearer vision in its life direction than a pack of wolves that walk behind a leader. Still, a single leader may lead to a wrong path that ends up to a disaster for all other wolves. Thus, in order to make a right decision effectively, it is required that people work together since they can debate and negotiate what is appropriate for the team which, in turn, beneficial for each individual. Likewise, in a country, no single prime minister can dictate the country's direction. Nevertheless, opinions gathered from the parliament are necessary.\nIn conclusion, team projects are more useful in culminating skills crucial to live in a society. Teamworking skills gained from working together will lead to an understanding of other people not only in the team but in the same society. Moreover, people will be trained on negotiation and compromisation which yield better success than decisions done alone by a single person.",

    "essay": "Dinner tables are no longer a place for family reunion in today's society. Reasons from many aspects account for this phenomenon which pose a huge threat to the happiness of family and the harmony of society.\nCauses vary from person to person. Some people, especially the young believing that conflicts are common on dinner tables, tend to have meals with their friends rather than their family members. But most people are deprived of their rights by the development of society. Too busy to get home at dinner time, people have to eat meals near workplace. Also, with the job diversity increasing, rarely can family members with different timetables eat meals at the same period. For instance, a bank agent getting home at 6 pm tends to miss her doctor husband leaving home at 5 pm for emergency work.\nIt is the advantages of sharing meals with family that attach great importance to this event. Time for communication is so critical that families lacking such opportunities are often full of misunderstandings and quarrels. Not only can this development increase the divorce rate but it may also decrease the marriage rate. Because support and care from family, the previous harbor, is deprived and people see no significance from getting married. With such phenomenon prevailing, the negative emotions may take advantage in the society. Loneliness, distress and helplessness stike those always eating alone.\nIn a nutshell, taking the damage to both families and societies into consideration, various solutions should be put forward to the roots behind the situation.",

    "essay": "The topic indicated that the family members no longer eat meals together in the modern society. The reason are complex and the phenomenon is inevitable.\nI think the first factor is that the pressure from the modern age has increased. More and more family members busy on their jobs and studies. They undergo more pressures than ever have before. For example, a father who very busy at work, he usually work extra hours and social with his clients. His schedule is volatile thus he has to give up his time to eat meals with his family members. The second factor is that family members have their own schedules in the fast-moving world. Furthermore, the more social activities lead sophisticated to people's lifestyle. For example, a family member who goes to fitness center after work, he eat by individual instead eat meal together. The third factor is that the scale of family members has decreased, more and more family members left their hometown for the new place, like urban or big city. They cannot eat together due to geographical separation. Probably a family member eat meals by individual whom might feel lonely and insulated.\nOn conclusion, this social phenomenon is an evident of the changing society. Obviously, family member eat meal together that help them to reinforce their relationships each other and create a good communication among them. It would be a happiness moment when family members eating together. But the fact we have to accept is that the society is changing.",

    "essay": "Some people argue that people less frequently gather around a table at meals with their family members, due to a number of factors such as changing trends in the living style and weakened relations between parents and children. I strongly believe that this has a devastating effect on the future of society.\nCompared to half of a century ago, the habits of especially big-city dwellers have experienced a dramatic shift in recent years. While people get used to living in extended families, today they tend to live in smaller families called celullar families. In the following step, isolation became much more significant that children aged over 18 years prefer to move to a separate house. Additionally, even individuals who live with their family rarely share daily activities including eating meals, mainly related to different and busy working schedules. Apparently, the residents of the metropolis are reluctant to spend their time because of the increased incidence of depression or other psychologic disorders.\nA growing body of evidence indicates that as people choose to do their activities alone, their family bonds are also negatively affected. As a physician, from my point of view, children who are raised in this environment are more likely to become antisocial and unsuccessful in both academic and social life. Furthermore, most of these young persons suffer from psychiatric disorders which are remarkably infrequent among people who keep in touch with their relatives. Also, these youngsters are more commonly committed crimes such as drug trafficking, robbery or, even murder.\nIn conclusion, quitting daily activities that are done together is the initial step of falling apart for family members which inevitably leads to worse outcomes for the society like increased risk of crime and psychiatric problems.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, with all the technology and studies involved in sports, it is very important the amount of strength and muscle develop that athletes must have, as much as, the mental training, to confront hard moments and be able to overcome. There are people who believe that physical strength is the key for success, on the contrary, others think that mental strength is most important for being successful. While muscle and physical preparation are the main reason to overcome on weaker opponents. Mental strength, in my perspective, is the most important because provides something special and unbreakable that last longer and gives more than just muscle power.\nOne the one hand, it is the physical strength. Which provides more energy for developing and performing better in sports, such as soccer, tennis, golf with better and precises strikes on the ball. Although, gives an important advantage on weaker opponents in therms of power, mobility and speed among others, for instance, boxing against a 20 pounds lighter fighter. In global, physical strength is a good and simple reason to overcome weaker athletes.\nOn the other hand, it is the phychological factor or Ã¢ÂÂthe headÃ¢ÂÂ. Which deliver more reciliense and will to win in stress and critic situations, like the final match in the last set of a grand slam. Also, good mental state allows to compensate the strengh, muscle and energy of opponents by focalizing the attention on last longer, that is the case of runners in marathon and ultramarathons. In the end, menthal power deliver something special, not measurable and unbreakable that last longer than just physical power.\nIn my opinion the most powerfull weapon that all athletes have is the mental strength, it is more powerful than any muscle, provides resilience to fatigue and focus in stressed times.\nIn summary, physical strength provides advantage on many aspects of sports, such as energy, velocity and movement. Nevertheless, mental strength is the key to succes in high quality sportsmans",

    "essay": "Champions have been heralded across cultures and religions for centuries. Hercules from Greek mythology and Samson from the Bible were known for their strength. Hermes, the messenger of the Greek gods adorned winged sandals to grant him the speed of wind. From ancient to current times, champions have shared their skills via sports. But a question has arisen. What takes presedence, brain or brawn?\nFor those who believe that physical strength is important for success in sport, we must consider the effort put into performing said activities. Running a marathon is easier said than done! Raising over 500kg above your head doesn't happen overnight, or rowing in appealing synchronization without training. Athletes train in gyms for countless hours by running on treadmills, strength training and doing plyometrics to develop the power in order to effectively perform their respective sports, thus proving the importance of physical strength to prevail in sports.\nOthers believe that in order to distinguish between the average and the greats, mental strength is the factor that does so. The amount of discipline, perserverance and other psychological strengths allow athletes to set world records. Former world's strong man, Eddie Hall has stated that he had used techniques from psychologists to unlock parts of the brain that provide super strength similar to that people use in life threatening situations to lift cars to save their children. He was able to become the first man to deadlift over 500kg. Though not as extreme, sportsmen and women must apply some form of mental strength to push themselves to achieve record-level excellence in sports.\nI believe that brain and brawn harmoniously work together to create exceptional champions in sports. Physical strength is the baseline that allows athletes to perform their skills with endurance, and mental strength is the value needed to push them to go one step ahead of their competition. Sportmen must be able to run, lift, or even row without issue, as well as try, try, and try again, working through limiting beliefs so that they can become apart of sporting history.",

    "essay": "It is often argued out there about sports, debating about both physcial and mental strengths and which is far more crucial to the success. This essay will go over these two points of view in further depth and outline some expamples, where relevant, for each.\nOn one side, some people think that the most important factor to succeeding in sports is the physical strength. Body strength is actually quite indispensable in any sport activity, especially those types of sports that demand a high fitness level and high physical endurance, etc, such as MMA fights, wrestling, football, and so on. All of these require an elevated and advanced charachterestics of one's body. For example, an athlete can not keep up a football match and running around for 90 minutes without a high body endurance, fitness, so on and so forth.\nOn the other hand, the others believe that a powerful mentality and mindset are needed for such success and accomplishment. That is, they believe that one's attitude is the first key to success before anything else. People need to have some sort of a mindset with specific qualities, such as perseverance, determination, concentration, etc. and it's not always about havign a massive body strength. For example, some MMA athletes step in the ring with solid bodies, will not always win the games if they're not determined and persistent already, altought their opponents do not have that huge bodies. It's all about the mindset.\nIn conclusion, it's not easy to decide which of these two criteria is more important than the other. However, I believe that any athlete must have these two, train them both before getting into any challenge, no matter what type of activity. An athlete must have a strong body and a trained attitude once and for all.",

    "essay": "Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. This essay will discuss both these views with examples and show that while some people esteem physical strength, it is important to think of mental stretgth as a companion of physical strength which give any person in sports agility and flexibility.\nPhysical strength has been supported by many people as an important factor for success in sport. Those who think that physical strength is more important believe that it is a person's physique that is required to win any sport. For instance, in a study conducted by the Australisn National Team among sport fanatics in Perth, 80% of participants stated that physical strength was everything that any person involved in any kind of sport required to be succesful. Some participants in this study cited soccer as one such sport requiring physical strength. These findings were supported by another study conducted by a PhD student at the University of Sydney. The student concluded that while mental strength was important in any physically inclined sport, it was difficult to measure brain resources recquired to engage in sports like running.\nOn the other hand, some people think that mental strength gives stamina and agility to any person involved in sports. One prominent argument in this school of thought is that the body is a slave of the mind. Every action taken by the body is a response to the triggers initiated in the mind. Therefore, nourishing and strengthening mental capacity translates to physical strength. In a research study conducted among college students in America, it was found that mental strength was more esteemed than physical strength. It was argued in this study that mental strength was the breath that gave life to physical strength.\nIn conclusion, it can be argued that the reality of both mental and physical strength and their role in supporting a succesful sports career is not painted in black and white. A physically strong person needs to use their mental strength to plan and outwit their opponent. They also need tact and flexibility of the body which stem from the coordination between the body and the mind. As such, both mental and physical strength are important in supporting a successful sports career.",

    "essay": "The use of social media nowadays is widespread around the world. As the use of new techonology grows, people concern about what will be impact of this change. Some people argue the use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among people, which will lead to negative impacts on the society. Whereas, Others claim that the benefits from the use of social media outweigh the negative impacts. Which one is true? I will compare these two perspectives and state my opinion in this essay.\nThere is no denying that the use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction to some extent. People use social media to connect with other people. This kind of behaviors decrease the aspiration of real life interaction. However, using social media can not give the same feeling as a face-to-face interation. There is lack of intimacy and empathy. For this reason, it is easy to fall in lonelyness while occupied in social media.\nHowever, sometimes the use of social media assists the interactions in real life. For example, friends who are far away from each other can interact in social medias. This helps to keep their relationship which can lead to a face-to-face interaction in the future. Moreover, some people even find out their lover through social medias.\nIn my opinion, the argument that the use of social media will replace face-to-face interaction is a little bit exaggerated. After all, most people use social media to assist their real life relationship, not to completely replace their face-to-face interactions with online chattings. The use of social media might replace some portion of face-to-face interaction, but in most cases, it will help us to connect with other people, and promote our real life interactions.",

    "essay": "The modern world of social interaction changed completely over the past decades. Now many of us spent much more time interracting through social media, messengers for private or corporate messaging. We also use video conference and sharing our workflow remotely.\nAs for me we have different needs satisfied by communication formed by different systems in our brain. On the one hand we have we communicate with each other aiming to get a useful information. On the other hand communication gives some non-verbal part like a sense of neing involved into one process, belonging to a circle of friends, collegues or family. These two sides of the process of communication are implemented differently that's why each part gets its own advantages and disadvantages thanks to changing integrating new social network technologies.\nIf to talk about an information exchange - as for it became much more efficient with using messages, cloud storages and different coworking tools. But it is true only for those people who use these technology well. As far as I can see many advantages in remote work such as possibility not to waste time for commuting, offices and separate equipment, many people notice that their remote collegues disapperar often and avoid their duties. Some people couldn't concentrate while working at home. As for me people who experince such a problems are just addicted to strong stimules such as face-to face interraction and being managed by their boss. At the same time different internet based tools allow you to share much more information much faster and forever. Now you cannot just forget you task because you can always revise it in your work messenger and cloud folder wherever and whenever you are.\nOne another need - is to have a social interraction. Of course ssocial network give us some advantage even in this area - now we can keep our relationships with more people across longer distances. While moving to another city or country we do not feel isolation so much anymore. It allows us to mentain or ralationships longer and stronger. At the same time such an option give people a possibility to avoid face-to-face communication with people phisically close to them. As for me it gives only one disadvantage - it is getting harder to load some parts of our brain which are evolutionary oriented to face-to-face interraction.\nI can conclude that social media interraction gave us some new possibilities and cut off some of the old ones.

Lastly, consumer's lack of knowledge and misinformation regarding their product as evident by the coca cola lawsuit.\nAlthough it may be difficut for people to stay away from this. There are ways that can help them drink less. One solution is for government to impose a price hike. Meaning high price can discourage them to buy this drinks. Second, just like alcohol, buying sugar-based drinks at malls or grocery store should have time limit. For instance, whoever will buy and sell beyond the allotted time should pay a fine.

    "essay": "Many people argue that individuals can't do nothing to resolve the environmental problems of our times. Personaly, I partially disagree with this statement and in this essay I will go through some of the arguments that back my opinion.\nOn one hand, I have to agree with this statement. Many of the environmental problems that we are currently facing are caused by large companies and not by individuals. Whether it's pollution, deforestation or contamination, the indivual doesn't have as much impact as these entities have. Therefore, governements should take care of the problem rather than passing into the current citizen. In addition, the solutions that are needed to take place require an important political and economical influence. Only the governments are available to put in place the measures needed to counter-balance this situation.\nOn the other hand, waiting to be saved by the governments and institutions is not the right attitude. Individuals, while not having the same impact, can spark the change that is needed in order to take care of this problem. Not only that but citizens can make their contribution by applying some small measures than by itselfs aren't noticeable but when summed up can have a positive impact. For example, recycling their food waste or using ecological friendly products are habits that we can all do. If only one person does it, it won't have any effect, but it does when it's done by one million,\nIn conclusion, it can be said that both sides are needed in order to make a positive change on the current situation. This can start from the individual to then put in motion a bigger change.",

    "essay": "Individuals, who are willing to develop the environment are quite limited. Some people say it is almost nothing they can do. Therefore, governments and large companies need to improve the environment and it must be a large impact for society. I strongly disagree this opinion, because individuals also make a difference for the environment to some extent.\nInitially, there is no doubt that governments, large companies and organizations have a large initiative to change the environment. For example, in Europe, especially in Germany, they are planning to make some restrictions on car industries not to manufacture cars which consume only petrol as energy in near future. Therefore, even in some sports car companies started releasing a new type of car which take advantage of electricity, which is a sustainable resource. Therefore, governments and companies control peoples' lifestyle.\nOn the other hand, people have already become aware of dangerous environment they are on the line. Therefore, many people voluntarily started to pick up garbage on the street and seaside. They also purchase sustainable bottles, instead of tapping into plastic bottles. In addition, technology has advanced in a few decades, and some influencers on the internet warn about issues of the environment. This means that individuals regardless of generation start to make some communities on social media and hold some events. For example, they discuss what they can do in their daily routine to reduce the consumerism, and which materials are realistically sustainable stuff in our lifestyle. As a result, some people start to establish a company geared towards eco-friendly company. For example, some companies launched the project to manufacture the solar panel and make strategies on how to spread them around the world as a sustainable and renewable resource.\nFinally, of course, large companies and governments have a large power to control\nthe environment more beautifully. On the other hand, these organizations also configured by individuals. Therefore, governments need to add an environment subject in the curriculum at school. Consequently, more people start to consider on how to improve the environment in a large organization, the more people will suggest and make specific plans individually. If the ideas were rejected, they can post these ideas on the internet and people will come together to make a specific project.\nIn conclusion, individuals can do a lot of options by taking advantage of the internet and the influences are getting larger.",

Unless through laws created by the government and activities have been taken by companies that have a high impact. I strongly disagree with this idea. because there are other ways to help the government as an individual.\nIn essay will prove my point with reasons and examples.\nNowadays, people can use social media as a platform that has the power to tell people around the world how to behave. Therefore, an individual has the power to convince others to give higher attention to our environment and create a community that has specific goals to improve. For example, social media influencers could educate the volunteer and work with the youth to make the environment better. For instance, show the young people how to sort the waste and how dangerous the impact is if they do not act in such as way.\nMoreover, as individuals, people can start doing many actions which benefit the environment by themselves without obstructions. On the other hand, the government and companies should be aware too. For example, while the companies use the factories the government must be monitoring the discharge of fule.\nIn conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view, in my opinion, it is not necessary to wait for the government and the big companies to act activity for the environment because we as individuals can create and provide educational activities for the public to preserve the environment for the next generation.",

    "essay": "An ideal society where people co-exist in perfect harmony and respect, regardless of race, beliefs, or gender, is a universally desired idea. Although striving for these ideals would benefit the individuals, I strongly believe that an ideal society can never be achieved because itÃ¢ÂÂs unrealistic.\nStriving for an ideal society would benefit the individuals because nobody can live better unless they learn to think better. To begin with, virtues such as courage, fairness, and respect are admirable character traits that everyone should try to pursue. If individuals can become better versions of themselves, then the whole community would surely become better. Moreover, different people will have different versions of an ideal society. Hence, encouraging people to actively and critically think about how they can lead better lives will lead to a more open-minded, robust, and tolerant community.\nWhile itÃ¢ÂÂs beneficial for individuals to work on self-improvement, an ideal society can never be created or maintained. Firstly, people are selfish and will pursue their self-interest at the expense of the group. If I can get ahead by taking more resources than my neighbor, then why shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt I take more? Upon seeing me do that, others will envy and start taking more for themselves. Consequently, competition and discord within society are inevitable. Secondly, progress canÃ¢ÂÂt be made unless stronger groups get ahead and wipe out less adaptable ones. Examples include factories replacing farming cultures and technology replacing manual labor.\nIn conclusion, although striving towards the ideals is beneficial to individuals within communities, the ideal society could never be achieved due to its impracticality. Schools, governments, and communities should nevertheless encourage people to actively think and work on becoming better versions of themselves.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, in western civilization, there is a debate on people who think to create an ideal society but why they are not able to achieve this. In this essay, I will give my point of view of an ideal society and after I will explain the methods to create this society.\nTo begin with, from my experience and perspective, I believe that the ideal society is a place without criminals and serious offenders. A community without crime is a wonderful and safe place for our children and our families to live in harmony without rapes, thefts and murders. For example, in an isolated village outside a theme park in Canada, the locals lived with rules and culture without violence and crimes and everybody was happy and satisfied with their jobs and social life. Furthermore, the local community was very well balanced without arguments and conflicts because of the lack of serious offenders and criminals.\nOn the other hand, the creation of an ideal society is something very difficult. I honestly believe that the only way to build a balanced community is to educate our children because they are the future of this world and they need good examples and knowledge to create a good character. For instance in Ancient Athens, Greece local politicians and philosophers were responsible to educate the young people not only in school but also in the street or open theatres. As a result of this action, young people received knowledge and fundamentals to be ideal citizens of ancients Athens.\nTo conclude, from my point of view there is no place for crimes and offences in an ideal society because these will destroy the balance and the harmony of the people. Furthermore, proper education is the best way to help our children to build good characters and balanced lifestyles.",

    "essay": "The topic of whether students should choose a specific specialized in limited subjects or all students need to study a wide range of subjects until they graduate school, has been discussed across the world, including in Japan. Although there are some benefits to the education system which specialize in some specific subject, I think to learn wide range of subjects until they leave school.\nFor example, there are some courses which focus on some specific industry in Japan. Specifically, it is geared toward hair stylists, IT programming, and entertainment. It is useful for them to learn the specific curriculums earlier might be advantageous to master these techniques. Especially, when it comes to entertainment, younger talented people tend to be evaluated higher than older talented people.\nOn the other hand, there are some benefits to learn a variety of subjects until they leave high school. For example, learning mathematics will allow us to boost some skills to predict and solve some issues logically. And learning English will be an essential tool to communicate with people worldwide. In addition, people have often required a variety of educational knowledge in daily conversation, especially in the workplace. This means that learning a wide range of subjects is helpful to bear out their variety of educational backgrounds.\nFinally, it might be difficult for teenagers, especially fifteen years old students to decide which occupation, and industry they would like to work. Teenagers have often deluded and changed their idea about which occupation is suitable for them, however, they have some specific dreams in advance. Therefore, learning a wide range of subjects will be helpful to decide a variety of occupations in the future. This means that if students had learned a wide range of subjects until high school, it will be helpful to consider a long time and let them decide on a variety of job occupations. Then, they should choose the specific faculty they would like to learn at university.",

    "essay": "Education programs are different from one area to another area, there are systems that learners are required to choose restricted number of courses for their academic curriculum by the age of 15.while,other educational systems ask students to take comprehensive courses until they graduate from school. There are many positives for both trends, in my opinion limited range of academic subjects education system is better.\nOn the one hand, it is basic knowledge to accept the idea that pupils who study selected number of subjects from age of fifteen are more informative academically in specified field of study. For example, when student decide to take medical subjects from early age the student will be prepared by tutors completely for the nominated curriculum,as a result all the student's focus will be on medical topics thus, the student is more qualified to practice medicine more efficiently after school graduation.Furthermore, this system will build a solid knowledge background in limited range of subjects can help to develop creativity at early age.Moreover, in the financial view point it may be better for students to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15; selected number of academic subjects means less money allocated for educational services by guardians.\nOn the other hand, it is true to claim that general subjects system can prepare students to be more informative in various different live aspects. Since, students who register with wide range subjects system can gain academic knowledge and support in fields such as mathematics,physics,medicine,and....ect. Therefore,those students can select more than one speciality to practice as a professionalism in future.Besides, wide range system help to improve social interactions better,because friends will not be separated and they continue school education together until graduation,inaddition there is chance to make more friends as primises are more crowded.\nTo sum up, educational systems main target is to develop and progress academic background of students.But, in my opinion,it is better to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15 due to reasons like: solid academic background in specific field,creativity,and less financial burden on parents.",

    "essay": "The is a common belief that studentsÃ¢ÂÂ focus on selected subjects from secondary school is beneficial for their school results. However, it is a more persuasive argument that students studying a wide range of subjects throughout their school life is more applicable for their future.\nOn the one hand, studying a limited range of subjects from 15 years ago helps students to develop specific abilities. Once they decide on their stream of subjects such as art, science, or commerce, they will be focused on special training. This teaching method can help them to become a specialist or professionals. For instance, in China, over 500 business schools are opened to train students to become specialists in the business field. Students can apply to those schools when they turn 15. According to a statistic from one of the business schools, 70% of their students received high scores in the national exam.\nNevertheless, a wide range of subjects is more suitable for students to develop their intelligence. Students can student various knowledge from different aspects, they can choose the subject they are interested in most. Moreover, students can have a longer time to study before choosing their faculty at university. Numbers of basic knowledge and longer time to consider helping them make the best decision for themself. Students are motivated to do their best. For example, over 90% of students at the Norway University claimed that they are satisfied with studying all subjects before choosing a university. They have a full idea of what they like and dislike. They found that school life is excited and full of happiness.\nTo sum up, it is apparent that students can be well-developed in a specific subject with a limited range of choices, however, it is undeniable that a wide range of subject can develop their real interests.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, due to a wide range of education methods and systems, there are a lot of opinion and debates for which being the best orientation for students. Some experts believe that it is good for pupil to only focus on a few subjects during their school life. However, some criticisms argue that the more subject students have, the more practical knowledge they can require. For me, both of such education systems might have different benefits for students as well as I prefer the latter rather than the former.\nFirst of all, there may have some evidence for people to reckon the upsides of concentration on mainly subjects, Considering the fact that learning too many subjects can be very time-consuming and they may feel confused as well as overwhelmed when they gain a lot of knowledge at the same time. Given a circumstance, students who are studying in Hong Kong must take the DSE every year from the age of fifteen, the Hong Kong examination and Assessment Authority recommends students do not choose more than seven subjects during the exam. Result from having more practices as well as revisions as much as they can. Hence, if students would like to do a test, they could be more suitable to study the primary subjects.\nConversely, some criticisms considered that it is probably good for students to pick up variety of subjects in view of finding their interests and avoiding spoon feed information. Since many educators think that Hong Kong education system is too exam-oriented, this way could harm students mental and physical health. For instance, parents who are from Hong Kong complain about the education curriculums are too concentrated on spoon feed information rather than giving more life experience to students once in a while. That is why parents sometimes enjoy to choose various of study tours as well as extra curriculums for their children. Thus, some people tend to having more immersing the experience more than studying a few of subjects in their young age.\nIn summarize, it is hard to say which opinion would be the best since different types of education methods may have their advantages and disadvantages. On the other hand, personally, it is the key that pupils will never know what they can done until they tried. That is the reason why I prefer studying vary subjects in their young age than being an expert in the major part.",

    "prompt": "The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
    "essay": "For many years, the traditional teaching and learning (T&L) approach, i.e., having a teacher disseminating knowledge to a group of students in a classroom, is dominent over the world.\nWith the advancement of information and communication technology, new learning approaches have been proposed and adopted. For example, students can now use computers to surf the internet to find information or knowledge they would like to study. Moreover, a number of pre-recorded education contents are now available online to provide classes/tutorials to learners. It is expected that this tradition T&L approach will not exist by 2050. Would it be true?\nThere is no doube that there is an increasing number of T&L approaches due to emergence of new technologies. Together with the new approaches, we see there is a shift of the role of teachers these years, not only as one who is responsible to disseminate knowledge, but also a faciliator of learning. Teachers provide proper directions to students during their study, where current technology is not able to offer. Some people say the artificial technology is a threat, but still the accuracy of providing suggestions to students is not very high. Moreover, human teachers are able to provide emotional support to students. Studying is not just a robotic process of human beings. Students may encounter difficulties during the learning process and feel frustrated, which will eventually affect their progression in study. Human teachers could be more aware on this situation, not by the numeric assessment results, but the emotional behaviour of the students in the classroom, and provide prompt and proper counselling support and advice to the students.\nAlso, it is still well-known that computers, even with AI, are weak in creating new knowledge. In the university setting, other than teaching the conventional knowledge, professors would disseminate their new research findings to the students in the class, with discussion among the students, inspiring them to the unexplored areas. This T&L process can only be effective when it happens in a classroom setting.\nIn conclusion, technology may alter the way how we teach and learn. In spite of this, human teachers are also adaptive and certain roles of the teachers cannot be replaced by other tools or machines. Therefore, I believe that the tradition classroom T&L setting cannot be replaced completedly in the future.",

    "prompt": "Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?",
    "essay": "Councils are debating if building housing areas on expanded land is a better solution than providing taller dwellings. It might be an extremely complicated choice, considering the skyrocketing rise of number of people in the world and the change in prefering a walk-distance city. This essay will explore the optimal solutions for cities layout.\nAlthough the ideal solution might depend on what the cities are aiming for, under a generic point of view, it would be optimal to have dwellings compacted in a dimished size of land. The first justification is that cramping everything in a reduced area and growing tall allowes all the residents to reach shops and workplaces in dwindling time through walking, public transport or eco-friendly vehicles. Moreover, taking in account the overall incresing of population's density, with the creation of a taller layout, a sustainable market demand will be shown.\nNowadays, the antiquated method of construct residences on a wider area of land is not feasible. In most locations, cities are running out of vacant lands, in fact many single houses are occupying vast areas for luxury amenities for a limited family, when a building can be erected accomodating many households. Furthermore, an implementation in infrustracture, such as roads and parking, will be needed. If individuals are not able to arrive to destination without a private car, due to long distances to cover, more highway will be required, therefore more lands is taken away for agglomerate of dwellings and business offices.\nTo conclude, the world is shifting toward a highly populated areas, so that councils need to keep up to date with convinient cities layout, like skyscrapers rather than single houses, to ease people lifestyles and reduced citizens' footprint.",

    "essay": "Some big cities, especially in Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama in Japan tend to build taller buildings like skyscrapers. Other local cities and places where are scarcely populated are built wider. This is quite understandable in terms of space, and there might be some solutions to dissipate populations around Japan.\nInitially, the main reason why people tend to gather in big cities is that there are many opportunities to get a job. There are famous headquarter companies and branches that are based in foreign countries. Therefore, more and more people move to the big cities so that many taller apartments and buildings are built to let them live in the limited space. There seems to be stressful due to people being densely populated, but infrastructures are well organized, especially transport, medical care, and security.\nIn contrast, the population in the countryside becomes less. Therefore, there is plenty of space to build houses in the wider area. It seems to be well-relaxed and comfortable to live in a slow-paced lifestyle. But, it is apparently more difficult to obtain a new job, and lacking transport, so they need to rely on cars. In addition, the number of hospitals is much smaller than big cities. These issues are long controversial as a first world problem.\nFinally, as Covid-19 spread worldwide, many people are started to work at home with a lap top computer. Innumerable companies adopted IT systems that are able to work remotely. In addition, some companies had already stated this systemized working style will not change, however, Covid-19 completely ended. This means that many people do not necessarily need to live in big cities. Therefore, if the transport system is well organized, especially establishing and improving a train, which works faster and more frequently. This effort will be not only helpful to dissipate the population outside of the big cities, but also promotive to tackling with great infrastructures to countrysides.\nIn conclusion, as a result, the densely populated cities will be able to reduce its population and increase the population in the countryside. As a result, some issues will be resolved and become well-balanced solutions. Finally, it might be able to build wider houses in big cities with reasonable prices than now.",

    "essay": "In my opinion, the two solutions both have its pros and cons. But I think the first solution which is, create housing areas by providing taller buildings, is a better solution. Providing taller buildings can save the area of lands being use and can create more areas with green grass or trees that can help the environment. Also taller buildings can provide greater view and can be designed in creative ways. So does the buildings in cities can create a skyline which makes the city scenario more modern and breathtaking. On the other hand, if we choose to build houses on a wider area, the land will still, be eventually out of use. And they are likely to destroy wildlife or nature areas since places that has wide areas are mostly at the rural parts of the country. Also, houses wide spread in a large area can be crowded and can seem messy and not ideal for site. Although maybe some people will think that shorter buildings are safer when there is a fire or when natural disasters like earthquake comes, but the number of times these problems occur are low and modern technology can also help to lower the risk of people getting hurt. In conclusion, I think create housing areas by providing taller buildings is a better solution because it solves the fundamental problem which is not having enough places for people to live by not using new lands and can also creates less harm for the nature, which is significantly important.",

    "essay": "I strongly agree with this statement. If women and men are both working full time, they should share household works.\nFirst of all, if women and men are working full time, and they are working in the same amount of time, logically, the amount of time they do household works should be the sam e. However, if one of them work for longer hours, the household works should still be shared but the other one should do more household works.\nSecond of all, everyone have responsibility to do household works because everyone lives in the house, makes the house dirty, creates dirty clothes and dishes. If there is only either women or men doing household works, it is not fair at all, because they both work full time.\nBut as I mentioned before, the amount of time doing household works can be arranged, it doesn't have to be evenly shared. For instance, if the woman in this family work for longer hours or got an extra call by work, the man should help and do her part of household works. And when the man are working more, the woman should do the same. This does not only solve the problem of who should do household works but can also show that women and men are supporting each other in various situations.\nIn conclusion, when women and men are both doing full time jobs, they should share household works.

In this way, the house can be more peaceful and have more harmony without arguments about who should do the household works.",

    "essay": "It is becoming a trend now that husbands and wives should handle the household works together since both members of the family are working full time. In my opinion, it is convincing that the house tasks should be equally spread between both genders for the following reasons.\nIn many developing countries, people are required to work more than before; as a result, both genders are having busy lives nowadays and cannot handle the works of the house by only one of them. If the chores are being handled by both men and women, it increases the other partner's satisfaction and shows responsibilty. For instance, if a wife has several tasks in the kitchen to finish before heading to work and her husband helped their children to get ready for school, this emotionally affects the wife and she will eventually feel gratification.\nSecondly, as technology evolves, people are having a hard time to manage the tasks of their homes and might eventually hire a nanny to take care of the children and home. As a result, children would feel loneliness in addition to being ignored by their parents. Although it is not easy to manage the work life and family at the same time, giving priority to one before the other can be counter-productive. Finally, as both partners work together to handle household work, it will eventually lead to a balanced life, their daily schedules will be organised; moreover, they will have more time to spend with their children thus, the home will not have problems as long as the mother and the father are working together to manage their home.\nBy way of conclusion, I would like to re-affirm there is a vital role for both males and females in order to keep their homes well balanced. Despite having a full employement job for both of them, it is necessary to share the works of their home together.",

Personally, I strongly consent the view due to the fact that none of them is superior to other. This essay will explore the foremost motives reflecting this and provide evidence to prove the arguments.\nThere are manifold reasons for home activities division. First and foremost, equality of gender. In modern socities either Ladies nor Men is better than other. For this reason, once both are integral workers, they should divide domestic activities. Moreover, the one who come first at home should task without any prejudice. Let's take the couple Ronaldo, although they are famous one as well as wealthy personalities, they help each other in meals cooking. Hence, the couple is happy and stable.\nOther reason for household sharing activities is in light of women empowering. In the contemporary times, mandams should be treated equally as Sirs so that society could be free of chauvinism. For instance, in a number of African regions girls still regarded as inferior by their husbands. As a result, human rights are constantly violated which undoubtedly undermine their live's style and personality.\nIn conclusion, couple of genders should obviously share the household occupations because both have the same rights as well as occupations. Therefore, I strongly agree with the stand that both can do the dishes without any hesitation. Furthermore, they should make a week blueprint to the best duties management.",

    "essay": "In many parts of the world, both men and women are full-time employees, which has led to the trend of shared household chores for both genders. In my opinion, this shift should be encouraged to reduce inequality issues while it also benefits family relationship.\nFirst, sharing housework is reasonable because it will enhance gender equality, which is a worrying problem in many societies. In the past, it was widely believed that women were solely responsible for household works since women have the distinctive characteristics of care and neatness. This has resulted in many women in many countries, particularly in Asia, under pressure and engendering a sense of resentment regarding overwhelming housework. If such jobs are shared to men, it is highly that such burdens are minimised, thus being treated more fairly.\nAnother compelling reason for having both males and females engaging in doing household chores is the reduction in a family dispute. If such duties are mainly done by only men or women, the other tends to feel overwhelmed, which might, in turn, lead to domestic argument and violence. A clear explanation is a higher rate of divorce in America, which is caused by the unnecessary argument made by young adult couples.\nIn conclusion, while more men and women seem to work full-time nowadays, it is advisable that they both should take responsibility for doing housework. I agree with this as believe that It is fair and will help minimise arguments among family members, leading to an equality society and a healthy family unit.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, many businesses have to compete each other in order to survive from the rapidly changing world, leading to the high amount of time that employees spend on working. There are also other reasons why the employees work for a long period which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that spending most of our time at work is the negative development.\nIt is the fact that people have various rationales to work for long hours. A classic example is the dynamic working condition. There are many companies that provide services such as consultation to customers, meaning that if their service does not completely satisfy the clientsÃ¢ÂÂ need, such client may decide to use the service from other competitors. Hence, the employees are required to dedicate their time to deliver the best service to the clients. Another common criticism is a bright career path. When the employees work for a long period, they can carefully check their works and, as a result, delivery the works with less mistakes. Doing this way could impress their manager and they are likely to get promotion in return.\nWith a careful consideration regarding the consequence of working for long hours, there are many vital drawbacks. An obvious effect is the increase in illness. People who work very hard have to spend a lot of their time at work. Therefore, they may not have enough time to do exercises, weakening the immune system of their body. Furthermore, with the rise in the amount of working hours, people tend to lack social skills. This is because they may not be able to manage time to join social events or meet their friends, resulting in the less ability to adapt to new environments.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that people work for long hours because of the requirement in business and personal career goal which, in my opinion, leads to negative development for themselves. This is because this behavior negatively affects their health condition and social competency which are the two most important aspects in our life.",

    "essay": "In some countries, including Japan, people tend to spend long hours at work. In recent years, this issue is often discussed around Japan. Although some Japanese people take it positively, I strongly oppose this idea and believe it is no longer positive development now. I would like to state some reasons with some examples in Japanese society.\nFirstly, the Japanese economy used to be the worst poverty country around the world after world war two. Many buildings and companies were devastated, therefore, Japanese people stucked together on how to recover the damage and improve their economy. As a result, the Japanese economy has drastically and steadily developed. As a result, the Japanese economy was about to be the wealthiest country by 1980. In these periods from 1950 to 1990, the longer people work, the more money returned to employees. In addition, it was traditionally believed for Japanese people that it is virtue to work long hours in Japanese society.\nBut the economic bubble suddenly exploded in 1992, Japanese economy suddenly declined and economic growth still remains the same in 2022. Sadly, working long hours is not necessarily connected to companies profit. Although it is because of economic recession, companies still believed that it is important to work hours will result in increase company's profit. As a result, some people became workaholics and the number of people who are suffering from mental depression. Currently, Japan is one of the highest suicide rates in developed countries.\nFinally, in my opinion, the most important point is how productive systems companies and organizations need to create. For example, many companies tend to rely on too much tasks for employees who have better skills or positions than other employees. Therefore, they need to provide some curriculums about specific skills in IT, language, and accountant. If each employee upskilled their ability, it would be able to divide and conquer the tasks more efficiently. In addition, it must be more effective to adopt intern-ship work opportunities for university students. This means that those who already have work experience beforehand will cause to reduce their training time.\nIn conclusion, Japanese society is suffering from depopulation, too. This means that Japanese people are required to work with less volume workforce. Therefore, companies and the government need to consider how to work efficiently and reduce too much tasks in one employee. I believe Japanese people will be able to resolve this problem, because they are so diligent and made many success to make a countermeasure by a long history.",

    "essay": "It is often the arguement and debate of the main reasons for why employees spend longer hours at their jobs and what are the consequences of it. This essay will argue this statement, provide top reasons and main outcomes of doing so and give some relevant examples.\nThere are several reasons why workers tend to spend too much time at their jobs, beyond the work hours stated in the contracts. One reason could be that those employees have recently joined the company and they want to leave a good impression on their supervisors during the three-month probation period. Another factor is related to the many various tasks and projects given all at once, hence they get stressed out as they're restricted with the deadlines. On the other hand, some are just staying at work for a prolonged period is for the sake of self-development, e.g. studying for some certification programs, online master degree, etc.\nWhen it comes to the consequences, it can be either positive or negative, depending on the reason itself. If it is self-development then it is a good thing. In contrast, if this keeps repeating everyday then it is unhealthy for both the body and the mentality. Also, it can affect the social life and a marriage relationship. As an illustration, some countries (such as Dubai) have reduced the work hours and the outcome of this study was found satisfactory, i.g. the employees have become more productive, fruitful, and the quality of their inputs drastically improved.\nTo sum up, the best and optimal choice is to balance between the social life and the time spent at work. If we constantly adopt such habit this will affect our health (physically and mentally) and as a result the contribution and performance will deteriorate and the required job won't be done at a satisfactory level.",

This development would have negative connotations, if people would not have a work-life balance and gradually affect their health.\nNumerous workers have sometimes oblige to stay at work longer. Firstly, there are huge companies that need more workforce and time to keep up with work requirements. As an individual worker, sometimes requires to extend their work hours to finish the workload and assigned tasks. In most shipping companies or factories in the Philippines, for instance, there often have an outrageous number of workload to be done therefore multitude employees have been tied up to work and forced to render overtime. Secondly, nowadays people are facing in large of debts and bills. In Canada, the cost of living is quite high and unaffordable for some, so that several people work double jobs or often do overtime to earn extra more.\nSpending too much hours working has two possible drawbacks, an absence or lack of work-life balance and acquiring diseases in the long run. For married people, family time is significantly valuable in order to maintain a good family bond. Workaholic people have the tendency to negelct the importance of family bonding and tend to experience health problems thereafter. According to one research in the US, found that the number of workaholic people was tripled from 10 million to about 30 million in over a decade and majority of these people suffered from stress- related diseases such as depression, heart disease and chronic back pain.\nTo conclude, most people have spent longer time working due to extreme work demands and personal financial challenges.

Although there are some benefits to spend money for space exploration, I believe the money should be spent for a disparity of wealth and environment.\nInitially, developing the technology for space exploration is necessary to some extent. For example, if people found a drastically innovative resource on another planet that takes the place of current resources, specifically, fossil fuel, and wood.\nPeople do not need to take care of limited resources on the earth any more. In addition, improving technology will cause to people's convenience on earth as a result. For example, recently some scientists are planning to launch a space rocket as a transport system on earth. hat it takes only two hours between New York and Shanghai by rocket.\nOn the other hand, there are a lot of problems on earth. Especially, in developing countries, people are suffering from poverty while in developed countries waste massive food. In addition, even in developed countries, the disparity of wealth has been widening. Therefore, the money which is spent on space exploration should be used for all people's lives more safely around the world. Developed countries must have many options to give a hand to developing countries. For example, it must be effective to provide infrastructure, agriculture, and sharing clothing and food that are about to dispose of in developed countries.\nFinally, including my opinion, people can not choose their own nationality. This means that people who were born in a developing country and need to be suffered from poverty are definitely unfair. Therefore, the money is spent on space exploration partially spend for developing countries. As a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider and people will be able to live with the same quality of lifestyle as developed countries to some extent.",

In addition, the fast technology evolution in the present came from the concerns of many scientists around the world. Some people believe that focusing on the space evolution matter. While others argue that they should invest inside the country. In my opinion, the exploration of our planet could enhance people's lives in many different ways. However, the human organization should do the best in other more useful sectors to improve human needs.\nOn one hand, the space exploration has always been a fascinating topic over recent years. Scientists researching to find out and trying to know what is hiding out of the black hole and another universal plant if it is livable or has any natural resources. For example, in 1991 research proved that to travel from the earth to the nearest planet it could take approximately 3 to 4 months continually. In other words, exploration of a planet is costly as well as takes much time to reach it.\nOn the other hand, the benefit of universe exploration may change our earth's environment and improve our lives for the next coming generation in technology. For instance, people after the year 2000 had better communication with each other which was not even possible at any time ever. Moreover, the government invests to develop space exploration companies.\nIn conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view I strongly believe that space companies such as SpaceX must try to find a new resources to visit other planets.

Due to this curiosity, the amount of resources and money invested in its exploration is surprisingly big. Developing technology for it is expensive but, in my humble opinion, completly justified.\nFirstly, developing technology is vital so that space exploration can be carried out succesfully. Experts have discovered that we only know a 4 percent of the entire universe. If with only that 4 percent we have accomplished amazing achievements, imagine what the human race could do when knowing a 10 percent.\nSecondly, space exploration and the technology involve on it not only will help the human race understand the universe but also will provide a whole new kind of tourism, space tourism. The CEOs of some of the most profitable business in America are investigating this possibility. The leading enterprises in this sector are Blue Origin from Jeff Bezos and Space X from Elon Musk. When discovered the way of sending people to space safely, space tourism will generate twice the money spent on technology for space exploration.\nIn a nutshell, space exploration is crutial for the development of the human race. Furthermore, if this was not enough, all the technology developed will serve the purpose of creating a whole new kind of tourism that will generate billions of dollars in revenue.

    "essay": "Some governments budget a considerable amount of expenditure on space exaploration, yet many opponents voice their opinion that it is meaningless to financially support this aspect, and this money should be alternatively allotted on other more important priorities. My firm conviction is that it is rewarding to pour money into exploring outer space since it might produce long-term benefits.\nFrom a short-term pespective, there are seemingly compelling reasons to exclude space exploration from the national budget. The result of exploring the exterrestrial space is unpredictable. If research fails, it would be a loss of financial resources considering the huge cost. Besides, compared with space exploration, education inequality, health care problems and underdeveloped infrastuctures are more urgent issues, meaning that money spent on these facets may produce immediate benefits for people's quality of life.\nHowever, I firmly believe we should hold a long-term perspective and figure out potential merits brought about by exploring and researching the outer space. First of all, environmental problems, such as global warming and water shortage, are gradually worsening and threatening people's health to a large extent. Allocating financial resources on space exploration could further investigate and prove whether there are life forms or natural resources on another planet, which might provide a soultion to those long-exisiting environmental issues. Also, many exisiting technologies closely associated with the daily life of mainkind, such as weather forcast and earthquake anticipation, are also highly reliant on the space technology. This will allow humans to take necessary precautions in the face of some urgent situations.\nTo summarize, I believe space exploration is a long-term solution to many existing problems on this planet, and thus deserve adaquate government expenditure.",

    "essay": "For years, space has fascinated humans. The idea that there could be life on other planets, as well as the challenge of exploring as much of the universe as possible, has been one that has excited everyone from top physicists, to the youngest child playing with her space ship toys. But is the money spent on exploration of the universe justified or should it rather be allocated to helping those on this planet? I believe that space exploration is justified. In this essay, the motivation for space exploration will be explored.\nPlanet Earth is ill. Humans have polluted the planet and destroying natural resources. Some might argue that the damage is irreparable. Global warming is causing the Earth's temperature to steadily rise. There is a possibility that in the next few centuries, the planet may become inhabitable. Scientists like Elon Musk have recognised the dire situation that the Earth is in, and have started looking for an alternative new home planet. It is possible that in the coming years, there will be no other option than to move to a planet like Mars. Therefore, the costs involved in exploring this planet are justified, if it is to house the entire human race.\nSpace exploration also allows for new discoveries. New minerals or compounds could be discovered on distant planets. These could possibly be used on Earth in various new technologies, or even in medical science to treat illness or disease. This could be invaluable to humankind.\nSince the dawn of the human race, a characteristic that separates us from our animal relatives, is our ability to tinker with existing knowledge, as well as learn new things. It has lead to humans becoming the dominant force on the planet. New ideas prevent us from becoming stagnant, thus driving progress. If we continue to learn new things from space exploration, we prevent stagnation.\nLastly, the idea that there could be life on other planets is one that has merit, in my opinion. Humans cannot be so arrogant to think that there is no other life in the universe.\nIn conclusion, it can be argued that space exploration does not hold merit and should be discontinued. But the benefits that it offers outweigh the shortcomings.",

    "essay": "Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. In this essay, the reason for wasting food and the acts which can be done by humans to reduce the amount of food one throws away will be thorougly discussed.\nFirstly, people waste food as one tends to be satisfied with the amount one eats. Thus, people order food more than one can eat as one can not estimate the amount of food. The amount of food one person can consume differs on one's conditions at that moment. The conditions include mood, physical features and activities one did on that particular day. Furthermore, one wants to taste all sorts of food, however, one can not eat all of those. Sometimes, people order food which are well decorated just to take a photo of it and upload it on social media such as Instagram. After taking photo, people just leave the food. The above mentioned reasons can be the causes of wastage of food.\nApparently, people can reduce the amount of food they throw away. The restaurants can provide more informations about the amount and taste briefly to avoid the situation that consumers can not finish the food and are dissatisfied with the taste or smell. Moreover, consumers have to make a wise decision so that they do not waste both food and money. People should co-operate to reduce the wastage of food as it causes pollution on land. It leads to bad smell and brings insects to the areas.\nConclusively, it is quite clear that people greatly waste food and there are a few ways for people to follow so as to reduce the amount of waste food.",

    "prompt": "People think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.",
    "essay": "It is undeniable that crime inevitably contributes to negative consequences to society, which affects in various aspects. Hence, there is a belief that giving longer prison sentences could be the most effective way to reduce the crime rate. Nevertheless, there are also opponents who believe that other effective mitigations are also available which I personally agree with.\nIt is true that being sentenced for a very long period is what people do not want to experience. A criticism in favor of this is that those who live in prison will lack freedom. This is because prisoners will be forced to stay in jail only, meaning that they could not meet their companions as well as traveling to another country until the end of the prison term. Another common example which supports the idea of increasing the sentence term is that prisoners will be under control by authorities all time. Living in this condition would possibly result in the loss of privacy, which is the experience that people tend to avoid.\nIn spite of the fact that giving longer sentences seems to be effective, other solutions could also be applied. A classic example is that people who break the laws must pay an extremely high penalty to governments. Since people do not want to lose their money, this policy is likely to encourage people to follow the laws, leading to the declining number of crime. Another potential solution could be done by schools to teach young generations about the effects of crime. Once students understand that committing crime would lead to the lower standard of living of people in communities such as reducing in the neighbors' safety, they tend to behave in the opposite way which is to improve the living conditions of other people instead and this would have hugely positive impacts in the long term.\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that being in prison for a long time is a completely terrible experience for people because of no flexibility and privacy in life, it seems to me that other alternatives which are paying higher fines and educating young people with respect to negative effects of crime tend to be more effective. This is because these solutions are likely to address the root cause of committing crime and tend to be more applicable in the long run.",

    "essay": "The topic of whether giving longer prison sentences lead to a decrease in the rate of crime or some other alternative solutions might be helpful to reduce the rate of crime. Although it depends on each country's crime rate and cost, I believe some alternative solutions will be realistic for reducing crime.\nFirst of all, some people believe giving a long sentence will be not only a safe solution, but also useful to pay an attention to other people not to commit a crime. They state that this is the best way in terms of cost, and the organization well systemized. They believe the crime rate will go down as a result.\nOn the other hand, some people oppose the system. The longer prison sentences have an influence to some extent. But for the victims and their families can not be convinced, and if alternative systems are well organized, some crimes might be prevented in advance. Therefore, it must be necessary to deploy the military or police in a specific area where crimes often occur. This is effective to inhibit the crime rate.\nFinally, crimes, criminals often sporadically emerge, even if the government stipulates the law which serves long prison sentences. This is ubiquitous around the world. Therefore, the most important point is how people need to become aware of dangerous situations and avoid not being involved. In addition, governments need to delegate stronger authority to the police and military to patrol around the specific area twenty-four seven, as comparatively higher crimes occur in the town. This might be costly, but it is worthwhile to configure a safe society.",

    "essay": "Some people share the view, that for minimising criminality offenders should go to jail for a long time while others are of the view, that this problem should be tackled by using alternatives solutions. I believe, that the judicial system should look for other ways to punish criminals depending on the severity of the offence.\nFirstly, by keeping people encarcelated for years, 'the problem is locked up' and there is no need to dealt with it until the sentence is served. For instance, for individuals who have committed a serious crime such as murder, a long sentence is appropriate due to the severity of it and the criminal's possible danger for the society. On the contrary, for little criminals, like robbery, mild sentences or social hours should be considered as an option.\nOn the other hand, by trying to get these individuals before they commit a severe crime, could be a clever step. For example, in Switzerland, social workers work very hard to get, mostly youngster, an apprenticeship. So, they are kept busy and usually happy. By placing people to jail for a long time, they loose the contact to the outside world. Therefore, trying to keep them outside doing the activities they were doing before the crime, would be a reasonable. In other words, these citizens could wear electronically sensors, so that the judicial services can check on them. That would be a win-win situation for the government, society due to the lower cost compared to the jail expenses and for the individual who can continuing with his/her life.\nIn brief, despite some circumstances for jailing an individual, I believe, that alternative ways of punishment should always be on option depending on the degree of the crime.",

    "prompt": "In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?",
    "essay": "According to COVID-19 event forced many company to change their way of working. One of the most significant transformation is the communication. The online communication becomes a must or inevitable for the company to be implemented. In this topic, we're going to disscuss the advantages and disadvantages for both ways of communications. The online meeting can introduce a significant impact to the organization while face to face meeting can be outdated for this new era of 2021.\nFirst of all for the online communication's advantages is that in the pandemic period the actual physical contact is a significant way to transmit the disease. Video conference can help mitigate this problem by lower the physical contact for each conversation or meeting. Also communicates through online channel can help individual to organize or manage their time efficiently according to each person preference. For example, a single mom parent may be able to spend times for her sons/daughters at home, while be able to have a cross country meeting with another department in other region. Another reason is that some people are quite introvert and find it difficult for face to face human interactions or conversations, in which online chat or messages can help them to mitigate this problem and communicate efficiently. Lastly as mentioned about video conference across region, online meeting can help the multi-national corporates save the transporations cost and additional resources needed to spend for face to face meeting.\nFor the disadvantages, all of the online communications required hardware, internet connection and technological knowledge on how to use them. This technological gap can be seen as one of the most significant obstracle or disadvantage for people to use online communications. For example, in one company, there obviously have a various age of people, in which some of them are not familiar with the technology. Since video call conference has been introduced and utilized widespread among corporates not so long time ago. This can be a big technological gap for some people to use the online communications and result in a lost in communications among the workplaces.\nAs a result, online communication helps an organization to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease, improved the time mangement ability and productivity for each individuals, and lower the financial cost or resources required to spends for international business activities. With all these advantages of online communication stated, they can be seens as a significant reasons to outweight the disadvantages of technological gap on this current year of 2021.",

    "essay": "With new technologies come new ways to communicate with people. First, we had emails and now we have social media and a variety of different apps that give us the opportunity to chat with one another. And this kind of online communication entered not only our personal but also our professional life. This topic is rather controversial and people have different opinions about that, so in this essay, I'm gonna be talking about pros and cons of the new type of working communication.\nFirst, I would like to start with some advantages of online communication at work. In my opinion, the main thing that makes people go from meeting face to face to talk online is the fact that it's more convenient. We don't have to set a specific date to meet someone. And also we can talk to someone from wherever we want, without needing to drive to the office. The two things we need are our cellphone or computer and the internet connection. But I think nowadays it won't be a problem for anyone because the majority of people have each of this stuff.\nThe second advantage - the functionality of apps for online communication. Let's take Zoom. I think almost everyone used this app in 2020 during lockdowns all over the world, including myself. You can arrange a meeting with thousands of people, using this app. This is much easier than gathering large amounts of people in one place. You can also record this meeting if you wish and send this recording to people who were absent or use it yourself in the future to remember all the details. Face to face meetings do not provide us with all these opportunities.\nIf we talk about disadvantages, I do not see a lot of them. The only thing that we can miss in online communication is the ability to see human emotions and facial expressions. I find it really important, especially when it comes to discussing important projects or deals. From my own experience, I can say that when there was a lockdown in my country due to the pandemic, I missed physical interaction with my colleagues, such as handshaking, etc. I find physical interaction to be an effective way for team building, so it's might be hard to work without it, using only online communication.\nTo conclude, I would say that everyone can have different opinions about whether it's better to meet online or face to face. But what I am sure about is that we should not get rid of face to face meetings completely. Otherwise, It will be hard to keep the team tigh-knit.",

We stiil sit at home rather then go to a restorant with friends and a lot of companies still keep their offices locked.\nOn the one hand office workers from all over the world opened the possibility of working from home. This option gives you more freedom and diversity of places from wich you can do your job: you can meet with your collegues from cafe or library, from kitchen or bedroom. Also, we were forced to keep our social nets with online tools, to communicate with our friends and families. Now we all learned to use such programmes like Zoom or Skype to speak with each other. Probably if we hadn't the Covid, we would struggle bigger difficulties when someone from our buddies would come to another country or town, but now we all know what to do with this, how to keep in touch. We also got to appreciate the power of touching more then before, because we were missing it for these long monthes. How it was nice to hug an old friend after long quarantine!\nOn the other hand we really weaned from normal offline communication. And we can't evaluate how many people started to think that online is absolute substitute of offline. It's obviosly not like that. During online meeting it's impossible to have a normal common discussion because it needs to have only one person speaking. Also people lack of possibility to see each others eyes, so they don't feel enough contact with each other.\nAs a conclusion it is possible to say that situation with increasing popularuty of online meetings is ambivalent. This type of communication save our connections with each other during the pandemia, but there is a risk of substitution real meetings by online in the situations when it is not appropriate.

    "essay": "Education is one of the most important topics for childhood development, and music can be very beneficial to children because it helps to sustain creative thinking and improve imagination. Some educators demand that music should be taught as a mandatory subject, and yet some others think that forcing children to play music instruments will limit their chances to discover and develop other talents.\nIndeed, music can be a great source for improving the lives of many children as well as their learning experience. Learning music instruments requires patience, creativity and good discipline. Inherently, in order to master a music instrument, a good musician needs to sharpen his preserverence and offer all his best, for a great performance often demands ten or more years of practice. The heart of a musician, the pursuation of perfection and persistence are all good qualities for a child to learn throughout his life in pursuing his career, not only the career in music.\nHowever, despite all the good qualities that can be obtained through playing music instruments, childhood education can be misdirected if the development of a hobbie becomes \"mandatory\", which, of ocurse, includes music instruments. It might be beneficial for a child to experiment music instruments in his early years, but not every child has the potential of being a professional musician. Making music a mandatory subject for primary and secondary school students could minimize their opportunities to discover different hobbies. Moreover, making a bobbie a mandatory subject may also hinder the other learning experiences of a young child. Just imagine how stressful it is to study an unecessary subject on top of regular courses and other homework. It does more harms than goods to the overall learning experience.\nIn conclusion, it might be beneficial for a child to learn music instruments in his first school years, but if he does not have the talent and does not enjoy music, educators should consider dropping such suggestion and let him discover other hobbies.",

However, I disagree that this skill is essential to every pupil.\nFirst of all, not all people are born with a talent for music, which is essential if one wants to learn how to play it. Some people are natural musicians and succeed in this sphere with ease. On the other hand, there are children for whom learning to play is a hard work and, eventually, they might start hating music instead of enjoying it. Some people are bound to become excellent engineers or doctors and for them learning to read and play music is just a waste of time.\nAnother important factor is that all kids are different and for that reason each of them desires to have a different hobby. If all pupils spent time on music, those who are not interested in it would have less time on things that are really exciting for them. Undoubtedly, everybody has a right to spend their free time in the way they want.\nWhat is more, playing a musical instrument is not considered to be an essential skill for a successful career. More time should be devoted to more important subjects, such as Math, Science and Languages. These have more chance to be useful for people when they grow up and graduate from school.\nTo sum up, teaching all children to play an instrument wouldn't be a good idea. It should be taught only to those who really want it as not only would it ditract a child from subjects and hobbies which are more important in their opinion, but also it cannot be mastered by everybody.",

    "essay": "There are opposite views as to which stage of life would exert the most influence on a child's life. Some people hold that the pre-school life is the most influential, while others disagree and claim that the teenage life, notably the period of staying at school, would be more important to his/her life. This essay is to evaluate both views and demonstrate my opinion.\nBefore entering the school, children usually receive the most influence from their parents and friends. At home, children would spend much time with their parents teaching them a variety of knowledge needed to help an adolescent act properly and get recognised by the society in the future. When staying outside, children would also be influenced by their friends or other peers since children tend to resemble the behaviours of their peers in order to integrate into the social group of adolescents.\nIn the school life, a child's personality would be shaped both by classmates who frequently interact with the child and potentially affect the child, and by teachers presenting knowledge in various fields of science and liberal arts so as to help the child obtain a basic understanding to the world.\nAs far as I am concerned, it is rather arbitrary to conclude which period of life would be more important than the other, since a child's psychological development is too complex to be understood. After all, the importance of pre-school life or teenage period might vary from one child to another. Children have their respective understandings as to which person deserves their admiration and which period of life teaches them the best lesson.\nTo sum up, children would be influenced by different persons in different periods of life. It depends on children's own intention as to which period is more pivotal, and which person should be admired.",

    "essay": "The experiences a child goes through during different stages of life defines his personality and have great impact on his future. Some people argue that those experiences which a child faces before entering into school has more effect, whereas others believe that teenhood has profound influence on a child's future life. This essay will discuss in detail both the views and explain why i believe that both early childhood and teenage experiences decide what future holds for the child.\nThose people, who are in opinion that experiences in early childhood before the start of school has impact on future life, give several reasons. They believe that whatever a child faces at home helps in shaping his personality. For example, abusive childhood greatly has long lasting effect on their lives. It has been studied that those children who are victims of child abuse are more likely to become criminals. Some of them can never return towards normal life. Moreover, parents by their care and love can raise a child with a bright future. These children know the world from the perspective of their parents and it helps them to become a well-mannered and cultured human being with specific life goals, such as getting higher education or finding a job. In short, early childhood has its far reaching effects on a child.\nOn the other hand, people, who think that teenage experiences , especially at school, have more impact on determining the future of the person, have their own reasons to support their argument. Firstly, it is the phase of life where hormonal changes are taking place and they are experiencing body changes both mentally and physically; therefore, those who can have control on their emotions during this phase can develop as a strong individual. Secondly, it is the phase where most of the teenagers start taking decisions about their future study choices and any study experience at school help them in making these decisions. Such resolutions in teenage can have impact on their future practical lives. Finally, those youngsters, who are bullied during their teenhood at school, can suffer from personality disorder later in their lives which can have detrimental affect on their future. Surely, these experiences in teenage can affect a child's future.\nTo conclude, i believe that both pre-school childhood and teenage experiences help shape the future of a person. It is the experiences in both of these phases of lives which influence a child's future.",

    "essay": "It is important to experiance and learn certian kind of habits at younge age for children to develop them as they grow older. Growing vegetables and taking care of animals are two main practices children should develop at their younger age. In this essay I will discuss some disadvatages that would affect children during this process and explain why I feel that there are better advatages.\nThe most significant advatage of learning to grow vegetables is that children will initally start to understand the importance of eating healthy and also the process of growing vegetables. In this case children will learn not to waste food and how hard and the effort it takes to grow these vegetables. It is important that we keep reminding children from their primary age so that they will remember and practice as they grow older. Taking care of animals is another important thing that children should learn in their primary , this will teach children to care for others and not be frighten of animals. Furthermore, they will learn to respect animals and love them.\nSome of the disadvantages of keeping animals is that some children has different types of allergies which will lead them to be more sick. However, some animals tend to be more dangerous than others. Another disadvatages is that when growing vegetables the compost and pestisides are dangerous to children or it might sometime be allergic to them as well. Insect bites during planting will also lead children to get sick.\nIn conclusion it is important to learn how to grow vegetables and take care of animals at their younger age since they develop certain habits and learn more indeapth which will be helpful as they grow older. Eventhough, some argue that it is more riskier for children I believe that the advatages outweight disadvatages.",

    "essay": "In primary school, especially in the countryside in Japan, primary students have an opportunity to learn how to plant and grow vegetables. In addition, students need to feed and observe animal growth and health. This is a great advantage for children to enrich their knowledge of how essential our lives consist in society. It is obviously advantageous than disadvantages.\nFirstly, the procedures to grow vegetables take a long time from cultivating the soil to harvesting vegetables when they grew up. This means that it is great education for children on how to produce our food and agriculture industries have been paying an outstanding effort and time. This education causes students to become aware of the necessity of gratitude to people who are working in these industries.\nIn addition, it is also mandatory to keep animals in a good condition is worthwhile as young as possible. Animals also have lives, and their lives easily devastate unless they are fed. This is also the same in human lives. Young children will be able to recognize how sensitive to keeping animals a good condition, and be more respectful to their own parents and how deep love they give to children. As a result they are more willing to give a hand who need help.\nFinally, these activities, such as growing vegetables and keeping animals are not only helpful to learn what our society consists of, but also more educational for children firsthand, instead of watching documental TV programs. Through these activities, children will become aware of current issues, for example, food consumerism, extinction of animal species, global warming, and so on. If they learned as young as possible, the number of people who are concerned and make specific actions for these issues will increase. As a result, our lifestyle will improve more peacefully.\nÃ¥ÂÂÃ§ÂÂ©Ã£ÂÂÃ§Â¹ÂÃ§Â´Â°Ã£ÂÂ«Ã§ÂÂ¶Ã¦Â³ÂÃ£ÂÂÃ¨Â¦Â³Ã¥Â¯ÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂ¦Ã£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂ³Ã£ÂÂ³Ã£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂ£Ã£ÂÂ·Ã£ÂÂ§Ã£ÂÂ³Ã£ÂÂÃ¤Â¿ÂÃ£ÂÂ¤Ã£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂ¨Ã£ÂÂ®Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¥ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ§ÂÂ¥Ã£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂ¯Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ£ÂÂ«Ã£ÂÂÃ¥ÂÂ±Ã©ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂ¦Ã£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ¨Â©Â±Ã£ÂÂÃ©ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂ¦Ã¨Â¦ÂªÃ£ÂÂ«Ã¥Â¯Â¾Ã£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ¦ÂÂÃ¨Â¬ÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ¥ÂÂÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ£ÂÂ«Ã¥Â¯Â¾Ã£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂ¦Ã¦ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ¨Â¨ÂÃ¨ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂ¨Ã£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂ§Ã£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂ«Ã£ÂÂªÃ£ÂÂÃ£ÂÂ",

    "essay": "Some people believe that young children ought to breed animals and plant vegetables. This essay will argue about some pros and cons of children working as farmers, and also show that disadvantages overtake the benefits of it.\nOne the one hand, it is a fact that young children who work looking after animals and plants learn how to respect the environment and develop an elevated sense of responsability. Certainly, activities such as taking care of animals and grow vegetables favour children in many aspects of their lives, like to have a better health, mostly because of doing lots of outdoor activities and eating healthier food than city children.\nOn the other hand, if children learn how to work as a farmer, they could try to do it alone, without any supervision, which is surely a hard work, with a lot of difficult and responsabilties. In order words, those tasks could be dangerous to a child and affect negatively its live. For example, it is necessary to use some special tools to deal with vegetables, and those tools could harm easily a child. In addition, looking after animals and plants take too much time and children must spend their time studying and having fun instead of working.\nIn conclusion, although the benefits that people can find in teaching young children to deal with animals and grow vegetables, the disadvantanges of children doing those tasks are extremely high, because of some permanent damages which could be caused by dangerous tools. In my opinion, young children should learn how to do it but they must not do those activities even if they were supervised by adults.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, it is widely believed that education has become an important aspect of our lives, especially for primary children, which have to be well educated before achieving the period of adolescence. Furthermore, I hold on firmly to the belief that, children should learn how to respect the environment, especially the agriculture such as vegetables and the wildlife as animals.\nTo begin with, children should learn how to cultivate and grow vegetables, in order to respect the environment. In other words, children may experience some extra activities related to plants cultivation during or after school. For instance, educational institutions could organise some apprenticeship activities and teach how to cultivate and grow vegetables. In addition to this, it often claimed that taking part in these types of activities may develop children's skills and acquiring leadership skills. Moreover, young students could experience different types of cultivation, in order to gain knowledge of agriculture sector. Therefore, these may be useful for children's career prospects and for their future.\nSecondly, another vital aspect of our world that should be considered is the wildlife, especially there some animals endangered. In other words, animals have become significant for the world's ecosystems and useful for companionship. For example, it is generally agreed that children may have to learn how to maintain animals. Additionally, children could experience activities in animals protection associations, in order to learn how to keep and protect animals with the support of some volunteers. As a result, children when they grow up are aware to the fact that animals are important and have to be always appreciated and respected.\nIn conclusion, as far as I'm concerned, the advantages of learning how to cultivate vegetables and keep animals definitely outweigh the drawbacks. Additionally, there is no doubt that children doing these activities may gain many positive experiences, develop their skills and learn how value and appreciate the environment including wildlife.",

    "essay": "It is proposed that elementary schools should teach their pupils vegetable growing and animal keeping skills. Although there are controversial views towards this proposal, I believe that its benefits outweigh its drawback for a range of reasons stated below.\nOn the one hand, experiences of vegetable growning and animals keeping can help children develop some first hand knowledge and some key characters that would benefit them in the long run. Firstly, by involving in the process of vegetables growing, children gain in-depth understanding of the nature and its impact on the development of a life cycle. In this case, they are capable of learning some practiacal knowledge regarding how weather and seasons could either foster or destruct the growth of plants. Secondly, keeping pets or other animals can encourage the deveopment of the pupils' responsibility. As they learn how to rountinely feed animals, and take showers for them, their responsbility and empathy also grow hand in hand, which would lay a solid foundation for their future study, family life and professional career.\nOn the other hand, it may be argued that taking such courses could distact students from their intensive study. It is not necessarily true because the aforementioned knwledge and skills can be transferble to their academic study and social life in schools. For example, their first hand experiences of growing vegetables can advance their understanding of some theoretical knowledge about plants in the bilogy class. The empathy deveoped through raising animlas could be also taken advantage to strengthen relationships with teachers and peers.\nIn conclusion, it is understandable that some people oppose the idea of the pupils learning vegetables growing and animals keeping, but I strongly think that its advantages outweigh the disadvantages.",

    "essay": "It is advised that toddlers should learn about growing vegetables and raising animals. Although there are downsides to this proposal, the overall advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages in this matter.\nThe main advantage of teaching the younger generation how to farm vegetables and keeping animals is that it can enhance their understanding of the environment. There is no doubt that school kids could learn about the environment on books, but the most effective way is to interact with the habitation of vegetables and animals as they can easily be related with. In addition, by learning about foods and animals, children could quickly develop their awareness of not wasting food. Only when children realize how difficult and complicated it is to nurture food, can they stop wasting food or throwing food they dislike. For instance, public schools in Melbourne developed a targeted curriculum to supporting primary children to learn about the growth of foods and the significance of preserving the environment and reduce food waste. Hence, the advantage is obvious since younger pupils must recognise the world they live in.\nHowever, it is suggested that the physical risk of allowing primary offspring to learn about farming could not be overlooked. One of the root disadvantages of caring for animals is the safety issue as animals might have potentially harmful effects on young kids. To elaborate, there is a mixture of the hidden virus on animals' bodies, due to the fragility of children's immune systems, they are too vulnerable to defend against external viruses, not to even mention the physical attack from animals to children. According to the agricultural department, there are 300 cases of animals attacking children reported every year in China, which could be considered as a piece of strong evidence of the disadvantages.\nIn conclusion, despite the potential drawbacks of learning about animals and floras, the benefits of involving young toddlers in discovering about the environment still outweigh the downside.",

Recently, it has been suggested that kids in elementary schools should also take part in such occupations. In this essay, I will count possible advantages as well as some disadvantages of such a change in life, in order to conclude whether or not it is a cost effective notion.\nIt is commonly believed that the enviroment has been endangered by imminent risks. Some people speculate that humans have been less connected to nature and therefore are not aware of the detrimental effects of their activities on the environment. Thus, teaching children how to raise up vegetables and how to get along with pets can probably strengthen bonds between children and nature in early phases of life. Furthermore, If children grew plants in early stage of life, they would develop unique creative skills alongside enhancing their productivity. Moreover, some experts claim that treating animals may benefit children as it would improve their social and communicational skills.\nOn the other hand, there is another aspect which merits futher consideration. Some plants are known to be poisonous and unsafe to young people. In addition, growing plants and spending time on farms might make children prone to a few insects and reptiles which can be really dangerous. Finally, animals could be harmful if they are treated inappropriately.\nTo recapitulate, as we try to wiegh up the pros and cons of such an enterprise, I still reckon that the advantages of it outweigh the disadvantages. However, in order guarantee the possible advantages I have mentioned upun above, certain safety measures should be taken to offset the potential risks opposed to children as they are in proximity to plants and animals.",

    "essay": "Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children's development than playing computer games. This essay will elaborate a point of agreement to the above statement.\nTo commence with the first reason, outdoor activities are good for children's health. As children run and play with ones' friends, outdoor activities will apparently relieve the stress. Furthermore, it is scientifically proven that an exercise is beneficial for all mankind as it is recommended by the doctors and scientists. For instance, doctors encourage the patients who have non-communicable diseases, known as lifestyle illnesses, to exercise more. Thus, it will prevent children from getting illnesses.\nAdditionally, spending time with one's friends will definitely help a child to build a healthy relationship with others. As a child learns universal values and realizes important aspects of life, it will greatly influence the way a child will live one's life. For example, a child can learn sportsmanship while playing sports with his or her friend.\nOn the other hand, playing computer games can lead a child to be addicted with electronic gadgets. Addiction is one of the most risky things which may put one's life into a pit. If a computer game consists of violent or aggressive contents within it, a child may get influenced. There are a great number of reports and thesis which focus on how computer games affect the children's behaviour in a negative way.\nMoreover, electrical gadgets affect one's eyesight. Nowdays, as most of people are exposed to the lights from the devices, it can be easily proven that there are more people with glasses comparing to the past. Using a computer for a short period of time is not risky, however, using a computer for a long time for certain purposes, even if it is for research work, it will affect one's eyesight badly.\nTo conclude, it is proven that outdoor activities are more beneficial than playing computer games. Therefore, communities, parents, and teachers ought to encourage children to do outdoor activities rather than ordering a child be sitted for a long time, the act which causes unhealthiness.",

Many people think outdoor activities are more useful for childrenÃ¢ÂÂs development compared with playing computer games. For me, I strongly agree with this view and wil give my reasons in the essay below.\nThe main reason that I agree with this statement is about socializing. Everyone knows that humans are social animals. That means they cannot live alone in society, especially kids. Outdoor activities can help them to talk with other people or play with other kids, including making friends. Moreover, childhood is the age of learning something new. They will learn something new all the time from us which can make them have a good attitude when they grow up. While playing games make themes lost of self-awareness for surrounding. As a result, outdoor activities teach children to be a good socializing\nAnother reason that I hold this view is about health. As I talk in the previous paragraph, childhood is the age of not only learning something new but also trying. Outdoor activities in terms of sports such as football or basketball can help not only connect with other kids but also make them healthy. Compared with playing computer inside their room which makes them diminish and hurt their eyesight. As it can be, children will have a good physical health form outdoor activities.\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree that adults should support their child with outdoor activities for the purpose of socializing and good physical health.",

    "essay": "Some groups of society are having the idea that outdoor activities are vital for children to improve their mental and physical skills rather than gaming. In my opinion, I agree that crafts and physical interaction between kids are essential for their development in all aspects. Modern technology which contains computer games may have negative effects on their overall development.\nThe reason why I believe that such activities are important is that kids are building their personalities during the first years of their life, and this building process requires them to play and interact with their peers in real-life situations which without any doubt can not be done through online games that do not offer this rich experience to them. For example, when a child faces her friends and communicates with them face to face doing some activities, she will learn from them things that will contribute to her growth in many ways.\nIn addition to that reason, outdoor activities offer authentic exposure to different situations which helps children to learn how to deal and manage their actions which will increase their awareness, on the other hand, computer games can not provide the exposure that may be needed to achieve such benefits. To illustrate, children who play outside their houses with their mates generally will give a specific and quick response to different situations in contrast with those who spend hours infront of computer screens.\nIn conclusion, outdoor activities are valuable for what they give to children, not only for their personalities to be formed and developed, but also for their understanding to multiple real-life situations.",

    "essay": "Some individuals believe that playing outside has a more positive effect on children's development rather than playing computer games. I share the idea that being involved in outdoor activities is more beneficial than playing computer games.\nActive development is the main reason for including outdoor activities in children's life. All people know that the development of children is an extremely significant part of building a personality. To do so parents should try to involve their children in exploring local insects, animals or playing different games such as football, riding bicycles, and many other. This will only expand the knowledge of children, and consequently have a positive effect on their development. This is also important to have a healthy generation in the future. Parents can join their children or they can find some friends around and also be socially active. For example, a father can teach his son how to bicycle or how to take care of plants and trees.\nThe next important reason for doing more outdoor activities for children is avoiding physical problems, which can cause computer games. Currently, a lot of people including children suffer from different side effects of a lazy lifestyle and obesity can exemplify it. To avoid problems with physical health in the future, spending a couple of hours should be recommended to all children.\nOf course, little time spent playing computer games will not hurt children, but it is important to limit it. To sum up, children should do more outdoor activities and play computer games less.",

    "essay": "Rules and laws are important for society to functioning well in right path, if people do whatever they want freely in regular life then it might lead society to malfunction. This essay will argue why I completely reckon that laws are entirely needed for uplifting of civilisation.\nThere are plethora of reasons why rules and laws have implication of lifestyles. First and foremost reason is that, crime, accidents and environment. If there are not certain rules about crime then people definitely do many criminal activities in each and every place , so other persons do not fell secure and safe. If people have freedom for whatever they want to do then , it will very dangerous for society as well as environment. Secondly, young generation could not differentiate what is right or wrong without the teaching of rules. For example, if official authorities could freely get implicated in money laundering from the national budgets and not encounter any punishment , then possible results in the political, economic and social turmoil in the country.\nMoreover, if there are no traffic rules then the situation of roads will not be imagined by anyone. The drugs are legal in countries then it is mainly effect on young generation's future and they will never know about right things. Pollution is only controlled by the Government's rules. If there are no any rules then human can not imagine the pollution level in the air.\nOn the contrary, some people think that, rules and laws are unnecessary for their rights. If people aware about, what is good or bad for society, environment and themselves then it is not issue about laws and rules. However, many persons really can not understand about rules , so the Government made for people's peace and safety. Regulation is key that perfectly handle people's life in particular manner.\nTo put in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, rules and laws are essential for the functioning of society. If citizens are given freedom to do whatever they like, then they will not only fall into bad habits but also creat confusion and nuisance in society as well as nation.",

    "essay": "To be a part of a modern society people must follow laws that are set in place by the superior authorities. Some agree that if there would be no rules, our society could not function the way it does now. This essay will argue why rules and laws are necessary for a functioning society.\nSome people have such high moral standarts, that even if there would be no rules, they would act exactly as they are with rules set in place. These people are geniunely kind and would never want to cheat ir cause harm to another person. It is not the law that makes them act this way, but rather their personality and values. This is why if everyone would be like this, no laws would be necessary, because people would act humane and want only the best for eachother.\nThe society we live in could not exist without rules and laws set in place to control it. Everyone is different and they have a different value system and understanding of what is an acceptable action and what is not. Some people believe that it is ok to steal from another, cheat or do harm to another person. Only thing that tries to keep them in place is our system law enforcement, that promises consequences if the rules are broken. For many people this is enough to live by the rules. However, even with the laws set in place, some still break them for their own benifit. If people commit crime, knowing that they can be punished for it, how many more would do harm if there would be no consequences to their action? For these reasons our world could not run without it being regulated by the system of law.\nTo conclude, even though some people naturally follow rules, it is not enough for a functioning society, because many others would feel free to do what they want to. Ultimately, our society could not function as it does now, if there would be no laws and rules to follow, and the possibility of serious consequences if those are broken.",

    "essay": "It is commonly held that society can operate perfectly by a set of rules. It means that providing total freedom to people undoubtedly results in chaos with the further possibility of total collapse. I strongly agree with this point of view as I am in the opinion that rules play a significant role in creating a stable society. In this essay, this idea will be discussed in detail.\nBasically, a set of rules can be helpful to achieve productive results in such essential areas as medicine and construction. For example, it is necessary to develop common procedures of operations in surgery or traffic rules for public transport. Unless there are not standardized, it might cause a lot of deaths or at least injuries. Constructing also should be based on common processes because comfort and safe accommodation is a necessity for many people. Although there are people who consider rules and laws limiting and imposing, it can be argued that they are critical in the organization of humanity.\nLaws are not obstacles on the way to people's freedom because they are established to regulate formal relationships when it is difficult to find a compromise informally. Moreover, they are vitally important when people face crime and violence. Without any system of justice solving crimes becomes more challenging. All criminal accidents tend to be out of control and spread around the world immediately. Shoplifting, robbery, and even disastrous wars can plunge our world into darkness. This way humanity might face total chaos where morals values and behavioral patterns are neglected. In this context, the word Ã¢ÂÂsocietyÃ¢ÂÂ risks becoming totally meaningless, as its main definition is a 'group of people with common traditions and rules.'\nFrom the arguments presented above, one may conclude that any society needs standards, laws, or even moral principles. They form a foundation for safety, a good level of medicine, and science that allows to create a strong society and manage any difficulties or threats that may disturb peopleÃ¢ÂÂs well-being.",

The huge tendency to get whatever basically required from a click of a finger is blessing for many. Such facility had enabled disabled people to get access to millions of global shopping markets with their varieties. In addition, it had proven its efficiency among the massive liquidity and momentum from overseas markets and local marketing agencies, in addition to the enormous numbers of online purchasers. For instance, getting a basic need from a grocery had become much more simple than getting to step out to the next building store. The absolute advantageous effect of this trend feature will benifit this generation, and the next, which will seem unprecedented.\nOn the other hand, despite the fact that the pros firmly outweighs the cons; they could sound quite frankly heavy to tolerate. Many dark facts of such virtual store system must be clarified. One fact is the delivery system. Late delivery could cause catastrophic consequences. Poor shipping as well is a jeopardizing negative issue. For example, One month ago, I have personally ordered from a famous well-known store in my region. The usual shipping time was stated to be form 3 - 5 days at most. With all respect. They never respected their delivery date expected, urging me to wait a period of 30 days with no exaggeration. However, other customers could have complained to the court and asked for their right, but i was much more tolerant and patient.\nA good summary suggest, that how much was this online trading circle wide , popular and efficient. There must be some dark facts and troubles that in fact, could be solved. Ultimately, I suggest that this innovation will contain the global markets dramatically, getting a long ride to a store a forgettable thing.",

    "essay": "One of the main objectives of technology is to facilitate people's lives. Nowadays, modern technology has been created to help people in several aspects of their daily lives, one of them being shopping. Some people consider that modern technology has made shopping easier, whereas, some detractors consider that these new technological gadgets have made it more difficult. I highly agree that the current technology has facilitate shopping due to the reasons explained in the following paragraphs.\nOn the one hand, technology has made shopping easier, because it saves people's money and time. Regarding shopping, new websites, such as, Amazon and Whish, as well as, applications, like Cornershop and Uber Eats, have enabled people to buy food, clothes and various goods from the confort of their homes. Thus, it is no longer necessary to travel to a shop, waste time in a queue and spend money in a parking ticket. This means that people can use the time that was spend in shopping on other activities (i.e., reading a book, doing sports, cooking, among others).\nMoreover, technology enabled a new and varied competition in the market, making it possible that small shops, which were uknown and did not have the resources to have a physical space, now can be famous known. For instance, \"Mercado Libre\" (Free Market in English) is a website that helped several sellers make their products known to the public.\nOne the other hand, some detractors may indicate that technology has made shopping today more difficult, due to the lack of interpersonal relationship between the seller and the buyer. This hindrance makes it impossible to test the product before buying it. Nowadays, several people prefer staying at home and buy what they need in the internet or in an application, not being possible to have a face to face conversation with the person that it is selling a product. However, websites and applications have reviews by the consumers of the products, therefore, people can be informed of a good before it is bought.\nIn conclusion, modern technology may imply some complications like the lack of testing a product before buying it, however, the advantages are superior, mainly, because it has make people's lives easier, saving them time and money that could be used in other activities more enriching than going shopping.",

    "essay": "Nowdays the developping of modern technologies in the trade sphere provokes a lot of discussions. Some people notice significant simplification in shopping process because of these technologies whereas the other part of society denies this influence. As far as I am concerned, shopping has definitely become easier due to invention of new payment decisions.\nOn the one hand it is really difficult to ignore the creation of new payment decisions in the last decades likewise internet acquiring or different mobile technologies like Apple Pay, Google Pay etc. The two key features of all these innovations have become, firstly, decreasing the number of steps in the payment process and absence of visualisation of your own money as well since you pay by card or by phone, not by your cash. Because of these changes now the shopping is really easier for us regarding spending our money without any possibilities for extra thoughts.\nAt the same time some people can declare that due to modernisation and development of technologies a lot of companies and factories have started to create a huge variety of goods. As a consequence, customers usually struggle with choosing of what they actually need. At this point of view it is possible to regard the modernisation not as something to make the shopping easier but as the opposite of it. To clarify, the faster development is going on, the more confused an average customer is becoming because the harder for him to choose something and buy it.\nAs for my personal opinion, I concern the progress as something that usually helps me to buy goods. To elaborate, I have never had any issues with choosing in the shopping that is why it is difficult for me to express some empathy to the people who feel uncomfortable with it.\nI can conclude thus that the question of technologies and their influence in simplification in shopping is debatable. There are some who spend their money easier then ever since the number of steps in the payment process has decreased, but there are customers who have issues and find the same process less comfortable. As for me, I am inclined to the first groop of people because I've also noticed a rised pace with that I've started to make my purchases.",

    "essay": "It is commonly argued that the fast pacing technology has helped people do shopping at the present time more easily. However, some people think online shopping is really difficult for them. This essay will consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the use of technology for shopping.\nOne disadvantage of online shopping can be mentioned is that people cannot familiarize themselves with online applications for ordering essential goods and food. In fact, the elderly are not good at technology enough to go to virtual supermarkets. Besides, those who live in remote areas are not accessible easily to technology to buy online groceries.\nDespite its disadvantage, online shopping has brought about advantages for those who are technology natives. Firstly, it can be time-saving. In fact, shoppers can order any things they need with some clicks on the items, payment method, and time of delivery. Especially in a lingering Covid-19, when social distancing measures have been effective in some places in Viet Nam, according to a survey, the number of online shoppers has been increasing day by day, and thus many applications have been into existence, developed, and thrived.\nAnother advantage of virtual shopping is that it can be life-saving to many people in a pandemic across nations. Going to supermarkets can be detrimental to buyers due to the spread of viruses and the higher risk of infection. For example, in order to buy bread for breakfast, people have to go out for it and thus may be exposed to infectious or incubated victims of Covid-19. Moreover, with preventive measures of Covid-19 containment, such as people not being allowed to go out for their essential goods, if they do not know how to make an online order, it is really difficult for them to survive during a pandemic.\nIn conclusion, the use of technology for virtual shopping is beneficial to our time-saving and life-saving matters, though it is not familiar to some people. In my opinion, thanks to its advantages, I will continue to go shopping online, though the world has gone through the Covid-19 pandemic successfully.",

    "essay": "Classical music is one of the oldest artistic samples of our history. However, the young people of the new generations do not appreciate this kind of music. I believe that governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and I will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs.\nFirst of all, the main reason behind the little interest of young people in classical music is the impact of globalization in music and arts. That is because people have the opportunity to know more about multiple things without leaving their homes. However, all this knowledge is only superficial and arts, more specifically classical music, is diminished by the big international industry of music. For instance, reggaeton music, despite the fact that its lyrics are often misogynous, is the most popular style of music these days.\nAnother reason is that children and young people have less interest in cultural matters than in the past because governments do not invest in culture and arts. In most countries, investment in culture has been drastically reduced and young people have no access to classical music concerts and much less a musical instrument that has a huge cost. Consequently, governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and the arts.\nTo summarise, this essay has examined the idea of classical music and why young people do not have an interest in this kind of music. As far as I am concerned governments should take responsibility in this matter and invest more money in culture and classical music encouraging young people to learn more about this kind of art.",

It has been a part of history.If we look at the early 1800's or at early 1900's it was always classical music that garnered most attention and had people coming into concert halls to listen to musicians.It was an integral part of music in all countries.But with the evolution of music and introduction of more genres of music like Rock,Pop and Rap we have seen the rise in music which people found more appealing and intresting.\nThis has led to classical music being viewed as boring and stagnant, this can be viewed as the primary cause in fall of the popularity of classical music.\nFor example, going to a rock and roll concert which gets people involved and also allows them an opportunity to partake in the concert, which as you could understand would appeal more to the youth as compared to a classical concert where people would just view and appreciate with minimum involvement.\nClassical music is also a skilled art that needs to be learned and honed but does not integrate any modern art. For example, Michael Jackson integrated dancing with his singing which widely appealed to the masses and encouraged youth into his concerts. So if you could see a similar integration with classical music concerts it could attract more youth towards classcial music.\nHowerver, with this discussion we cannot forget that as various genres of music have been derived from classical music and youth learning classical music with attending more classical concerts would help them achieve their future music endevors and also give them a good understanding of music.\nIn conclusion, we can say that young people should be encouraged to go to classical music concerts as it would help them understand and appreciate music in its true form.However, attracting young towards classical music will need a evolution in classical music concert structure and integrate some components from other forms which would make it blend better with present day outlook.",

    "essay": "Extreme sports, such as mountain climbing and hand-gliding, have become increasingly popular over the past several decades. Now more than ever, athletes can be paid to do these activities full-time, encouraging more aspiring athletes to enter extreme sports. In addition, the addictive nature of these activities means that participants tend to stay in the sport for the thrill. While the increased popularity can result in more accidents, it can also make the sports safer as atheletes collectively learn from past mistakes.\nWhile people have undertaken extreme activities long before the advent of television and social media, these new platforms give extreme sports the much needed sponsorship and attention. Nowadays, outlandish and dangerous acts can be televised and monetized, giving the athletes a way to make a living out of these events. Therefore, more people would feel encouraged to participate in these activities knowing that they can have a decent income. On top of the external motivation, most extreme athletes take part in these sports because they are thrilling and addicting. These atheletes chase the rush and validation that they get when doing dangerous activities. As a result, even without the external rewards, some people would still partake in these sports.\nGiven that people are motivated both internally and externally to participate in extreme sports, it is inevitable that these activities become more popular. While it is true that increased participation would result in more accidents, it would also create more lessons for future participants. In this way, these accidents and injuries would help educate future athletes on how to protect themselves. Moreoever, this increased popularity would also encourage governments to draft more safety regulations.\nIn conclusion, given that it is human nature to want to achieve feats of strength and courage, extreme sports would always be attractive for some. Because of this, there will always be people injuring themselves while pursuing these feats. Therefore, these activities would become safer the more athletes learn from past incidents.",

    "essay": "Nowadays people are tend to take risk in their lifestyle, where people live only a short lifespan. Humans in the world, in the present day do many paramount activities which are breathtaking, changing from hang-gliding to mountain climibing. In my opinion I think this is a good change for peoples lifes, under two considerable reasons, such as people get more life experiences in nature and for their physical fitness. In this essay I will ounline my opinion and provide reasons with valid examples.\nOn the one hand, human begins are under the pressure of globalisation, which leads them to get more trendy experiences from nature. Since younger generation is working towards the urban development of the world they are living in large cities full of pollution and high rising buildings. When ever they find enough spare time youngsters are trying to enjoy their lifes by climbing mountains which is hiking from the technical term. To contrast this gives them the opportunity to learn more about the outside world of cities, get more experience in mother nature. They develop their knowledge about the surroundings, such as the animals, birds and different flora and faunas. As an example one of my friends wanted to do the activity of flying which this is an human made activity, but after few findings through the internet and she seeing pictures how people enjoy hiking she decided to go on a trip to Mount Everest for climbing.\nOn the other hand, people, or the young generation have the sense that activity of flying apparatus are outdated and this is not providing then enough physical fitness to burn their calories. Due to these reasons some group of young as well as old people climb mountains to develop their well-being, mostly people such as athletes and humans who are having various diseases such as obesity, adore to do hiking.\nTo sum up, in my opinion this trend is not a bad idea for the poeple to get escaped from their busy lifestyles to enjoy the nature as well as develop their fitness rather than going to artificial equipment based buildings. In fact, every sport has their own risk, so people need to accept and beware of these risky issues and attend these activities.",

    "essay": "There is no doubt that these days student's punishment decreased in most schools. Some people believe that physical punishment is important to improve behaviour. While others totally disagree with that. In this essay, I am going to discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion.\nIn terms of people who agree with the student's punishment, they think that students need it to improve their attitude and to be good at school. To illustrate, when teachers physically punish students, Students will follow their instructions and avoid doing mistakes. In addition, other students will be carefule when they think to do any wrongs to avoid the punishment. So that will lead to seeing students who behave well and do no mistakes.\nHowever, some people believe that using corpral as a physical punishment has negative effects on the students. Firstly, students who face physical ounishment from their schools will have many psychological issues like fear, low self confidence, and isolation. Secondly, theses students will hate going to school and continuing their education in the future due to this punishment. For example, students will think of school as a scary place instead of thinking of it as an education site. So it is very normal that they are going to avoid going there.\nIn conclusion, althogh some people agree with using corporal punishment, several people have their reasons to disagree with that. I believe that using corporal punishment or any kind of punishment with students at scool nowdays is unethical practice and should be avoided since there are a lot of ways to teach students to not do the wrong things.",

    "essay": "Despite the fact that physical punishment of pupils at schools is decreasing, it is considered by many that it improves discipline. This essay completely disagrees with this view because such measures are applied to those who are unable to counterattack and it maybe the easiest way but also the most inhumane.\nFirstly, physical assault is usually applied by teachers against children who are not able to stop the violence. In other words, it is not highly probable that an adolescent will try to hurt a teenager who may stop the hitting or even push it back. Thus, kids are at higher risk because the only thing they are able to do in such cases is just try to run away. Moreover, children should understand that they earn what they deserve meaning that the level of repercussions should correspond to the seriousness of so called crime. For example, Sweden schools have publicly available the set of rules and non-physical measures that will be taken against the violators, that confirms that other methods are also effective to keep appropriate kidsÃ¢ÂÂ behaviour.\nSecondly, it is much more easier for many to maintain a discipline using the fear of corporal punishment. This means that it seems unnecessary and time-waste for grown-ups to try to apply other methods while a hectic kid may be calmed down just in few seconds using the fear of pain. Pupils may not be involved in a lesson and interrupt a teacher because they are not interested in the subject that may be caused by the fact that the teacher was not able to select appropriate technics to convey knowledge. For example, a research conducted by a US institution revealed that 90% of corporal punishments were applied to pupils who did not l listened to their teachers during a lesson.\nIn conclusion, physical violence should be discontinued in schools because mostly weak kids are in danger and they are subject for such punishments because adolescents chose the simplest way of violence and fear to better the behaviour.",

    "essay": "It is the common knowledge that the corporal punishment was used in school during the previous generations. Although it has been declined, some argue that it should be used to exceel the conduct. I personally disagree with this notion because physical punishment compromise the mental and physical well-being of students.\nIt is well-established that in the modern times educational procedures have changed hugely compared with previous decades. For instance, psychologists were not part of the school staff before the modern times. Today pupils behaviour is analysed throughout systems and complex theories in order to understand their apptitudes before to produce judgements and punishments. When in the past students were drastically hitting by educators, it repercuted in negative consequences because physical and mental traumas resulted as a product of this practice. Some pupils developed violent behaviours and others suffered from lack of confidence and self-harmed, even some of them commited suicide.\nDespite the negative evidence of corporal punishment on students, the education system implemented new methods and modalities to maintain the students bahaviour. First of all, the physical punishment was entire banned from schools, even, teachers might face legal meassures if they impart this kind of punishment. Secondly, psychologists play an important role in schools today because they are able to understand the social environment of students, thus, they know what mechanisms use to improve their behaviour. For instance, these professionals are capable to use a bunch of principles, values and speechs that are scientifically proved leaving the physical punishment behind in the history.\nTo conclude, corporal punishment was used in the past to control students behaviour, nowadays it has been drastically reduced Nonetheless some claim that it should be used again to improve conducts. I strongly disagree with this statement because it is proved that this practice caused negative impacts in students life, furthermore, new professions and methods are implemented which have demostrated high rates of efficacy to pursuade and improve the well-behaviour in students.",

    "essay": "Some people believe that modifying behaviour among school-going children can be achieved through corporal punishment, and that it being on the decline in schools, is actually a negative development. I strongly disagree with this this view as I am of the opinion that there are better ways of disciplining children to instill positive behaviour, than physically hitting them.\nImprovement of behaviour among children in schools can be achieved through teaching them good manners rather than using corporal punishment. This means that teachers and school staff should teach children acceptable and unacceptable behaviour as part of their school curriculum from the earleist age they enter school. This way, learners obtain knowledge required for them to practice good behaviour. For example, if a child is taught from primary school-going age that they should clean after their mess, they are likely to practise and carry this behaviour through to secondary school. That way, there would be no need to physically hit children. Although some may firmly believe that corporal punishment is a good form of discipline, it cannot be compared to the actual teaching of good behaviour.\nMoreover, corporal punishment is likely to produce a fearful and resentful child rather than a well mannered child. It has been found by many researchers that children are unlikely to change their bad behaviour because they are beaten up at school. The behaviour is most likely to get worse, instead, as learners become fearful and resent their learning environment. For instance, in South Africa, some learners were reported to be disrespectful to their teachers because of a bad relationship that existed between them and their teachers as a result of corporal punishment that was inflicted on them. While it may be true that some positive behaviour changes were seen among pupils due to use of corporal punishment, this is at a very small scale.\nIn conclusion, I am of the view that the use of corporal punishment among school-going age children is not a desirable phenomenon, as it is unlikely to produce any required behavioural changes. Instead, instilling good manners in learners through teaching them is more effective, as physically hitting them may even worsen their undesirable behaviour.",

    "essay": "Corporal punishment used to be a very popular method in education all around the globe. In the last century there is an opposite trend, which leads to bans on any physical punishment. I believe any corporal punishment should be against the law in schools and any other facilities.\nRecent studies show, that violence is neither most effective nor useful method in education. According to the scientists, any type of physical punishment creates a negative psycological pattern. Students focus on fear and put extra effort into learning things by hard. But students don't use this knowledge or keep it after upcomming test or exam.\nBesides, these methods harm students and reduce creativity in the future. Scientists say, that physically abused kids develop psycological disorders in the future life. This leads to an increased suicide rate, higher chance of depression, and lower happiness.\nMost importantly, physical punishment doesn't address the core of the problem. There are several reasons for a low school performance: a low interest in the topic, a bad explanation, or a low quality of life. To increase students performance we have to focus on quality of education first. But there are some good news. Humanity made a huge progress since internet and youtube are much more accessable nowdays.\nIn general, there is not a single piece of evidence which support physical punishment. It's a method from the past that should not be used nowdays. Corporal punishment leads to lower performance, psycological disorders, and doesn't solve any real problem. This is why it shouldn't be allowed anywhere in the world.",

    "essay": "The Internet has recently become the most widely spread means of communication and knowledge sharing. It is argued by many if any restrictions should be imposed on it. This essay will discuss both views and explain why the Internet should be free from regulations.\nOne group of people consider that the Internet was developed to overcome a government censure, thus any restrictions will destroy its purpose. Despite the fact that there were independent media, it was practically difficult to share news internally and internationally because of low speed of communication methods such as telegraph or post, which lead to the fact that the most common source of information was government authorities who selected the information they wanted to share. Thus, general citizensÃ¢ÂÂ opinion, views and problems were often unheard. This essay agrees that the ability of sharing information freely between people all over the world makes the government to be transparent as everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs opinion and problem may be heard. For example, the problems with extinction of wild animals in Baikal region of Russia due to forest cuts was heard only after a massive attack by the media and local citizens and bloggers that would be impossible without the Internet.\nThe others insist that the Internet allows to people share not only useful knowledge, problems and new, but also violent content. The supporters of the view believe that having an easy access to such content, for example assault, production of bombs, people become prompt to criminal behaviour. Although, the Internet makes the violent information more available, the essay suggests that if an individual want to find violent information, he would do it even in the absence of the Internet. Moreover, recent researches conducted by criminalists uncovered that the increase in the number of criminal offenses is not directly correlated with Internet coverage.\nIn conclusion, although the Internet contains violent content, if needed it may be accessed by interested people from other sources of informations, meanwhile independent flow of information allows individuals to attract attention to their local and even global problems which may be hidden by governments without free Internet.",

    "essay": "It is an undeniable fact that internet is currently worldwide used as a mean of information and communication. However, it is being frecuently controversial, because whereas some claim to control it, others request its entire freedom. In my opinion, Internet needs to be controlled and in some instances it needs to be restricted.\nInternet is a useful modern technology that has changed the methods of communication and the information storage. However, it is vital to establish regulations in its use, because, even though, it is a great technological advance that improved the communication and information procedures. it is also a powerful mechanism that might impact negatively the human lives. For instance, internet can be use to obtain personal information that could be use in unlawful ways such as supplant identities to commit virtual crimes. Therefore, if internet is not use within legal frames, the probabilities of intranet crimes are likely to increase in the entire society.\nOn the other hand, some people claim for its freedom because they do not want to be surveillanced. Althouth some people claim for freedom of their privacy, it looks like they do not understand the importance of a set of rules within the internet to protect privacy. For instance, some couples like to share nude images and videos between themselves through social media apps. however, there is evidence that these kind of content have been stolen to blackmail the couples in return for not revealing their compromising information. Therefore, if people claim for freedom when navigating into the red, it is crucial to have legal parameteres that might help to protect their privacy.\nIn conclusion, internet is used accross the globe to share information and be communicated with others. Nevertheless, controversies about its control and interference are happen offenly. I strongly agree that internet needs to be controlled and restricted by lawful policies in order to protect the privacy of users.",

    "essay": "The Internet is employed extensively across the world, serving as an essential tool of communication. Nevertheless, the widespread use of internet triggers an intense debate. Some people hold that the use of internet should fall under control, while others disagree and argue that such control is groundless. This essay will analyse both positions and illuminate my standpoint.\nAs for those who support the control of the internet use, they may have their position grounded upon the fact that criminal activities run rampant online, threatening individual and public security, as exemplified by hacking technology aimed at stealing personal data illegally, fraudulent advertisements aimed at cheating money and notices post by terrorist groups brainwashing the public. Such activities, if unchecked, may exert undesirable effects on individuals and society. Given such omnipresent dangers online, the control of online activities may be justified.\nOn the contrary, in terms of those objecting to the control of the internet use, they may justify their position by highlighting importance of unlimited online activities, as demonstrated by the improvement of work efficiency. A case in point is that posting advertisements online is apparently more efficient than issuing leaflets on a street, from the perspective of a company intending to publicising its services and products. However, the notices post online may present fake information cheating the public. To address this issue, it is necessary to control online activities.\nAs far as I am concerned, in view of omnipresent hazards online, intervention is needed to screen dangerous information and ensure the safety of the internet use.\nTo conclude, the control of online activities helps to protect us from various cybercrimes, although it may slightly affect the efficiency of work. Personally, I opine that the importance of online control should not be underestimated.",

Some people hold that such control is necessary, while others disagree and argue that the use of internet should not be restricted. This essay will analyse both positions and illuminate my standpoint.\nAs for those agreeing with the control of online activities, they have their position grounded upon the fact that numerous criminal activities run rampant online and should be tackled effectively, as exemplified by fraudulent advertisements aimed at cheating money and hacking technologies targeted at violating privacy. If unchecked, cybercrimes would increasingly disturb the society and cause widespread complaints. Another reason reinforcing this position is that the online information that is inappropriate for minors should be reduced, such as the movies containing erotic or violent scenes, as well as foul language. Otherwise, children may be led astray by such information, acting improperly at home or school.\nIn terms of those who barely support online control, they may justify their position by explaining the importance of unlimited internet access to task efficiency. For instance, businessmen could seek potential clients by online searching, which is apparently more efficient than issuing leaflets on a street publicizing themselves. However, if internet users cannot identify the authenticity of online information, they may assume the risk of being cheated. Given this concern, a certain extent of intervention is needed for screening fake information.\nAs far as I am concerned, I opine that online control is justified, because it helps to address multiple cybercrimes and inappropriate information for adolescents. I expect in the future, more views could arise to furnish the understanding in this regard.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, the Internet has become without doubt the most powerful, convenient and free source of information and communication. It has dramatically changed how we communicate with each other and how we obtain news. With only one push of button on our devices like a smart phone or a laptop we can speak our family members who are thousand miles away from us or read current news without a need for watching TV or buying a newspaper. However, this convenience of the Internet carries some potential threats to the users such as violation of their privacy rights and overflow of unreliable information. Therefore, the users should demand some forms of regulations of the Internet to reduce these risks.\nCertainly, the use of the Internet needs to be regulated if we want to preserve our privacy when using it. Unfortunately, there is an enormous flow of our personal data on the Internet. For example, we eagerly share a lot of information about ourselves simply from our name, address, phone number to more serious one like our accounts number or social security. However, the big sales companies very often buy an access to this data to target us and influence our choices. This practice should be illegal and we as the users need to have a say how our personal data should be handled on the Internet. For this reason, we need to demand privacy laws to have better control how our personal information is managed on the Internet.\nAnother risk of having the Internet free from regulation is that we have no means of protection from unreliable information. I find this risk very dangerous since many people have used the Internet as their primary source of news and rely on it to stay updated with daily news. Now, anybody can become a reporter as long as he or she has access to the Internet. Simply, people can write and post their comments that often donÃ¢ÂÂt have any factual or scientific base. We have witnessed this misinformation during the debate regarding vaccinations for the COVID-19. Many people who objected to be vaccinated made up their mind reading some posts on the Facebook or the Twitter that stated harmfulness of vaccines. These posts are allowed to be posted, because the social media donÃ¢ÂÂt have any obligation to check the content of posts. Clearly, this wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt happen if there were some forms of regulations that can verify better factual content of information on the Internet, so the potential readers can avoid the risk of misinformation.\nSurely, the Internet can no longer stay without any regulatory laws. These policies are necessary to protect our privacy and keep us informed with more reliable information. Simply, the regulation polices of the Internet give us more power to be in control when using the Internet to obtain information or share personal data.",

    "essay": "The internet now serves as a means of communication and passing information across all around the globe. Conversely, it always stirs controversy as a lot of individuals opine that it needs to be regulated while others think that there should be no form of interference.This essay will elucidate both point of views and i will give my opinion.\nSince the advent of internet, life has been a whole lot better than it used to be.People can now get information at the confort of their beds or even while on transit. For example, people can be on the train and will still be able to know the latest news because modern trains now have tvs in them which travellers can use for their relaxation. In addition, internet has made communication incredibly easier and faster.To illustrate, a recent survey showed that over a billion people worldwide make use of Facebook,a social media app in which we can chat with friends and family.It has the feature of both communicating by voice call or video call.\nHowever, there are some demerits of the internet. To start with, it is slowly killing the culture of meeting up with friends and family physically. Due to the fact that you can easily text or call them on phone , majority of individuals now rarely spend time with their friends and loved ones. This will apparently have a negative effect on the bonds of the relatoinships. Secondly, the internet can serve as a tool to spread false informations that can tarnish one's reputation. Take for instance, the senate president of Nigeria was falsely accused of a scandalous affair with an actress. This malicious accusation not only destroyed his home but also costed him his job.\nThe internet is now a popular means of communication and information. However, it should be regulated. News should be thoroughly investigated before it is published so as to avoid doing irrefutable damage to innocent persons.",

    "essay": "In recent years, more people tend to move to big cities from the countryside has been increasing extremely, especially developed countries, including Japan. Therefore, the total population in the country seems to be not changed, but the balance of the population has been widening in a few decades. I would like to share some example in Japan and suggest ideas to reverse its population in the countryside.\nMainly, job opportunities in the big cities are much higher than in the countryside. The majority of companies and foreign company branches tend to be located in Tokyo, and Osaka. Therefore, people need to move to the big cities or suburbs area to get their jobs. This means that real estate, house, and apartment prices have been soaring drastically. Moreover, the phenomenon connects to the prices rise up in a variety of industries. For example, the food prices in the restaurants need to raise due to monthly tenants payment has been surging. Therefore, people can easily get or change their job in big cities, it is not necessarily wealthy.\nNevertheless, ironically, since Covid-19 widely spread worldwide, many companies launched remote work. Even now, the majority of people do not need to commute to the office. In addition, some companies declare that they never change the working system in the future, because they have already systemized the IT system which is able to work remotely. Therefore, this is a great chance for the Japanese government to dissipate the population in local cities. If people start to move to local cities or countryside, the population in the local cities or countryside increased. It will be not only helpful for people to live there with reasonable prices, but also for effective economic growth in the local cities and countryside. In addition, the local governments will be able to organize the infrastructure, roads, medical care, and education. As a result, the quality of the infrastructure will be close to the big cities.\nFinally, if the government financially supported this remote working system to companies, the above phenomenon will be available. As a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider, and people will be able to get job opportunities with living in the countryside.",

    "essay": "People move from the countryside into the cities. It occurs in many parts of the world, causing problems, especially in urban areas. This essay will elaborate on the causes of this movement, and the way it can be reversed from my personal standpoint.\nCentralization has caused this movement. All the major institutions and facilities are in the cities. Thus, people in rural areas have to sacrifice considerable time and effort to travel to urban centres. As it is also costly, people choose to move into the cities so that traveling does not consume their time. For instance, one-fifth of the total population in Korea currently lives in Seoul, the capital city of Korea. In fact, all the educational, medical, and entertainment facilities are centralized in urban areas. It can be reserved by implementing decentralization. The government has to disperse the location of the major institutions and diverse types of facilities into different districts so that people living in remote areas can also benefit.\nFurthermore, people in remote areas want to earn opportunities for better employment or education. As a city is a point where technologies, investments ,and professions gather, there is a better opportunity for people to get employed or educated in a improved quality. Therefore, people choose to leave the countryside. Thereby, the government can initiate the policies in which firms earn benefit when they move their head office to districts. If the firms commence moving, it will produce a great amount of employment.\nConclusively, not only the government but also the businesses and institutions have to co-operate to combat problems resulting from a surge in the movement of people from the countryside into the cities.",

    "essay": "The domestic migration from countryside to urban areas is a constant fact in a great number of parts of the globe, which results in problems, especifically in cities. In my opinion, some of the causes might be the transition from agricultural to technological economies and the lack of support from governments to coutryside economy. I will suggest that major support and promotion of the agricultural services might encourage people to stay at coutryside.\nThe national migration is a well-know fact that happen into the countries as a product of technological advancements and its impact in the national and international economy. The service sector is nowadays the main activity within the countries, which resulted in more opportunities along the the cities of the world because this sector is mainly located in cosmopolitan areas, therefore, rural people have decided to emigrate to the cities seeking to improve their standard of living. Additionally, with the growth of the service sector, governments have reduced the funding for countryside which resulted in high rates of unemployed people in that regions. This lack of support, encourage the movement of people as a negative side effects in the cities because of overcowded populations.\nIn order to mitigate the overcrowded populations accross the cities in the world, it is crucial to support and promote the country side economies to avoid the movement of people domestically. Governmments need to increase the budged allocated to rural areas, but additionally, they ought to provide better systems to promote and increase the participation of agricultural economies. If farmers find the adecuate support to produce the farms, they are less unlikely to abandond their lands because they already have a livelyhood. This support may impact benefically in cities because differents social issues could be reduced.\nIn conclusion, it is an undeniable fact that the domestic migration happens because of technological advancements and lack of support to countryside economy. Nonetheless, if some measures are incremented and adecuated to the countryside. I strongly believe that farmers are likely to work their lands instead of migrate.",

    "essay": "In many parts across the globe, people are migrating from rural areas to urban areas in search of a better life. However, this rapid migration has led to popluation explosion in cities which seems to put tremendous pressure on available resources. In order to restore normalcy, this movement ought to be reversed and this can be done in a number of ways.\nTo begin with, the most common reason why people move to urban centers from rural areas is the fact that urban areas provide a wide range of opportunities that enable people to live a better life. For instance, all major metropolitan areas in the world provide access to state-of-the-art facilties in healthcare and education. Needless to say, both these aspects are the piilars of a good quality life that every individual desires to live. Unfortunately, as rural areas generally lag far behind in both these aspects, people are forced to migrate to cities. Moreover, urban dwellers are undoubtedly benefitted by advancements in all avenues of inquiry compared to their rural counterparts. This is because of the speed with which urban areas are able to incorporate these advancments into their infrastructure. While it may take a couple of months for a technological innovation to make its way to a village, it is not uncommon to see resdidents of a city making use of that innovation within no time. Thus, it makes perfect sense for people to leave the countryside in order to settle in cities.\nHowever, cities are suffering from a host of problems because of large number of people opting to settle here. Firstly, accomodating a burgeoning population is a grave challenge that grips cities. This can be circumvented by providing villages with the basic facilties essential to support life. This would deter people from migrating to cities. Besides, if attempts are made to integrate rural areas into the mainstream, they would be benefitted by latest technological developments and people would no longer feel the need to move to cities in order to take advantage of those advancements.\nTo conclude, although there are many reasons why individuals are migrating from the countryside into the cities in many parts of the world, if development in rural areas is emphazised upon, this trend could be reversed.",

I will write about my thought of the cause of the movement from the countryside into the cities, and if there is a possibility to reverse this event, what it will be.\nFirst, I think the cause of the movement is partly because of the difference of the convenience, and the work types you can get between in the countrysides, and in the cities. Personally I do prefer to live in the countrysides, but I can't bare if there are none or slow internet connections there. Also I think the varieties of the jobs you can get are quite different in each location. For example, when I went to Australia to get jobs, of course people tend to stay in the cities so that they can get easy, fancy city jobs like waiter/waitress, shop retail, jobs related with news papers and so on. However the number of jobs are limited. I really wanted to stay in the city, but the amount of money you get was not quite enough to pay rent, and holiday fee, so I moved into the countrysides which had varieties of farm jobs. Sure there were easy jobs like in the cities, but the number of shops, and restaurants are quite small, and they were hiring mostly local people rather than working holiday workers. There I got a farm hand job in the tomato field. It was really hard job. We needed to work from 7 am when the sun rises to 6 pm when the sun sets. It was hard for my poor body, too. That is why I think most people move to the cities rather than stay in the countrysides.\nAlthough I am not sure if there is a possibility to reverse this event, I think there are quite a lot of good experience you can only get in the countrysides. One thing I can say is the people and the living pace are slower, and more relaxed in countrysides than in the cities. For example like I myself said, I prefer living in the countrysides than in the cities. In fact I moved to Edmonton in Canada, which is a city, but I'd say more like a town, but a lot more relaxed than Tokyo where I used to live. Sometimes people living in the crazy fast cities like Tokyo, New York, and etc actually want to slow down the pace to more relaxing cities, or countrysides. If we want to reverse this movement, I think you need to advertise what benefits you can get in the countrysides. For example, they have quite magnificent views, good benefits to raise your kids, and so on. I think it can really reverse the movement because nowadays people are so interested in the educations of their kids, so scientifically we need to prove that living in the countrysides, and raising the children can be really beneficial for them. I myself have 2 children, and I can feel the benefits of living in the countrysides. The more free time they have, the more creative they become, and I strongly believe the more creative they are, the more happier they can lead their lives.\nAs a result, I believe that we can reverse, or slow down the speed of the movement of the people from the countrysides into the cities if we empharsise the benefits of raising kids in the countrysides more.",

    "essay": "Nowadays all over the world more and more families immigrate from rural to urban areas and such a situation leads to a number of undesirable consequences for city residents and regions in general. In this essay I shall try to cover some reasons for this trend as well as provide a number of solutions.\nTo start with, we have to consider the logic behind this movement. Firstly, as a rule, the countryside does not have enough educational institutions, so after finishing high school most students are obliged to move to other parts of the country in order to obtain higher education and, eventually, apply for well-paid jobs that are available only in bigger cities. Secondly, despite being provided with basic services, people still feel the lack of entertainment facilities, such as cinemas, theaters and others. In other words, most of the rural population is bored and have nothing else to do, that is why they are bound to immigrate to urban areas.\nLuckily, there are a number of solutions, which could be implemented and, hopefully, they can solve or, at least, ease the situation. Initially, it is vitally important that the government allocates more funds to rural areas and use this money for construction of public amenities such as hospitals, schools, kindergartens, and others. If those facilities were introduced, then villagers would have fewer incentives to move. The second option that we have to consider is to promote living in the countryside by providing tax cuts, subsidies and other measures of economic stimulation, which could prove to be effective in the long run.\nAll things considered, it can be clearly seen that the lack of facilities and money are the two most important reasons as to why more villagers move to the cities. Unless the government provides a number of economic incentives along with public facilities, it might be difficult to overturn this trend.",

    "essay": "Weather to have children or not is one of the most important questions young adults have to ask themselfs nowadays. Overpopulation is one of the many global problems next to climate change, and poverty.\nIn my opinion, the need to have children roots back to us being nothing more, but civilised animals. Animals have one goal above all; reproduce. This is why in many cultures, men and women who cannot have chlidren are seen as disabled, or sick. Nowadays, modern values changed our perspective, having children is often seen as a necessity for a happy, and successful life.\nIt is important to recognise the problems the developed world faces. There is smoke in the air, plastic pollution everywhere, poverty in third world countries, and many other factors that make Earth a terrible place for many. Above all, the life we give birth to will have to eat, drink, and consume just like everyone else, using more and more of the already limited resources, generating more and more trash.\nMany people argue that the above mentioned points are a pessimistic and unrealistic. Humans have to reproduce, to keep the species from extintion. And truthfully the only way to do that, is to give birth as many kids as possible. This issue lies deep in our society; here in Hungary, a family is rewared almost 30000 USD if they have 3 or more kids. This means that many people have children because they get money for it, and they are also seen socially accepted.\nI believe modern day intelligence goes further than IQ points and money earned. We have to recognise the problems created, overpopulation being one of them. While I do not believe that we should not have kids, I think there should be careful planning involved and self-reflection before giving birth to new life.",

    "essay": "Boxing is really dangerous sport which usually leads to physical injuries. However, I do not agree that it is inappropriate for the modern age to has such a sport, since it is a huge part of our culture and many people actually enjoy watching it.\nTo begin with, boxing is depicted as blood but fair and honorable sport in different kinds of art, such as literature and cinema. For instance, Ernest Hemingway has a number of stories related to this sport in his book \"Men Without Women\", and there are also various movies about boxing. A one may become boxer for different reasons: it could be encouraged by existing culture, it could be a wish to fight fairly without any lie which is rarely achievable in life outside sport, or a way to throw out internal aggression. In any way, it is his or her freedom of choise whether to take part in this sport or not, and I believe it is absolutely not appropriate to forbid people boxing.\nFurthermore, people actually like watching boxing, otherwise it would not be so popular. They associate themselves with a sportsman and experience rush and adrenaline along with him. After a competetion, fans usually feel relief as after great movie, except they know that all the action took place in real life, which is not a case for movies. This perception of reality increases the feelings greatly, leading to more fascinating experience.\nIn the end, I want to underline this again: I believe that boxing is totally appropriete for the modern world, along with other extreme sports, and its cancellation would be absolutely unfair and generally bad, even though it is undisputably very injury-prone.",

    "essay": "Boxing is a dangerous kind of sport that may cause physical injury. Some people tend to believe that this sport should not exist nowadays. This controversial statement has both advantages and disadvantages, which will be discussed in this essay.\nA tremendous number of people think that boxing is an excellent way to fit a body and improve coordination. For instance, if parents want their kids to know how to defend themselves, they let them attend boxing masterclasses. However, the main aim for parents is to find a skilled, experienced coach for their children. They may think if a teacher is an expert, their kids will not suffer during training. Notwithstanding, it does not always work like that.\nOn the other hand, a lot of people completely disagree that boxing as a business industry has a right to exist in the modern world. They are convinced that people who fight should not suffer because of the wishes of rich people who enjoy the show. For example, if a young person gets a physical injury during a fight, he will probably get money for that; however, it does not mean that he will get better after the final battle. Also, people who protest against this blood sport probably dislike advertisements related to boxing. They may think that even these videos impact people's behaviour and motivate them to commit violence against others.\nIn conclusion, boxing is a part of the blood business that should be forbidden in the modern age. From my point of view, if a person wants boxing nowadays, there are a lot of different ways to do it, like VR simulation, without harming other people.",

    "essay": "Boxing is a sport that draws many visitors and a steady stream of new athlets. But that might be suprising, since it is a violent sport that often results in serious injuries of the participants. As a developed society, who at large condemns fighting, the continued interest can be seen as undermining our values and beliefs.\nWhile using fists to communicate is definitely inappropriate people claim, that this is not what happens in a boxing match. Everybody who steps into the ring consents to the physical altercation and is aware of the risks associated with it. Furthermore, there are precautions taken and a jury in session to make sure nobody gets seriously hurt. Those points cause many fans of the sport to claim, that it is not so differnt to most other sports since there is always a possibility to get hurt. Additionally, one might argue that what two consenting adults do in there past time or as their job is just nobody elses business.\nOn the other hand, people who don't think boxing should continue, often are convinced that society sets the wrong incentives. The promise of fame and quick money that is often associated with a career in boxing might tempt some to disregard their long-term health for short-term gain. Since socially disadvantaged individuals are less likely to have alternative prospects, one might argue that it is not a real choice after all. Another concern of critics is the corruption of the audience. Frequent exposure to violent entertainment is often connected to a higher likelyhood to become violent.\nWhile I can understand that boxing is not for everyone, I think that the personal freedom of everyone involved should be respected. Because at the end, nobody is forced to watch or take part in a boxing match.",

    "essay": "There is debatable issue as to whether boxing, a seemingly bloody sport, should be excluded from the modern society. As far as I am concerned, the attempt to remove boxing from the current age is utterly unjustified.\nAdmittedly, boxing is often associated with various disturbing factors, such as foul language, disregard to rivals, violent punches and inelegant appearance as a result of intense physical contacts. However, such gory scenes may frequently take place in underground boxing games which are barely recognised by the professional community of boxing and by the legal system. Unlike underground boxing, professional boxing upholds moral principles and universal values, for examples, respect to opponents, obedience of rules, etc. Also, professional boxers are protected by safety equipment and judges who may stop the game when witnessing any player suffering serious injuries. Therefore, the health hazards involved in boxing games may not be as severe as the public assumes.\nAnother reason reinforcing my position is that boxing already enjoys considerable popularity around the world and plays an important part in people's entertainment, as exemplified by the successful ticket sales of most boxing games and high audience rating of TV programmes broadcasting boxing matches. Given such popularity of boxing, the removal of this sport may cause widespread dissatisfaction and complaint.\nTo draw a conclusion, the exclusion of boxing is completely groundless and irrational, given the safety protection, sportmanship and popularity as reflected in this sport. I expect in the future, more views could arise to furnish the understanding in this regard.",

    "essay": "There are many factors to encourage the quality of societies, some people believe that competitiveness is the main factor to improve communities. The following essay will focus on importance of competitiveness on individuals and cite my opinion which believe that it is a positive trend to develop societies.\nFirst of all, if you want to improve a skill of an individual in the differnet aspects of life like sport, you should play him with higher level to develop his talent and get best of him. For example ,a famous tennis table player from my town said in an interview, that he improved his talent when he played against his older brother, he was working hard in training sessions to reach the higher level, the standard that his brother plays in order to beat him and win games. The competetion between him and his brother lift up his skills and strenthgen his mentality.\nsecondly, competitions may create good atmosphere and healthy climate for children to improve thier abilitie in study. For example, my daughter and her friends in the class were struggling in studying math, the math teacher found a way to make the math more interesting for students, the teacher announced for a competition every day at the end of lesson, she writes an equations on the board and gives prizes for students who can solve them. Nowadays, my daughter is enjoying to solve math problems. Furthermore, competitions can improve people's career, and increase company's outcome, some managers tend to encourage competitiveness between employers to have more benefits for company and workers as well.\nTo conclude, competitiveness enables people to improve their talents and students to love what they study, also employers will develop their skills, as a result of that most societies will get more benefits of this trend.",

    "essay": "Competitiveness is a desirable quality for individuals. This essay will analyse the effects of competitiveness on people and illuminate my view as to whether the eagerness of competition represents an auspicious or ominous tendency.\nThere are mainly two types of influence exerted by competitiveness on people. The most prominent repercussion resides in that the desire of competition drives people to work or study more diligently in order to stand out from the rest and achieve success. Such diligence enables people to accumulate sufficient experience that helps them improve capabilities and obtain better results. Apart from that, another important effect of competitiveness is that competitors may seek considerable pleasure in competition, especially when defeating competent rivals and obtaining hard-earned victories. Such success makes people realise how excellent they are and gives them tremendous satisfaction. Even if losing the competition, people may still be satisfied with such a precious opportunity that helps them understand their disadvantages and thus, encourages them to work harder.\nAs far as I am concerned, I opine that competitiveness is a positive phenomenon, because it not only helps people become industrious learners or workers with sufficient experience and great potential of making progress, but also makes their daily lives more enjoyable as beating strong opponents may give them a unique sense of satisfaction. Therefore, I think that the importance of competitiveness should never be underestimated.\nTo sum up, the effects of competitiveness can be manifested by the impetus driving people to work or study harder, and the unique pleasure of competing against strong rivals. Personally, I hold that this is an auspicious trend.",

Personally, I assume that it is a great opportunity for people to develop their skills, relationships, imrove the level of knowledge and become a leader in different spheres. In this essay, I shall examine the way it has an influence on people and inderstand whether it is a beneficial quality.\nAnalyzing the impact of competitiveness, I agree that it helps people with trying to give all the best and not let another person to win. Moreover, if there were no competitiveness at my school, I would not try to do various projects or developing my skills to be an excellent student. This quality helps me always raise the bar even more. Also, I know that many famous brends such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci compete with each other all the time to take a leadership position in a fashion world.\nAs for being positive or negative, I am of the opinion that competitiveness is a positive trend due to numerous reasons. First of all, analyzing sports competition, I understand that it is a social process, depending on the biological and social changes that all people are going through. Secondly, in an age of social media and growing individualism, time spent interacting and communicating with others is reducing. However, our ability to work with others to achieve a common goal is an essential skill to develop, not only in sport but in life.\nIn coclusion, a competition can improve people's all-round development while it can give exceeding pressure on them more than they can deal with.

    "essay": "Life is full of competition. Soon after the release from competitive university exams, the hard fighting for higher positions in a company will be waiting for you. While the competitiveness has been bringing us a convenient society, no small number of employments have been tired of never-ending competitions. No doubt about a positive effect on societies, but when we start to argue about the effect on individuals, it becomes more controversial. This essay will argue the drawbacks of competitiveness for individuals, especially from the perspective of Japanese modern society and typical Japanese office workers. I believe that cooperativeness and uniqueness are sometimes more important attitude than competitiveness.\nFirstly, competitiveness causes less diversity. If there is a competition, there must be the same evaluation metrics to differentiate winners and losers. The evaluation procedure needs to limit the metrics into specific aspects of the human being. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to prove that the metrics are proper for all of the possible cases and effective for the HR evaluation. For example, Japanese companies are likely to judge quantitatively based on the numbers related to performance. However, how can we evaluate the cooperativity or the non-quantitative performance like in creative jobs? Most Japanese companies adopted the HR evaluation methods based on average working hours per day and number of reports monthly. ThatÃ¢ÂÂs why the Japanese tend to overwork to fulfill this requirement. In addition, as a result of placing more importance in quantity of reports, rather than quality, Japanese employees are prone to choose easy and short-term tasks or outsourcing instead of building by their own methods. This tendency causes fewer complicated and long-term tasks.\nSecondly, competitiveness causes less cooperativeness. Fewer people volunteer to play a disadvantageous role for smooth teamwork. Moreover, some people play an evil role by blaming or cheating the competitors in order to be superior to them. As a consequence, overall efficiency will decline and some people will be overestimated. Even if there are no problems temporarily, the long-lasting large companies will eventually become corrupt, and those who have the most political power, rather than real power, will remain at the top.\nConsequently, competitiveness is the basis of capitalism which brings us a brighter and more convenient society, however, biased evaluation and less cooperative working environment possibly drive people into nervous breakdowns. Karoshi, overwork death derived from too much stress and less sleeping, is one of the most serious social problems in Japan. We may need to rethink about the competitiveness.",

Karoshi, overwork death derived from too much stress and less sleeping, is one of the most serious social problems in Japan. We may need to rethink about the competitiveness.",

    "prompt": "Traffic and housing problems could be solved by moving large companies, factories and their employees to the countryside.Do you agree or disagree?",
    "essay": "Many metropolises are facing challenges, including traffic gams and serious lacking of housing available for families to live, particular in the developed countries. The governments are looking for a way to lessen the volume of traffic in the cities and to increase the number of housing provision over the metropolises. Some people advocate the businesses including large corporations and factories along with their employees moving to the suburbs which is the best way to figure out the metropolitan problems. Is this a sheer solution for these challenges faced by the cities?\nEconomy boom in a country is accompanied with a number of problems incurred in the cities due to the multitudes living in there. It is no wonder that metropolises represent more job opportunities available and better education system to next generations. These are strong pull factors appealing people to stay in the cities despite the higher cost in living. A larger number of populations in the cities not only result in a severe shortage of housing where there is a higher demand of housing over the available supply, but also bring the higher volume of traffic across the cities, particular in a peak hour when a thousand and one employees commuting to work and students going to schools. Some people believe the working location shifting to rural areas is a solution that enables to lessen the frequent usage of roads in cities. Simultaneously, it is assumed that the housing issue can be solved naturally arising from the migration of their employees into the suburban town next to their working place.\nThe business allocated to suburbs alone is rarely considered enough to tackle these problems. A place to live requires the basic facilities to serve for clothing, food, housing and transportation which are basic needs of human. If there is a working place and residential area only in the suburban town without any infrastructures, people have no choice to drive their vehicles back and forth between cities and their living places for the general consumption. As a consequence, the traffic congestion in cities will be worsen combining with the significant deterioration of air quality in the countryside due to an increase in the emission of the greenhouse gases. Therefore, the governments play a key role to establish a neighborhood which could be self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas. This may be a feasible and effective way to minimize the metropolitan issues.\nMy own view is that the shifting strategies in suburbs can help lessen the challenges faced by metropolises. But the governments should take the smart planning into consideration in which the employment bases with the living infrastructures are developed in the suburban town.",

    "essay": "It is often argued that by moving large companies,factories and it employees,traffic and housing problems could be irradicated.I completely agree to this fact that these problems could be solved by taking this step.\nTraffic and housing problems has been a major problem in big cities due to the increasing population in these areas.The main contribution to the rapidly growing population are the multinational companies and the industries that have been set in the cities.These companies have a thousands of employees.As a result,if these companies are established in cities,it will lead to lot of traffic.For example,mumbai,a major city in India has uncontrollable traffic due to the vast IT sector present there.It has been very difficult for the people living in mumbai to travel even the shortest distances as it takes a lot of time to move from one place to another.The demand for housing also increases due to large number of employees from industries and huge companies which inturn leads to drastic increase in the expenses for housing.As a result,they have to compromise for small houses due to high rents.\nThe only solution for this problem is by mobilising the big companies and industries to countryside which has a lot of empty lands.By taking this step,it is both benefitial to the companies as well as the employees.The cost of establishment of the companies will be significantly low in the outskirts of the cities and the rural areas compared to the city.The employees also save a lot of time due to relatively less traffic and they also benefit to a large extent by low housing exenses.The traffic, housing problems and the pollution in the cities will also be reduced by taking this initiative.\nTo conclude,the employees, the people in the citiesand the companies as a whole could benefit by mobilising the industries and multinational companies from the cities to the country side due to the above reasons.",

    "essay": "Sport play an essential role in shaping the personality of individual. Some people believe that sports which are played in teams are more beneficial like football, while others think that solo sports like tennis or swimming is better. The following essay will discuss both arguments and give my opinion that sports which are played in teams have more advantages over solo sport activites.\nFirst of all, there is no doubt that the individual sport activities enahnce people confidence. It helps building the personality and strentghen the mentality of the individuals. For examole, one role model in my home country was playing tennis table, he mentioned once in an interview, that sport helped him not only to win trophies but it raised his mental strength and shaped his pesonality.\nHowever, some people believe that, sports which are played in teams\nhave more advantages and all community will get the benefits. Soccer, for example, will help the players specifically the young children to understand working together and sharing the responsibility. In addition people will grow with better understanding to the concept of sharing achievements which can improve all the community. For instance, i was a member of soccer team in high school, me and my friends were taught, in order to win games we should put plans together and work as one unit. Furthermore, it helps me later in my career to understand the meaning of leadership and how the sharing responsibility and working together could bring the success to our endeavour.\nTo conclude, solo sport can bring proud and honour to individuals but\nsports which played in teams teach people the meaning of working together which will improve the community in the future.",

This is an issue that considerably affects our choices in athletism and consequently our mode of living.This essay will consider whether the the overall effect of being a member of a sports team is positive or negative.\nIt is an undeniable fact that by taking part in teams benefits a lot someone's social prowess. That is owing to the fact that social skills are inextricably linked to the way individuals cooperate with each other.A prime example is the athletes in competitions who pay respect to the opponent.Notwithstanding the fact that people realize how they are suppose to behave to others , there is a handful of people for whom doing sports alone offers them more relaxation.\nIn addition, being a part of a team plays a pivotal role in creating relationships .That is due to the fact that people interact with each other and learn about the personality traits of the team members. In spite of the fact that team provide the chance to become more social , there are team of low quality in which individuals may feel disturbed. A typical example is teams consisted of children at a tender age which may treat unfairly some other members given they differ in color or religious outlook.\nIn conclusion , it is reasonable to maintain that sports that require participating in teams is not less disadvantageous than individual sports .",

This essay will discuss both views and my opinion.\nSome people insist that punishment is a priority as culprits have gone agaisnt ones country's law. When they serve more years in prison, there is no chance for them to re-commit crime. In addition, some suppose that those who can not afford themselves, will feel better in the prison. As prisoners have to live in a systmatized cycle, they do not need to plan their budget and life. There is interview with an offender who continuously commits crime to go back to the prison.\nContemporarily, others say that there are better ways to reduce crime, such as rehabiliation and education. Most offenders lack moral value. Furthermore, they mostly have wrong mindsets or thoughts as some have never been educated properly. Therefore, other people think that education is better way to improve prisoners' behaviour. Society ought to give an opportunity to re-start their life again.\nI agree more with the second view. Obviously, we have to punish those people whoever break the law. However, punishment should not be a priority. Education is important. Community need to lead a way for them so that they can re-born as a totally different person. There is a statistics of crimes rates in the United States of America which implicits that strict punishment and longer prison sentences reversely led to an increase in crime rates. Therefore, the government needs to concentrate more on education and rehabiliation rather than security and control.",

    "essay": "There is an opinion which is that the longer prison sentences is the best solution to reduce crime. On the contrary, some people say that there are better solutions to solve this problem. Overall, I totally agree with the latter opinion because I think that giving long prison sentences can not directly reduce crime.\nFirstly, I observe the advantage about giving longer prison sentences. Surely, people may hesitate to commit crime by strict sentences. Even if they would commit crime, they would have to be in prison for long days. In addition, living in prison for a long time may give a time to reflect themselvs for them.\nHowever, if crimers would be in the prison for a long time, it might be difficult for them to make them living on themselves because they might not be used to the social reality. It may cause them to commit crime again.\nIn addition to this, I think the poverty and a lot of burdens which people have may cause to commit crime. Because of two reasons, I think that countries have to propose policies which can stimulate economy and relieve their anxieties. Recently, many countries have experienced a recession. It cause the increasing the unemployment rate, so a lot of people suffer from hunger because of the povery. It will be supposed to cause them commit crime such as robbing. Then, people have many burdens because of woriking, raising their children and caring their parens. They have a lot of stress, so even if they could not reduce their stress, they might commit crime to reduce their mental pain. They may want a relax time.\nI think the latter opinion is more valid than the former by these reasons. These are my opinion about this problem.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, due to increasing of crime rate, some people tend to think of the best way to decline crime is giving a longer prison sentences. However, some criticisms probably believe that there should have much better ways to decrease crime. In my opinion, that is true to some extent for this statement. That means the prison sentences may be necessary, but I perfer the other ways such as education and detenion center rather than the prison sentences, especially for minors.\nFirstly, it is possible to said that increasing the punishment would decline the crime in the society. Considering the fact that most of citizens afraid to lose their freedom as a longer time. Given the circumstance, Hong Kong goverment established a policy which force people to scan the QR code with the Leave Home Safe app for against the Covid-19, it was not very common initially without any punishment, yet after announcing the 10-year prison sentences amd 60-throusand-dollar fines, HongKongers use the app quite often now. So that probably means that the more punlishment they will get, the more attentive and cautious they will have.\nOn the other hand, it seem likely to have another proper ways to reduce the crimes . One example is creat a better and well-rounded education for people, particularly for youngsters. Some people could think of it is a more efficient way to develop and nurture thier manner for their whole life. For example, there are a lot of different kind of extra curriculums which consist of having a talk with polices and ICAC for students to join and teach them some form of concept to be a good citizen and take their responsibilities living in Hong Kong. Perhaps, it can show them some societal expectation rather than arresting them and destroy their future.\nTo summarize, there are different opinions for this statement. Even so, I believe that if we had spoon-feed information and set a better model for people, it will help people to reflect on their bad behaviour. Likewise, if goverment only established a lot of punishment for his residents consisently, they may feel stress out. It is probably not good for a long term development for a morden as well as international city and country.",

However, some are divided and think that a number of better ways can help lessen the cases of crime. Which strategy should be taken to tackle this problem? This essay attempts to explore the view of both sides.\nAn increase in the rate of crimes is a raising concerns in the community. A longer prison sentence seems to be the straightforward method to impede the crimes caused. In fact, a continuous incarceration is no room for offenders to commit the crimes in the community. This seemingly becomes an immediate achievement in the short term period.

In 2013, the U.S.A. had a reoffending rate of 52% which prisoners reoffended within a year of release with a record of 49.2% in the U.K. The proportion of reoffenders occupied nearly a half of criminals.

    "essay": "Today, the advertising has become very powerfull thanks to the television and the internet. But is it true that it is now more important in terms of sail rates, than the goods themselves and the actual requests of the society?\nFirst of all, I think that usually in the one selected price range, all the products serving the same purpose have more or less equal properties such as quality or taste. This is indeed true, for example, for many electronic devices which are are produced by the nearby factories somewhere in China regardless the brand, and therefore their sales depend more on marketing strategies.\nHowever, if the one buys the goods of well known brand, he trusts the experience beneath this brand. This is a kind of assurance that a consumer gets excactly what he expects and that a product is not defective. For instance, when choosing the car, you probably would firstly consider BMW or Mercedec. The reason why you know them is not only good advertising, but also quality proved by millions of clients throughout the years.\nMoreover, I believe that modern society actually moves towards the conscious consumption. This implies people becoming more and more awared of product and its manufactoring process ratheer than advertising. From that the decreasing of the aggressive marketing follows, though the marketing still has cruical role. In fact its focus changes so that it will become more informative and less disturbing in the future.\nIn conclusion I want to disclose my own point of view. I do agree with the topic to the certain extent, though I am sure advertising is only a one reason of high sales, among many others and its influence will decrease with time.",

    "essay": "There is no doubt that nowadays advertising plays a very strong role in saling goods. The high rate of sales does not always mean the real needs of some goods. In this essay, i will discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion.\nIn terms of advertising's power in increasing sales of popular consumer goods, advertising has an essencial role these days in sales. The main reason given to support this claim is advertisnig attracts people and inform people about the new and special products in a very special way. To illustrate, using social media for marketing and advertising raise sales dramatecly. People spend most of their times to watch what is in the social media and that means social media is the best way to do your marketing.\nHowever, some people say that people buy these products not because they really need them but because they like the way that was used to advertise these products. On the other hand, some times people purchase goods because they have seen them or heard about them from others or from the social media not due to their needs of these products.\nIn conclusion, I believe that increasing the sales of some popular consumer goods show how strong is advertising and how advertising plays a crucial role in saling products. Also, smart business owners should think about advertising as a fast way to sale their goods. As was previously menthond, people can be attracted by all kinds of advertising and that definitly lead to increasing the sale rate.",

    "essay": "Based on some alledges, publicity is the main reason for the high rate of selling not humans' requirements. Although in my point of view, commercials are impressive in realms that people are looking for to address their demands. However, some other factors are uttered here.\nOne of the most highlighted contributors has to do with the high quality of accepted brands among their rivals. To enlighten, some domestic brands that have been even supported by both public and similarly authorities never can compete with other abroad commodities, as, not only in the real of quality but in terms of price also they cannot attain any level among other imported things. As a vivid case, Japanese cars are utilized in the majority of countries, while other companies, such as American ones, have lost their attraction owing to their high rate of consumption of fossil fuels.\nFurthermore, based on the alternations that have taken place in the world, like either the increasing population or the change of lifestyle, both the type and as well the number of substances that used to be utilized have undergone drastic shifts. For instance, individuals' usage of fast foods has skyrocketed in the last decade, due to the lack of time for cooking, hence the development of takeaways is eye-catching while the number of their customers has swelled sharply.\nOn the other hand, whereas advertising has been effective for some international firms, it would not be feasible if the improvement of transportation did not emerge. To illustrate, the main role is played by second-to-none commuting systems for delivering divergent products, therefore without their assistance, introducing goods to other parts of the universe seems to be meaningless while society does not have access to them as their choices.\nTo conclude, while publicity, nowadays, is exploited as a means for enhancing the chance of selling in different markets, to me, it is impossible to become prosperous if folks do not need those things. Nevertheless, other justifications that are associated with the appeal of various merchandise, namely their quality, should not be ignored.",

    "essay": "In recent years, news reports on TV programs and news papers tend to focus on incidents and emergencies rather than positive developments. In Japan, because of this phenomenon, many people are influenced this country might be more dangerous than they thought. I disagree with these tendencies and should focus on more positive developments, including entertainment.\nTo go into detail, in Japan, once people turn on the TV in the morning. People face often face some news reports about a murder case, who were murdered, who is the criminal, and background details. In addition, there are more than 5 channels on TV, these all 5 channels broadcast the same incident at the same time. The Japanese government might take the control of media in order to agitate people to keep their attention on safety. It might be important to some extent, but it is not necessarily a good influence on people's mind if they were required to watch such a fierce, and negative incident every morning.\nIn contrast, when it comes Japanese crime rate, and case. They reached a peak of 2014, and keep decreasing until now. The cases are not significant derrence, compared with a few dacase ago. In addition, almost Japanese crimes tend to be petty crimes, such as thefts, frauds, shop lifting, and so on. In terms of the murder case, Japan is ranked as the 5th safest country among 160 countries in 2017. This means that the more media reported the savage crimes, people misunderstand Japanese society is getting more dangerous than a few decades ago.\nFinally, it is understandable to report such a heavy incident to some extent. On the other hand, they should also report positive and attractive news, such as tourism, especially inbound sales figures has been increasing and contributing to Japanese economic growth, and some Japanese athletes have been successful in MLB(major league baseball), and football. This news must be more fascinating for Japanese people to encourage their own national identity.\nIn conclusion, this is not a black-and-white issue. But it might be more beneficial for people's minds to be positive. If some heavy incidents happened, the Japanese government should restrict TV companies to broadcasting only one channel, or limit the time shorter.",

    "essay": "News reports in the media focus on problems and emergencies more often than on some positive events. Is it really harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole?\nLet us consider the purpose of the media existence first. I suppose it is to spread important information, so that people may use it in their lives. And problems are usually more important than some positive developments, since, in fact, they are the things which people should be aware of in the first place. For example, due to the COVID, which is an international problem, many people lost their jobs. If they had been notified about the rising of pandemic though, they would have prepared somehow (save more money by cutting unnecessary expenses, learn a new profession and so forth).\nMoreover, I believe problems shall be solved. And when people are concerned about some problems, they may tend to face them with honor and participate in solving them. For instance, the energy crisis is a huge problem, and it is important to aware society of it, so that individuals could try to be more careful with gas and electricity. In the end, society will benefit from it, so it is not harmful.\nOn the other hand, there is some negative impact of bad news on individuals sometimes.

People just should not fall in despair because of news reports, but think how they could take an advantage of the provided information to minimize a negative impact and help humanity to solve problems.\nFinally, in my view, the stated tendency is not really harmful to society, but it may sometimes be harmful to the individuals, and they are responsible for it.",

    "essay": "Our actions in Present time are product of the Past. It also concerns the Judge sphere. But sometimes laws and jury has no access to the information from defectant's background. Some peple - including lawyers - believe the accused person's past is very important. I completely argee with it and in this essay I will support my piont of view with some arguments.\nFirstly, without knowing defectant's past, he could to throw everyone off the scent. Persons who are being accused of the crime usually try to soften their sentence. Tey are capable to lie about many things to avoid the prison.\nSecondly, the defectant can have criminal record in past, so with having access to accused's background the point about this could help in researching the dicision of the case. For this part, is also possible to mention than criminal persons could intentionally go to the prison for some common case such as steeling somebody's property, to avoid of punishment of anything more serious and horrible like murdering or unlegal human trafickking. and in thhis moment the defectant's past is mostly important than ever!\nAnothe reason why I agree with a jury should be given all the past facts are cases when the accused peron where slandered and because of missing few background details an innocent man might be convicted. In other words, in reason of unawarenes can interfere with judgement.\nOn the other hand, any personal problems cannot be presented as strong argument for acquittal of a crime.\nIn conclusion, having no access to the accused person's past facts is a big problem.

Some law representatives claim that this should be reverted, and the jury must be provided with this information beforehand. I fully agree with this statement since the jury will have a better understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final decision will be easier to understand for the audience.\nHaving the jury the right access to the defendant's past criminal background, would provide the jury with enough information about the defendant's behaviour. This is because there are certain previous criminal behavioural patterns which allow a better profesional decision-making from the part of the jury. For example, a recent study of the Law's Practice of Melboune, has shown that around 77% of people who commit a crime, were involved in at least one criminal event in the past with similar characteristics to the current crime.\nOn the other hand, if the jury has access to the defendant's past criminal history, it would be easier for the audience to understand the nature of the jury's final decision. This is because there have been cases in which the jury's final decision was not completely accepted by the audience or misunderstood. Therefore, providing the jury with enough criminal backgroud records of the defendant will make it clear to understand in beased of what or why the jury's final decision was made.\nIn conclusion, in the UK and Australia, a jury does not have access to a defendant's previous criminal records, and some law representatives claim that this should be reverted.

    "essay": "In the recent years, new companies are born and increase their competitive stregth in terms of employment more than ever. In response to the fast-evolving business industry, white-colared people may need an extra motivation than just having their profile featured with a big company. To my firm believe, the practice of encouraging employess through incentives or bonus is an effective way of maintaining the quality of work as well as another way to show appreciation to the seniors.\nTo my knowledge, this stlyle of management has been practicing for more than a decade, from small to large enterprises. The development of target acheivement or goal getter tactic is no surprise. We cannot deny the fact that money plays the most important part of cycling the world's economic and, of course, our everyday life. Hence, the most effective and easiest way to get people' hand on work is no where around but an extra sum of incentives or bonus from the company's annual benefits.\nThis hit hard to my personal experience. I realised the essence of it when I worked in a telesale company. I was offered a relatively medium-to-low basic salary which could not even yeild me any allowance after living cost reduction. However, I was fortunate enough to have a monthly incentive which would be evaluated solely on my performance each month. The evaluation was fair to the extent that I feel appreciated for what I work for.\nOn the contrary, if there were not given any incentives and were offered with something else as a reward, i.g. a free trip to somewhere, a couple of coupon vouchers, or even a car or house, I would still be ungrateful compared with the extra money earned every month. The reason is simply because stable income is considered more reliable than any other tangible or intagible assets, in the perspective of an employee. On top of that, the incentives and bonus can be increased yearly or quaterly based on the company performance.\nIn summary, I would like to reiterate that I agree on rewarding the emplyees with incentives and bonuses. Due to the fact that they can be as tool to build a strong montivation among the employees and deliver the company's gratitude toward them in an appropriate way.",

These days they are more likely to be motivated by prize money and the opportunity to be famous.What message does this send to young people and how does this attitude to sport affect the sports themselves?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
    "essay": "There were many sport competitions organized after the World-War II since the first Olympic games was held in Athena, in 1963, to bring the world together again. Previously, sport competition was seen as an opportunity for the athletes to break the world records for the pride of their home countries. However, nowadays, people are more inclined to win the match because of money reward and glory. I believe that young people should be more encouraged to achieve their goals to become a champion so that the value of sport competition would not be purely for commercial purpose.\nIn the last decades, there have been a lot of sport competitions being held from national to global level. The athletes were trained by the supported teams to do their best to become the world champion. It was the pride of such athlete to win and see their national flags were rised after the match. Over the years, sport has become more commercial following its popularity to attract global audiences. Many athletes are paying more attention for the opportunity to win the match for commercial purpose. For example, one wants to become a famous soccer player so that they could become the ambassador of Adidas and get more income out of it.\nDue to the temptation for getting famous and having more money, there are people who choose to play unfairly during a competition. Instead of focusing on increasing their skills, they would cheat to win the game for money. For example, a soccer player may use thyroid injection for boosting their energy level even though it is strictly prohibited. Moreover, sport is not seen anymore to promote peace and solidarity among people from different cultural backgrounds but for the chance to get the superficial gloriness.\nTo conclude, even if the motivation has shifted, the young people should learn to focus more on becoming a real champion and play fairly so that they can become the best athletes in thier expertise while the money and glory would follow them after.",

    "essay": "Generally, in our real lives, failure and successful events usually are seen in workplaces, sports and in families. Actually i completely disagree that the act of failing is caused by a lack of desire and motivation. There are many different factors which influence our failure and success.\nFirstly, the most recent event which affected significantly most of people's motivation, is the Covid-19 pandemic. The last two years there the number of business failure increased significantly due to lockdowns and victims by pandemic. For example the first lockdown in Europe happened in Italy in 2020, which restaurants, leisure facilities and shopping centres were obliged to close for more than one year. The consequence of this, was the loss of customers and the accumulation of debt, which led to many failures, because people had difficulties paying their bills and taxes.\nOn the other hand, failure could happen if people has no desire to expand their horizons. For example many developed companies that accept paying their employees larger amount of money, this action could cause laziness to company's members, even they could be absent from work. All that happens because of complacency. Consequently this can amount in dismissal and ruin their job's career and reputation in terms of work experience.\nTaking all of this into account, failure it doesn't only depend on peoples' personality and behaviour, but is also caused by external factors, influencing dramatically people's lives in terms of profit.",

    "essay": "Failure is what nobody wish for, but it could occur secondarily to an unsuccessful attempt towards ones goal, for various reasons. I am in the view that, failure is not a proof of lack of desire, rather it is more to do with improper techniques, less allocation of time and lack of proper attitude.\nIt is the general view that, ultimate success in any field is taught through the failures in life. One can be subjected to multiple failures due to lack of ability to develop essential skill set, also known as techniques, that would be essential to achieve a certain goal. One classic example is Thomas Alwa Eddison, the great inventor of all time, who went through nearly 100 unsucessfull experiments, before inventing the light bulb. He was brave enough to accept the failure experiments had taught him 100 different impossible ways not to discover the light bulb.\nOn the other hand, time plays one of the most crucial factors in obtaining a goal/success. By this I meant, the time that is allocated towards full filling tasks that are directed towards preparing for the goal. The little time is spent during the preparation, the further away the goal felt like. For an instance, one cannot expected to win a marothon with just one day preparation.Similarly, attitude plays by far the most striking part of the success. This is simple as, one cannot dream of becoming a good physician, having shown no interest in paying attention to people and their health related complaints.\nIn a nut shell, failure is not a proof for inadequate desire in fact, failure is due to improper practices of techniques,failure of managing time in preparing and attitudes that fires the drive.",

    "essay": "For centuries, artworks have been titled  'Work of Art' based on their extraordinary qualities. However, some people argue that nowadays, the standards are decreasing and the labelling of substandard artworks as 'masterpieces' has become ubiquitous. The upcoming essay will discuss why I agree that original paintings are being neglected while usual ones are being praised.\nFirstly, the superficial nature of humans is responsible for this change. These days, people do not see the meaning behind the painting or the message the artist is trying to convey rather they buy those paintings which are popular and contemporary. To illustrate it further, in art auctions it can be seen that when one person bids on one painting, no matter whether it is good or bad, others also start putting their money on it. Thus it is clear that normal art forms are winning prizes due to public attention.\nSecondly, some artists might bribe the organizers of exhibitions to promote their canvas. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances when artists were caught while signing up deals to increase the sales of their work. If a certain artwork receives publicity then it is impossible that it would not have an influence on the public. This type of promotion skews a person's opinion about a certain picture and so are forced to think about purchasing it, leaving behind original ones. Therefore, it is apparent that the diabolical activities of painters are responsible for their works being labelled as masterpieces.\nTo conclude, the maintenance of social position and influence of painters are the prime causes for the popularity of ordinary artworks and the negligence of true works. Hence I agree with the given statement.",

I agree in part. I agree that masterpieces are passing unnoticed but i disagree with the asertion that the production of prize-winning artwork is on the decline.\nAsk anyone who the fastest man on the planet is and anyone will mention \"Usain Bolt\". This is probably not wrong. However, Is it possible that a young man in a remote village in East Africa, who has never seen a car in his life and has been racing horses his whole life, could actually be faster than Usain Bolt? I believe so. The only issue is that Usain Bolt had a platform. In the same way there is probably some artistic genius somewhere, who doesn't have access to a plush gallery, who is creating breath-taking artwork. But alas, who is there to judge the mastery of his piece?\nWorks of art were probably easier identified in the past because there were so few great artists. Today we are drowning in them. It makes it hard to sift through the ordinary and the divine; diamonds in the rough. It appears that those who are heard are those who scream the loudest. That is why something as simple as a black circle drawn on a plain white canvas would be valued above a portrait of my grandmother painted with branches for brushes and ash and coal for paint.\nSocial media has come to give a voice to the voiceless and an opportunity to show the world true art in the most unlikely of places. But again, I ask, \"Who is the ultimate judge of what should be called a masterpiece?\" Until the right eyes see the work of these geniuses, royal hallways will continue to be lined by framed palm-prints.\nGreat art is not obsolete. Great art only needs a platform and a spotlight.",

    "essay": "In the past decades, there was a rapid increase in the use of road traffic in cities over the world as cities sprawl where cars become essential while transit, bicycling and walking become less practical. Commuting from home to work, shopping and going to school from place to place account for a higher sheer volume of traffic in the cities that is causing a thousand hundreds of problems, consisting of traffic jams and air pollution. Some people believe there is an enormous improvement in road traffic if the travelling needs for people across the cities are deducted. The governments play a vital role to figure out this issues.\nThere is no doubt that cities have spread out over larger expanses of land as builders have construced wide expressways and ample parking to accomodate motor vehicles. This tempts a large surge in car use and public transit use has fallen. A case in point is Los Angeles where traffic jams are a part of living. According to a survey in 2016, Los Angeles drivers spent an average of 104 peak drive-time hours fighting slow traffic. Michael G McNally, a professor at the University of California claimed that the poor public transit services was one key of factors in the congestion incident on the road of Los Angeles. This forces people to drive their cars to travel from place to place as there is no option to be chosen.\nHowever, improving public transport facilities alone is rarely considered enough to cope with the high volume in usage of the road traffic as the demand is still there. In recent years, the number of suburban hypermarkets ballooned in the cities, particularly in the developed countries, due to the high land cost in metropoils. Thereby, the amount of road traffic is sharply escalated in cities since people can drive their cars from home town to suburban or their destination. LA had an estimated 7.8 million registrations in population of 10 million in 2016 when New york just had 3.6 million registrations in population of 8.5 million. Car owners accounted for nearly 80% of population in L.A. This is highly likely that the car ownership is an vital reason for the busy road traffic. Reduction in numbers of car ownership is definitly one solution in the traffic congestion. By adopting policies to increase the car registration fee and to rise the parking cost, government can take one important step towards solving this problems.\nMy own view is that the travelling needs from place to place continuously increase in line with the development of metropolis. The high cost of parking and car registration fee combined with the 24-hour public transit system in cities can effectively limit the number of car ownership. This is a direct impact on the volume of road traffic over the cities.",

We know that traffic can be reduced if less consumers are using the roads. However, I dont agree that this is the only way to reduce traffic. Other strategies to reduce traffic are :\n1. Planning the roads and building the road bridges in a smarter way with special lanes for public transportation.\n2. Encourging people to use light trails, public transportations and to use car pools.\n3. Building special lanes for motorcycles and electric bikes.\n4. The governoment can put more regulations regarding how many cars each family can have.\n5. Increasing the vehicles prices and reduce the public transportation tickets.\n6. Educate people on the consequences of traffic and how it can inadverntly affect their life.\n7. Encourge people to walk more and to choose a work that is close to your home.\nAs I mentioned above there are many strategies that can help in reducing tranffic and only by reducing the need for people to travel from home.

    "essay": "Reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping will help us to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today.\nSpeaking about traffic problems, I always think about Moscow. No town I have ever been in has such a big trouble with road traffic. A huge quantity of public transport types, a few cars for one family, all of it creates a constant flow of traffic.\nOf course the increase popularity of IT-jobs and freelance helps people to spend more time home. The Home-office concept appeared relatively recently but a lot of people choose it already. I think after pandemic this type of work will be the only viable option.\nThe same situation is observed with education process. The almost a year pupils and students spend in Zoom and Skype.

    "essay": "While worldwide population is constantly increasing, globalisation implies that we concentrate more on cities and we travel more and further for work , leisure and education.\nAs a results any major city in the world is experiencing very dense traffic.This trend is now also being noticed in smaller cities too.\nIn order to reduce the amount of traffic, people should reduce their travel to work, education and shopping. At work that could mean working from home whenever it is possible, limitate the domestic and international business trip when not absolutely needed. Online studying could be generalized when the fied of study does not requires physical practice nor specific facilities. Since online shopping is becoming trendy we could change our habits and go on the web rather than in malls or in town in order to shop. The movement restrictions imposed during the covid-19, especially during the lockdown demonstrated that this is possible. However, during that period, most of us realized that this lack of mobility and travel freedom is not the best and is a heavy constraint, both personal and profesional.\nShouldn't we look for other alternatives in order to reduce the traffic ?\nIt is now well known buy all that using the public transportations is a great way to reduce the traffic. It is usually faster than using a private car and it is more eco-friendly. Even if it also has disadvantages such as the lack of timetable flexibilty, the lack of privacy, sometimes the price... it should be our prefered way of transportation whenever possible.\nCarpooling is another great way to reduce traffic. Wether it is for daily trips to work or week-end escapades, that is a great way to contribute to a limitate the numbers of vehicules on the road. Maybie governments should find incitative measures such as the one on some U.S highways, where carpools have access to express lanes while the private drivers who are alone in their cars have more restrictions.\nEven if our society is evoluting towards a very internet connected world where you can work, study and shop remotely, I think people might limitate their movement but won't stop travelling, whether it is long or short distance.\nInstead of keeping selling millions ( or maybie trillions of cars every year on earth ) government as well as individuals should rather rethink the way they move and transport themselves.",

    "essay": "In modern times, the younger generation appear to be more powerful and influencial compared to the generations in times past. I believe this is as a result of younger people being more ascertive, stepping up to question and change existing societal norms and archaic cultures. At first, this may negatively affect their relationship with the older generation as a result of how unfamiliar they are to these changes but subsequently, the tension is bound to resolve, when the older generations come to accept these changes.\nTo begin with, it is an open truth that young people these days tend to be very bold and outspoken and unlike their predecessors, are better at questioning norms that do not sit right with them and even going an extra mile to change these norms or cultures. A good example of this is seen in women empowerment and rights activism. In my part of the world, some years back, it was believed that a woman's place is in the kitchen and her sole job was to birth and rear children, therefore, women were not allowed to be educated or have paying jobs. Women in the older generation complied to this because it was the norm, but this is not the case in modern times, because many young women opposed to it and now, homes are even headed by women; the power of activism.\nMany people in the older generation are not familiar with young people being more outspoken and this is understandable because in their time, they were taught to only follow rules and not to question them. Therefore the fact that young people have become more outspoken and powerful is foreign to them and just like every human nature, whatever is foreign or different is automatically hated. As a result, there is likely going to be a tension between the 2 generations, however, with constant advocation and learning the tension is bound to resolve. For example, going back to women's rights activism, at the start, many older people were not on board as they did not think it was normal, however, there are now a lot of older people who have become activists.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the power and influence the younger generation has is as a result of their ascertiveness and will to effect changes in their societies and even though it may cause a negative relationship with the older generation at first, subsequently, their differences is likely to be ironed out when the older generation learns to accept these changes.",

    "essay": "It is believed that in today's society, young people have more ability to take control and give influence on the ever-changing world compared to those who were born in the past period. This is due to the mastery of using technology which overtake old people positions in many areas.\nThe young people in this era are able to take more advantages of using technology compared to the old generation, providing opportunities for innovation in an unconventional way and to increase income. For example, in the past, people were more engaged to TV programs and become passive consumers. However, because of the existance of YouTube, many young people can actively and creatively making contents such as cooking, music, or motivational videos and making it as a source of income. A YouTouber who have subscribers over than 30 million people such as Atta Hallilintar, for instance, has approximately more than 50.000 Euro income per month only by inviting people to watch his videos. Furthermore, by becoming a famous YouTuber, the person has a sigfinicant role as an influencer by showing his lifestyle, values, and even political views. He can also create new businesses such as food or clothing business, and it is easy to get into the market as followers will tend to be happily purchase items from their YouTube idol.\nDue to the advancement on technology, many old people have difficulties of following such trend and thus, they are easily left behind. Many of them are still working on their conventional way by not taking benefit of technology. For example, an old man who has a clothing store cannot use social media for marketing his business resulting to only attract local people to buy his items. This issue has limited the old generation to compete with the young people in terms of source of income.\nTo conclude, the young people have more control and ability to influence the global economic progression by replacing the conventional ways from the old generation and resulting them having less important positions in a global competition.",

    "essay": "Over the centuries, young people have always been following the path of the older generation, learning from them to one day become, once adult, the one leading the youngest. But it seems that it is changing in our modern world, young people now really have their word to say, are being heard and are influencing the whole society.\nInternet and generalised use of social media has had a huge impact on how people communicate, especially for the young generation. While our generation grew up without acces to internet, asking for informations to our parents, teachers... young people have access to all kind of knowledge and datas on the web. They can forge their own opinions easily and expose their ideas to the entire world throught internet. Then they can share these ideas and discuss with people from everywhere in the community or in the world , their point of view are taken into account because their voices are being heard widely through internet.\nMultinationals and marketing companies well understood that the young generation is the one giving the trend. They use all the data collected from the social networks to target the product that the youngest one are going to plebiscit. This underlines the fact that the taste and ideas of the young people are powerful and really are influencing the whole society in a large spectrum.\nSometimes, this is hard to accept for the oldest one who have been raised with a very diferent approach. In many countries, for a very long time, the oldest people, known as the one with the knowledge, were the one deciding, taking the decisions and showing the way. They were representing the authority and the power that very often young people would follow without questionning about the fact that things evolve and could be done in a very diferent way.\nHowever, we can learn a lot from the young generations. As they were born in world changing faster and faster they often are more resilient than we are and they probably fit better in that new modern world where adaptibility is a key to success. It makes them extremely powerful and influent, wether it is at work or at home.",

While its benefial effects is acknowledged, some people still believe that it has a negative influence on people and societies. In my opinion, the benefits of music to both individuals and societies outweighs its detremental effects. In this essay, however, I will discuss both points of views.\nTo start with, the fact that some people consider music a bad influcence is understandable especially when considering idolisation of musicians among young people. For example, the effect that the current world wide sensation Korean boy band, BTS, have on a lot of young people is unexplanable. Many youngsters have idolised this group to the extent where it affects their education and life in general. Definately, parents of children affected by this group will not be happy with their activities and will therefore develop negative feelings towards them. Furthermore, as many more young people lose focus because of their love for music and musicians, the society suffers in the long run because these people are less likely to be productive members of the society.\nMoving on, music also has a number of positive effects on people and societies. The first being that it is actually a lucrative source of livelihood for those involved and It also creats job opportunities. To explain further, musicians do not work alone, they need to be managed, they need a stylist, a make-up artist, song writers, graphic designers, to name a few and all these positions create an opportunity for young people to fill them. Furthermore, music is a good way to relax and calm one's mind. This method is even employed in therapy to aide the treatment or management of some anxiety disorders. Lastly, considering its effect on societies, the contribution of the music industry to a nations economy cannot be overlooked. Its contribution has always been tremendous and many times, important political figures have awarded musicians that have played a huge role in not only the economy of the country but her public image as well. For instance, very recently, the president of South Korea awarded BTS for their contribution, through their music, to the growth and international recognition of the country.\nIn conclusion, despite the controversy, in my opinion, the effect of music has more pros than cons on both individuals and societies because the industry not only creates job opportunities, music can also be used for the management of some mental health disorders and finally, it contributes a lot to a country's economy.",

    "essay": "People nowadays are living much longer.\nWith the discovering of new medicine and with the innovation in the medical field, the life expectancy of a person skyrocketed over the last decade.\nSome people might think that the consequence of this phenomenon should be the fact that the age at which people retire from work ought to be raised considerably.\nI don't agree with this idea.\nRather than involving the life expectancy of a person, we should consider the job itself.\nIs it tiring? Does it require a person to be able to react immediately to a potential problem?\nIf the job is tiring I think that it would be better for a person to retire. If you end up being worn out every day because your job is very exhausting the life expectancy should not be the fact that decides if you have or not the right to retire.\nThe question ought to be: Is the person physically and mentally able to cope with the work?\nThe older you get the slower you become. This is another pivotal factor that should be taken into account when deciding the retirement age of a person.\nThe ability to react to dangerous events keeps the working environment under control.\nLet's imagine a carpenter working on the construction of a new building.\nWhat if a wall suddenly falls? Does an elderly person react faster than a younger worker?\nI am an optimistic person but I would stick to my guns in this scenario betting on the younger person.\nI would like to wrap up this essay by saying that I could have thought of many more reasons that explain why the age at which people retire from work should not be based entirely on the fact that people are living longer.\nOf course, this can not be ignored but basing this decision only on this fact it is seen by me as a poor approach.",

    "essay": "Most of the citizens believe that, all countries should focus on producing more materials or items in their prime targets. Although some others think that, it is not a suitable target. I strongly agree with the idea of production and I will explain, why it is in this essay.\nFirst of all, countries should have a strong economy to survive and meet their citizenÃ¢ÂÂs expectations. And for the strong economy, they should produce new materials and do more researches to create new products and goods. So, governments should open new fabrics and research labs for the related sectors in order to create a big economy for their future. For example, they can give the opportunity to invent their own electronic vehicle in the country and this will allow everyone to buy it cheaper and easily instead of buying from other countries. Which is a best example of the importance of the new products.\nOn the other hand, some people believe that tourism and entertainment have big impact on the countryÃ¢ÂÂs economy. For example, even though Dubai is half desert nation, the government create a big tourism sector all over the world that everyone heard about the countryÃ¢ÂÂs name. Although, there are not any factories to produce materials or goods, but there are many entertainment actions such as Img world, legoland and many more inside the country. And these are working very well and taking attention of the other people for tourism purposes.\nIn conclusion, governments should give effort to produce and develop new products and goods for the countryÃ¢ÂÂs future. Although, they can also use the other opportunities to create a well economy for their people, such as tourism and the other sectors. But, in my opinion, they should have goals for more production and creation.",

    "essay": "Some think that the main objective of the countries should be the increment of production of materials and goods. I partially disagree that the constant increment in production is an appropiate goal becuase it has some negative consequences.\nThe idea of increasing constantly the production of materials and goods is based on the globalization process where each export and import goods and products, it is part of the globalise commerce. However, it is well-known that this practise represent negative aspects for the domestic economic and for the worldwide environment. For instance, in the free trade relationships between coutries, they negotiate the interchange of products, nontheless, in many times those trades produce a surplus or contrary a lack of products that increment the inflation or deflation of prices as a consequence of the invisible hand of Adams Smith that represent the offre and demand.\nAddiotionally, the extraction of some natural resources such as gold, coal and crude are affecting drastically our planet. Consequences such as global warming, and huge amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are depleting the ozone layer. Therefore, these practices of production should be executed with the purpose of fullfil the needs of the society instead of make of this a profitable source. For instance, Natural resources should be only extracted to produce energy rather than consumed products such jewelry and so on. if we do not control our production of materials and goods, some natural disasters and social issues such as poverty and hunger will keep affecting human beings negatively.\nIn conclucion, although some people consider that each country should increment its production of raw materials and products as a main goal, I strongly believe that it is crucial to stablish a balance between this objective and others that affect our ecosystem and equity.",

    "essay": "Numerous experts think that every country should be capable to produce more materials and commodities. I agree with this argument as it brings benefits to countries and I will highlight some of them.\nTo begin with, manufacturing goods is essential to any country as it helps to build their economy. Increasing production power assist them to export more and it also makes them less dependent on other countries. For instance, China is one of the largest producers in the world in any goods which also makes them the largest exporter. Such development in production power contributes to their gross domestic product.\nAnother reason is that extra produced goods can be used in emergencies, such emergencies are pandemics, financial crises and many more. By growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production. For example, there is a semiconductor chip crisis is going on all over the world and no country in the world is able to meet the demands of chips. On the contrary, India is now planning to satisfy the demand for chips by strengthening its manufacturing capacity to a massive level while it will directly contribute to their economy and also generate job opportunities.\nTo conclude, I agree that more in-house production is necessary. It is extremely crucial to produce more needed products in order to consistently outperform the rest of the world and also it brings many beneficial things like generating job opportunities and a rise in the Gross domestic product of a country.",

Not at all.\nConsumerism is predominant in these areas and thus these countries should reduce their productions.\nMost of the things they use daily are useless and they serve as amusement. I firmly believe a person can live perfectly without having 5 different cars.\nIn my opinion, the fact that a country should aim at increasing its production of materials and goods has another leak that I have briefly mentioned before: a higher level of production would lead inevitably to a higher level of pollution that would be consequently released into the natural environment.\nEath is already facing some very important issues when it comes to problems related to pollutions.\nLastly, I think that we should focus on how to produce less or, at least, on how to produce the same amount of goods and materials but in a more environment-friendly way.",

    "essay": "The view of how much goods and natural resources a country should produce differ massively. Some people are the view, that countries should increase their production and that this is an appropriate aim. I strongly believe, that countries should not increase their production of such goods and resources.\nFirstly, the market will tell countries how much of these resources are needed. Therefore, the need of constantly enlarge their production is not necessary and additionally, a negative aspect can be, that companies will not be able to sell their products. By regulating production, countries areto make their products expensive if there is a high demand or cheaper if there are not enough buyers. For instance, if much steel for construction is needed, the countries which exploit that resource will be able to ask for a higher price.\nFurthermore, countries with many natural resources can't access their goods at any time due to lack of machinery or power and workforce. For example, during the pandemic, many Chinese companies have been working in low mode. Now, that various countries have started to open up, China can not keep up with the demand and produce all the goods due to a power shortage, indeed. This development will bring many severe consequences for the local and international economy.\nOn the contrary, by growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production, they can also make harm to the environment which will bring numerous consequences such as waste water pollution, high emission levels.\nIn brief, despite some short-term economic incentives, I strongly believe, as stated in the paragraphs above, that the need for that increase in goods and resources is not necessary.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, it seems that the goal of every nation should mainly focus on economic purposes such as increasing production of materials and goods. However, I personally believe there are more important things than the economy, which governments should pay more attention to. For example, health systems, education, fundamental rights etc. Despite this, in my opinion, production should be also a main goal but it is also crucial for the well-being of the country, to make a balance among all objectives.\nOn the one hand, countries rely on the economy in order to make money, provide people with jobs and make a way of living. So I believe production of material and goods is essential in every economy. Nevertheless, constant increasing of production is not very healthy for the country, as it may end in a surplus of goods and materials. Moreover, the situation could get worse if companies would not know what to do with all the excess products.\nOn the other hand, taking care of inhabitants of a certain country is as important as producing. Without health, education and values, most nations would not survive. I also believe that you cannot have a strong economy without a healthy population, as people are the ones that work in production. In other words, both aims complement each other perfectly.\nAs a conclusion, I would like to highlight the fact that constantly increasing production does not benefit anyone, it also may harm people. And governments should be more aware of other complex issues like the ones mentioned above.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, more and more people have started to do shopping online. In my opinion, buying products such as books, clothes or air tickets on internet have a lot of advantages that could balance the disadvantages.\nFirstly, one of the positive aspect is that online it is possible to compare the same product at different prices in order to chose the best deal. Furthermore, we have the possibility to buy in a faster way, without wasting time and finding the best article. Indeed, in local shops it isn't always possible to find what we are searching for, while in the large shopping centre the research of the right thing takes time and it isn't so easy.\nAnother advantage of shopping on the Internet is that in a single website, such as Amazon, you can find multiple types of product, from book to clothes or furniture. In this way you can buy different things without spending too much time moving from one place to another.\nOn the other hand, buying online could have some disasvantages. For example, on the shopping websites there are lots of spam messages that offer you products at special prices. This kind of offerts are very attractive and make you to buy things that you really don't need. Also, not all the online platforms are secure and there are a lot of hacker that could steal your personal details.\nIn conclusion, I think that the advantages of shopping online outweigh the disadvantages, but we have to pay attention and chose carefully the websites in which spending our money in order to avoid problems.",

    "essay": "The way in which we dress has always been under a social relevance we cannot avoid. Since the antiquity clothes showed the difference social status of people and now they are a way in which person can show her personal attitudes. It is difficult to valuate the role of clothing in work places. On the one hand, there are organisations that strongly believe that the employees must dress in a peculiar, smart way. On the other hand, there are work places in which how people who worked there are dressed does not matter.\nAlthough I believe it is important to be dressed in the right way with respect with different social moments, I strongly insist that a person must not be judged because of her syle.\nOrganisations who require a particular dress code in the work place, are moved from the idea that the way in which you are dressed show your personality more than you can imagine. In particular, they believe that to ask people to be smartly dressed will present the organisation itself as serious and reliable. Moreover, in some work-place the heads insists in requiring a style that will not say a lot about the personal attitudes of the employees. Then, to have a particular skirt or to wear a fency pair of shoes will show up the particular attitudes of a person and this could be evaluated as a weakness by different managers. For instance, there are offices in which all the employees has to wear suit and tie if men and skirt and heel if they are women. However, sometimes this way of acting cause troubles and emotional deseases that can affect the employees who are not confidend in wearing clothes that respect that particular dress-code. One of the most famous case in Italy concered the flight company Alitalia who asked the woman empoyees to always wear the skirt. Just after several strikes they obtained the permit to wear also pants.\nOn the other hand, there are organisations in which how employees are dressed does not matter at all. They believe the skills possessed by the workers go beyond a particular pair of shoes. To take another example, the skills of an employee have nothing to do with the color of her hair. Places like this consider a point of streengh the emotional and personal attitudes of the workers as well as they strongly believe that to show personal attitudes in a work context can give a major value to the work itself. Then, they decide to leave free people to dress as they want without any restriction.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the tendency to rule the way in which people should be dressed in the work place must be operated with high awarness. the CEO of an agency can propose an office syle without compromise the particular attitudes and feelings of the employees.",

Some companies give the opinion that their workers should have a smart look while others consider the attitude toward the job more important.\nTo my mind, appearance should not the only thing to be considered. We can dress smartly and impress others, but it is only the first impression. Therefore, productivity, quality of work, and the way we are responsible for our tasks are things that make us outstanding workers. Moreover, it is obvious that the success of one company does not depend on how its employees dress but on how it is organized.\nIn spite of the fact that dressing does not play a key role in the value of a worker, a neat and intelligent appearance still gives us significant benefits. I always suggest that one should dress suitably in different situations. In fact, it is not crucial for an organization to ask their employees to dress formally, but a set of smart casual clothes is something that we should wear when it comes to the working environment. It is because that wearing politely shows how we respect our jobs, our employers, and even our workmates. In some cases, a company's professionalism can be seen through the way its workers wear.\nTo sum up, dressing smartly is not the best and only thing that one worker can do to have better performance. However, having a good appearance is something that great employees would do since it can be considered as their respect for the jobs.",

For this reason, attention should be given to colour schemes when decorating places such as offices and hospitals.How true is this statement?How far does colour influence peopleÃ¢ÂÂs health and capacity for work?",
    "essay": "The role of colors in our psycological life is crucial. Some people suggest hence to pay attention on color schemes when workplaces or hospital are decorated. I agree that colors affect people's psychological health. A particular place's decoration can arouse a determinate feeling that could favour or penalise the capacity of people in a work place.\nColors affect our psycological life. They possess an extraordinary social role. It is not a case that the famous table of emotions is presented in different colors where the different colors represent different emotions. For instance, blue incline people to be sad while red is said to be the color of passion, and move strongly the emotions of a person by setting of her pleasures. Lastly the grey's shades stimulate anxiety. Therefore, I think that the hospital's walls or officies cannot be decorated in grey or blue as long as it is better to stimulate their positiveness and productivity. Thre is a curious story about Princess Sissi, that confirm the impact of color in our life. She was obsessed about her wight and fitness. For this reason, she decored purple all the walls of her appartmanets. Indeed, pourple is said to be the color which stimulates the absence of hunger. Thus, when the princess was there it was easier for her to be fast.\nBy contrast, there are also some colors that stimulate fantasy, creativity and peace. Green is one of that color. Then, to decorate hospitals with green shades could be a good way to produce positive vibes in people who are sicks. Moreover, yellow is defined as the color that describes the feeling of being proud, aware and confident. Then, using this color in the walls of the officies will stimulate workers to do their better. Their capacity in the work-place will be maximased by the general environment.\nIn conclusion, I believe that colors affect our psychological life and then people should pay attention in the feelings they stimulate when they decore a room or a building intented to welcome a particular type of people like sicks people or workers.

    "essay": "Improving technology is the tendency of the era right now. Information technology is one type that has already changed a lot from the past. Information technology influences our daily life in many areas, such as home, leisure, and work activities. It positively affects human life, but it also has its disadvantage. I will give my opinion about how information technology influences our lives and the information technology has more benefit or cause more detriment.\nInformation technology improves human life in many different areas. First, it reduces the difficulty of communication. The technology we have right now gives us a faster and easier way to communicate with other who is far from us. Right now, whether we use social media or email, we can contact the people who are far from us immediately. The second part is information gathering; right now, we can get news everywhere, just on electronics, such as cell phones and TV. Also, information technology helps humans in information storage and process. This is the advantage of information technology.\nInformation technology significantly improves human life, but it also has some disadvantages. The first thing is to reduce the time people commute together face by face. Nowadays, classes, meetings, and work can all go online. As a result, we have less chance to meet and communicate; this reduces the ability to watch others' behavior and expression to speculate their feeling and emotion. The second disadvantage is that convenient technology lets people rely on it too much and reduces our ability to finish jobs without technology.\nIn my opinion, the advantage of information technology has way more influence on human life than the disadvantages. First, it helps us solve our problems with more accessible and faster information. This meets the fast rhythm of life in this era. Also, information technology may let people rely on it, but this is very general for humans because we always use anything we can use to solve problems quicker and more efficiently. This is how information technology influences our life.",

    "essay": "There is no doubt that these days information technology has invaded our space and dominated our home leisure and work. However, the question: is dominating our lives by this technology have a negative or positive impact on our lives? Is considered one of the most controversial issues today. In this essay, I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints.\nOn one side of the argument, some people argue that the benefits considerably outweigh the disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is integrating technology in every aspect eases our lives and decreases hardworking. For example, advanced houses with integrated voice commands give the person the ability to achieve multiple tasks without any physical activity. Moreover, the technology allows people to connect multiple devices with an email address and control them remotely. One good illustration of that you can switch on and off your home AC while you are at work by the WIFI technology.\nOn the other hand, it is also possible to consider it with the opposing case. It is often argued that in fact using advanced technology increase the number of unhealthy people. People often have this opinion because people become lazier, and their daily activity dramatically decreases making them prone to diseases.\nAs we have seen, there are no easy answers to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that using advanced information technology should be limited to simple tasks, so at any point if a technical error happened you can resume your life without any obstacles.",

    "essay": "With the growing prevalence of information technology, it gradually dominates every aspect of our daily lives. While it is admittedly true that when used inappropriately, technology may expose us to a host of dangers and thus complicate our lives, it is, however, necessary for us not to overlook the benefits of technology to society. Given that technology changes many factors of our lives, I strongly believe that the advantages of it outweigh the disadvantages.\nIn terms of mobile phones bringing people closer together, these technological devices enable people to stay in touch no matter where they are. In the past, when people have to use telephones to contact with each other, is now replaced with social media, which is a convenient alternative for communication. For instance, smartphone applications such as email or WhatsApp, an instant messaging service, help people in different parts of the world interact with one another. Therefore, wireless communication networks facilitate communication and make people's lives easier and more convenient.\nRegarding time efficiency, computers are an expendient way for people to find information instantly. Comparing to the past when people spends hours a day in a library to look for information using books, we can surf the Internet now. As an example. Wikipedia is an online, open-source encyclopedia that lets people browse for factual knowledge, and SCMP.com is a website which lets people catch up on the latest news. Conversely, if people carelessly use the Internet, they will result in discovering false messages, which readily mistaken their perspectives.\nHaving discussed that information technology certainly modifies our daily lives, as well as the drawback of it, if people can use technology properly, I am confident that technology will better streamline people's daily schedules.",

They help us to connect with the people around the world and collect information in a high speed. On the other hand, it would makes us lazy if rely on them too much. In this essay, I will explain how we can benefit from information techonology so we can outweigh its drawback.\nHumans are social creatures and technology is helping us to socialize with others world-wide. Computers and the internet are the two products of technology that we use to connect with our friends, families and people. Despite where we live in, in today's world, we are able to talk with our friends almost anytime we want it. As a person who lives abroad, this advantage of technology makes my life a lot easier and helps me to feel less homesick.\nFurthermore, with the improvements in technology, we are able to find the information that we looking for online and this would take possibly less than a minute. Search engines such as Google and Yahoo, is very helpful in this case. We can search the information in these platforms rather than going to public libraries, and they would provide in a short period. This speed can help us to improve and gain more information.\nHowever, we can find ourselves at our offices or homes, sitting in front our laptop all day and completing our tasks with a little effort. This habit would makes us lazy and inactive people. Our metabolism needs certain amount of excersise in order to burn calories and not gain fat. Addiction to technology, would take this need away and might cause an harmful health conditions in the future.\nTo conclude, technology addiction can promote the unhealthy life. However, I believe advantages such as speed of gaining information and providing a platform to connect people, eleminates its drawback.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, a good number of universities make their courses available online for people to study, which I believe its a positive step for many reasons, such as, spreading knowledge worldwide and providing free materials for students.\nIt is widely acknowledged that the internt can be a useful tool for learning. Taking advantage of the fast and variable resources and tools, many universities upload courses and materials in diverse fields of knowledge on the internet, so that any human anywhere can attend these courses and gain the information and expertise needed. For instance, anyone can attend a course from Harvard university and even acquire a certain degree online without having to travel to that university.\nFurthermore, providing free online courses can contribute significantly to the society, by allowing students with low income families to be part of the educated community. Thus permitting more contribution to the world. A good example is the health care, psychology, and business courses given by Stanford university helped many people get their degree and be part of the workforce in these fields without paying expensive tuition fees.\nIn conclusion, permitting the knowledge to be widely available online is a useful development, as it will allow more individuals worldwide to access informations, and also by providing free courses to serve community by serving its poor citizens get their educational degrees.",

    "essay": "Universities are offering many online courses for the convinience of people. Although online courses can never substitute the regular education, some benefits of online courses are undeniable. This essay will discuss both the advantegs and disadvantages of study through the internet.\nPrima facie, education through internet has far more reach than any other method. Universities can approach students from all over the world, even a student from a remote area can be benefitted through the revolutionary internet courses. Online courses are also considered to be cost effective because a student can study from the comfort of home and save lot of living expenses.\nWhile remote education reaches many students, it lacks in many ways. A physical classroom exeperience gives a student far more learning than the online one. Some practical subjects like Medical Science and Science require a lab facility and presence of students in the classroom environment. Theories can be still taught online but practical education is not feasible. Attending college also provides many mental health benefits, students connects with fellow studenst and teachers and create a social circle which in return result in healthy conversations and meeting. An healthy and happy environment is significant and helps people learn more quickly. Moreover a regular college education comes with many extra curricullar activities like sport, drama, music etc. I can never forget my college days where I enjoyed many youth festivals and sports event which helped in developing overall personality. Colleges provied many other benefit like socail gathering and focus on behaviroul aspect of students as well.\nIn a nutshell though online education comes with some good feature but can never replace the physical/regular education system.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, many universities allow people to follow some courses and study totally online. In my opinion, this way of studing has both positive and negative aspects. This essay will argue why studing online can be unproductive for people.\nThe first reason why studing online is not good for a student is that is easier for him to lost the concentraiton during a lecture. For example, last year beacuse of the pandemic period, all students had to get class online, including me. It was a terrible year, because I stayed at home all the time and became very difficult listening lectures due to lot of things that capture my attention during lessons.\nThe other reason why getting class on the internet is a negative development is that the direct interaction between people is absent. I feel that this is the biggest drawback, because students are always alone in their room and they could become unsocial over the time. By contrast, the social life is important for everyone, because it help people to grow and share good and bad moment of the life. In addition, I think that is also important the dialoge with the teacher.\nIn conclusion, studing online can be a good solution for some people who need to stay at home and want to study at university, but in general it's a negative thing. In fact, is important for students to stay in a class with the teacher and other classmates to be concentrate during a lesson and to have the possibility to talk face to face with other people.",

As we reasonably assume, not all the lessons the are structured in the same way therefore result difficult to migrate all of them in an online version which present the same format and structure of presentation.\nAlthough online courses, most probably, are the future of teaching some lessons require fisical activity. To reinforce my position against the full online courses, I have a personal example: I've parteciapated at one course called Organic farming which require from time to time a fiscally presence in the field. Therefore result quite complicated for me aptended a lesson about beekeeping without be next to the hive, this is happened to me not long ago, we were unable to attend the lesson because of the COVID restrictions.\nRegardless the effort of the professor to address the lesson as best as he could, the resoult was not totally satisfy for me.\nIn conclusion I want to confirm my position against the online version of theacing, maybe I'm a bit old fashion and I can't see the future but I still like the classics lectures at the university with debates confrontations with others students and live the actmosphere of the university not from a screen.",

In the essay I will discuss how can we decrease the effect of climate change.\nFirst of all, climate change caused by different reasons for example waste production by factories which is released in rivers and oceans.\nAlso carbon monoxide released by cars and other types of transportion. Also, community behiover such as use of plastic and non-recyclabe materils.\nSecondly, we can as community reduce the effect of climte change on our enviroment by different ways. One of them is taking puplic transportion insted of using our own cars. In the matter of transportion, walking or using bicycles are the best for the climte because there is zero carbon monixide release. Moreover, replace the plastic bags with reusable ones will reduce the amount of waste.\nIn addition, goverments couled set rules and laws to control the amount of waste released in the enviroment. In Addition, planting more trees will have positive impact on the earth since they release more oxygen.\nHowevere, climte change is unavoidable result of our current actions. If we continue to act in the same ways the earth will be destroyed by the pullution.

    "essay": "Many individuals suggest the society must take actions to live with the global warning rather than to avoid environmental-related issues as climate change. I fully disagree that people think it is better to develop technology to live with rather than try to decrease and solve the climate change.\nIn my opinion, if human could think about a way to live with climate change, it means that they have already thought, they failed to repared damages of global warming. Everyone should reduce their greenhouse gases thanks to their actions as wasting less, taking more public transports or stopping overconsumption. Even if local scale is a significant part to decline climate change, there are also governments and corporations which should decrease their polluting actions. Moreover, it is not as it could not work because during Covid's period when each country minimized its actions, the climate change slumped back and it is essential even crucial.\nFuthermore, if people suggest to find a way to live with it, it illustrates that the entire Earth's planet could be collasped or may be destroyed. It depicts a negative perception of our forthcoming living's environment.\nI am convinced this environment is not the quality of life that I would share to my offspring. If I had the power to solve the climatic issues, I would do everything I can and offer a better condition and prosperity of a healthy environment to the next generation.\nTo conclude, I extremely disagree to think about living with the climate change instead of solving it.",

    "essay": "In recent years, climate change became a conflicting issue for some people. as some think coping with it istead of prevent its happen could be more reasonable. However, others think the opposite, prevention of the climate change is essential. This essay will discuss why coping with climate change can be reasonable? .\npreventing climate change have been priority number one in recent years. Whearase, the focus has been always in preventing or reducing the problem which is sound unrealistic. Many theories and predections of the issue start happening in these years for example, Floods, ice melt in the antarictic and extermely hot summers. So, talking about prevention is is away too late.\nHowever, thats why finding a way to live with climate change sounds reasonable. I believe, plan out a futuristic cope for the next generation will be more applicable than, start to prevent essentials that helped in buiding the civilization. For instance, gas factories, greenhouses and oil. However, reducing the impact of these products is a good idea, hence not shut it down.\nTo conclude, climate change is a series issue need a good attention and not that attention promoting lately. promoting to prevent something already happening is impossible. This issue need a reasonable realistic plan that make living with it more easier and effective.",

    "essay": "Global warming is affected by different things being agriculture,human activity ,technology and many more. some argue that instead of preventing it people should find means to survive along with it. I completely disagree and will state side of my view.\nThe reason why some people hold to this argument is because global warming is difficult to control. For example, there are no control measures on second hand cars bought in Botswana people end up buying old damaged cars. Consequently they end up emmiting smoke and have an impact to the climate. Other reason is, people they do not follow polices implemented by the government making it hard to prevent harm to climate. For instance, policy made in Botswana that people should get permits to cut trees but instead they do that without them. Above reasons are good enough to people to think that they\nshould find ways to live with global warming issues instead of preventing them.\nNethertheless, I beileve global warming can be preventable and cannot be accepted because it is harmful. It can damage our eco system. Reason being,people cutting treess will lead to less of them thus more carbon dioxide in the climate which is harmful to survival. Also it can lead to less rainfall being produced, resulting to less food being produced and no water. Therefore flora and fauna will suffer as well as human beings. Lastly due to climate change it can happen that the sun will burn plants in farms, that is less food produced then people will suffer. The government should put policies in place and make sure people abide by them to prevent global warming.\nTo conclude, though some people believe to find ways to survive with climate change I am against that as the damages caused by it are of more significance. Climate change needs to be prevented by all means as it is dangerous to eco system and government should find strict laws to save it.",

    "essay": "Whilie some people believe that we can live with climate change instead of dealing with that, I don't agree with this idea because climate change can bring various disadvantages for our life.\nThere are many disadvantages of climate change which can gradually push animals and also human to extinction. First and foremost, climate change promote the process of global warming which is one of the most dangerous result of climate change. Because of this situation, ice in 2 polar areas is melting day by day. As a result, the level of sea water will go up. Therefore, countries which are near by the sea may be drown in the future. Another drawback of climate change is that it causes many disaster. The figure for disaster is predicted to increase because of climate change. Hence, people and animals will have to deal with many dangerous disaster which can bring a lot of damage.\nBeside, I believe there are also many way to prevent climate change. Firstly, from my perspective, education is the best way to deal with the changing of climate. Because education raises the awareness of people about how dangerous climate change is, and it also teach people to protect the environment. Therefore, the effect of climate change will decrease. Secondly, local community should hold more volunteer activity for people to clean the palace where they live, so people can make sense of environmental protection and their neighborhood will also be cleaned. This activity can also contribute to prevent climate change\nIn conclusion, I believe that people can't live with climate change and people have to prevent it.",

While some people believe that we should take actions to prevent its affects, others think we better understand it and do some adjustments in our lives accordingly.

Humans faced serious natural disasters in the past and climate change was just one of them.

From this prespective, today's changes in climate change can be accepted and with a few adjustment in our life styles, it can be treated as another disaster in history that humans have been through.\nHowever, if we do changes to learn live with climate change, it will cause us to drop our life quality in daily bases. For instance, air pollution will become a huge problem with the climate change and if we just adapt ourselves to live with it, we have to wear face masks everyday to reduce its harmful affect to our metabolism and this will limit our breathing. On the other hand, if we try to prevent climate change, we can keep the same way that we are living today. Furthermore, if we take serious actions to stop climate change, we have a chance to raise our life quality not just for today but also for the future.

    "essay": "In numerous countries, few individuals earn a considerable income. Despite the outrageous salary that people could have, many consider that government ought to submit a limit of wages. However, others believe that is profitable for their nation.\nThinking to all poverty that there are in the world, I can understand why some individuals estimate to not allow indecent wages. In my opinion, a larger number of people who earn significant salaries always waste their money into useless luxuries to show off. However, when we can see some household which have numerous jobs to keep the wolf from the door, it seems obvious that governments should impose restrictions on income. In addition, even if individuals sometimes deserve their wages, if government had their billions which are in their bank accounts, it would help millions of inhabitants for numerous issues. It could benefit to the general interest, namely, to reduce starve, poverty or even maybe find a cure for cancer.\nNevertheless, I would say that individuals deserve their salaries because most of the time, people who earn a considerable living create employment such as Chief Executive Officer. Thanks to their ingenuity and their leadership, this small number of geniuses build corporation which give to thousands of persons a full-time job. Indeed, citizens must not forget that everyone pay taxes hence, for example, if a businessman had a heavy income, he would pay higher taxes than everybody. Furthermore, this gap between salaries could also be justified due to different level of studies or responsibility which lead to distinct income.\nTo conclude, even if in each country, there are heterogenous wages with a huge gap, each view is completely understandable.

    "essay": "In many parts of the world, few people get a lot of money thanks to their job. It is believed by some that this is an advantage for the country, while it is thought by others that governments should put a limit above which salaries cannot be.\nIn my opinion, I believe that not only people have to be rewarded for their performance, but also their wage salary has to be proportional to the benefits that they are leading to the country.\nFor instance, due to the Covid a lot of people suffered several injuries which were cured only thanks to the doctors and the nurses. For this reason, since they are saving lifes everyday,\nit seems unbelievable the fact that they are earning much less money than football players.\nAnother example can be found in people involved in the national security: I believe that it would be fairer if these professionals were paid more than an influencer.\nHowever, in our society this figures (such as doctors) are paid by governments through taxes, while football players or influncers gain incomes by private companies.\nIn order to not impose an heavier taxation, politics should categorise jobs basing on their importance in the society. Hence, we will have a specific amount that these employers can earn.\nThus, if these no-fundamental workers (like actors or actress) are earning more money than the precise level chosen, these will be used as funds to increase life-saving jobs' salary.\nIn conclusion, I believe that highest salaries should exist only if we are referring to a job that is needed by everyone.",

Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
    "essay": "As society becomes more and more saturated with technology, traditional cultures are losing their roles in society. The compatibility of technology and traditions are often debated where some suggest it is possible, whereas, others argue it is not. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and conclude by saying how and why it is almost impossible.\nSince people usually appreciate limited ways of living, it is challenging for both conventions and technology to co-exist. They will usually choose one method or another but not both at the same time. For instance, a company would have to focus on using human labour or advanced machineries to produce a product. The incompatibility may not be obvious at first but as technology develops futher, use of machines will increase but employment will decrease. Furthermore, technology is often considered to be more convenient and faster by many people. Work can be done more efficiently so workers will start to abandon the old ways of living or working.\nIn contrast, it might be possible for two values to work along in society due to different tastes of various people. Traditional cultures are usually appreciated by old generation such as grandparents, meanwhile, new generation prefers technology in their life. For example, grandparents can read newspaper while grandchildren watch TV or play games during family time. Moreover, although it is hard for a company to use both at the same time, it is not totally impossible. If the number of machines is controlled during production, human labour and machines can work together to maximise productivity by covering up each other's disadvantages.\nAll in all, even though traditional values and technology can be compatible theoratically, it is indeed difficult to compromise the use between two in real life. Ergo, people would have to beware of the risk of losing traditional cultures, if at all.",

    "essay": "Many people hold the view that traditional culture and technological development cannot coexist as the latter catch on, the former will be bound to disappear. I totally disagree with this because both can be implemented jointly by putting technology at the service of tradition and through pilot projects.\nTo begin with, technological progress, which is making major strides in our daily lives, is the means by which local mores, custom and traditions could be brought back to life, proving they are compatible. In fact, by tapping technology to make tradition far more attractive, considerably more audience will be engaged into such activities. Bologna is a case in point, since, thanks to digital machines and drones which have supported housewives into the making of , the traditional celebration of Ã¢ÂÂmaking pasta day Ã¢ÂÂ has recently being turned into a successful events, which draws people from country as far afield as China.\nAnother example of possible coexistence is the possibility to heighten awareness of people costumes through the creation of pilot projects which bring both habits and technology to a new whole level. This can be put into practice by setting a direct connection to cultural heritage of a specific area of the world to those who do not have access easily. To this end, many primary schools in New York have developed a project in which, owing to the ultimate high speed connection, pupils who come from abroad can learn ancient craft directly from a master located in their country of origin.\nTo conclude, I firmly believe that traditional culture and technology development are widely compatible as the technology can positively beef up the presence of cultural traditions nowadays, so as to keep its memory Alive. In addition, pioneering projects can be implemented to underpin cultural awareness amongst youngsters.",

The author agree with the statement that the technology and traditional cultures may find it hard to co-exist. As the reserach and development of human beings increases the birth of new technologies are inevitable. When a new technology is invented, mostly the new member of our living environment disrupts the traditional standards.\nFor example, prior to the internet era we used to communicate less through the mobile devices and tend to have face to face conversations. This is often true while considering a chat between our family members. On occasions like birthday, a festival season like Christmas we used to go in person to greet the loved ones. However, as technology evolved and traditional jobs are swept away people migrated to locations with more opportunities and often these are far from the native places. This situation along with the communication platforms built above internet like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat make us feel like we do not have to travel so far just to wish for a special occasion when we can do the same easily on a mobile device.\nFrom the authors experience it is clearly understood that he traditional cultures are now covered by the clouds of new technologies which threatens the survival of many hunam beings. For example, with the innovation in the banking sector, the customers are now able to transact through their mobile application. They do not have to visit the brick and mortar braches anymore. If this trend continues then many professionals in the banking industry will be laid of within next couple of years.",

    "essay": "The relationship between modern technology and traditional culture has always been a great concern of many. Some people argue that, they both can not go well each other on side and I completely agree with statement. In this essay, i will explain how technology affects a culture in a bad way.\nFirstly, media has played important part in damaging to cultures in the world. Next to that, modern technology has more advancement in telecommunication department that turned the world into global village. Furthermore, whatever is available in one corner of the world can easily found in another one , so that, it is damaging the uniqueness of any area. People more prefer to eat western food compare to traditional hence, country's street market has also need to change in their favours and cuisine. More and more people in Asian countries, for example, are copying the styles of American outfits and street foods in India are widely replaced by KFC and Mcdonalds. Hence, media play a crucial role in culture to become less distinctive.\nOn controversy, while development in technology makes people life easier, it also changed the way we live. The introduction of new appliances like the microwave and electric grill has radically changed the traditional cooking. People no longer spend time in kitchen to make food for themselves as they were used to do before. In addition, development in travel and tourism can much affordable to travel in other countries and one can be easily explored the world by advance facilities. Everytime, when a tourist visits a country, they bring with it own culture and it leaves some impression on the local people. For example, a great number of people in India started wearing jeans after the development of tourist attraction in the area. Hence, the link between the evolution of technology and culture damage can be seen.\nIn conclusion, I totally agree with the statement that while technology brings comfort to life , it makes the cultures vague and indistinctive.",

    "essay": "In today's world, extreme sports are getting popular among people like sky diving and skiing. It is an adrenaline rush sport where people step beyond their limits. In my opinion, such sport should not be banned just because they are dangerous.\nFirstly, such extreme sports should not be banned as they are also sport just like any other sport. furthermore, major sports like cricket are also not the safest to play as the ball is made of solid leather it can put crack on someone's head which is extremely dangerous. extreme sports are meant for enjoyment and they also help to release some stress.\nSecondly, if such sports are conducted properly then it should not be as dangerous like there should be guidelines where they make sure that pieces of equipment are in excellent condition and where they do make sure a safety check.\nLastly, despite being extreme, many find themselves indulging in such activity because it helps them reduce their stress at work or home. The reason is that when we engage in sports, our body releases oxytocin, a hormone that alleviates stress and helps us feel more relaxed and peaceful unlike when we are bombarded with phone calls or emails from clients.\nIn conclusion, I disagree with the eradication of extreme sports as it provides thrills and also boosts someone's confidence as they move beyond their limitation. people all around the world love to indulge in such activities where they feel an adrenaline rush in their whole body.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, practicing extreme sports like sky diving and skiing is much more popular than in the past. Anyway, a lot of people think that this types of sports are very dangerous and should be banned. This essay will talk about extreme sports giving my own opinion about the idea of banning this activities because of their risks.\nPracticing a sport is very important for the general health of a person; a lot of people choose to practice dangerous sports, like skiing, because of the adrenaline and the sensation that it brings to you. Sports of this type can help you to go over your fear and they will help you to see life from a different perspective.\nAnyway, the risks that an athlete will go through are many; every year the amount of people that have injuries or, sometimes die, because of this types of activities are numerous. Especially with skiing, a person should never go alone in places that don't have the right equipment to guarantee a safe experience; many times when practicing this types of sports, athletes from all over the world decide to go over their limit going to practice in zones that are known to be dangerous or unsafe and, in this cases, the possibility of something bad to happen is high.\nPersonally, I think that when you want to practice or experiment a sport that is extreme you should take all the right prevention to make the experience as safe as possible to avoid any injuries. Practicing sports is important but it is also fundamental to try your best to avoid injuries when practicing it. This essay talked about extreme sports and their risk, giving my own opinion at the end.",

    "essay": "Nowardays, it widely believed that most people have forgotten the main purpose of some traditions and religious celebrations, but during those festival periods they just prefer to enjoy themselves and have a fun from holiday. In this essay, I will discuss two opposite attitudes of modern people to some traditional celebrations and give example and some advice to the issue.\nOn the one hand, it seems that the majority of people does not care about the reason of holidays, they are ready to enjoy them without any concrete reasons. First of all, that happens usually because of the fact that many people overwork and do not live in their work-life balance, so they are very glad to have additional day-off. The second explanation to the issue can be that people follow some traditions from ancient times, so some of those traditions became as a routines, that the basic meaning could be forgotten during the times. But nations continue folloving some customs just because they got used to them, even if they do not remember the main purpose of the celebration. The third reason to that can be that young generation do not understand some of their ancestors traditions, so they just accept some festivals from their predecessors as days when they are able to make their lives brighter and enjoy themselves.\nOn the other hand, there are exist people who know the basics of festivals and familiar with the hystory of traditions in their countries. Such kind of people usually consern about their traditions and pay more attantions to some specific atributes of festivals, which can be symbolise health, wealth, success, or maybe femily hapiness, et cetera. In my opinion, it would be beneficial if the main purposes of some, especially ancient, traditions, to be explained to others. First of all, people would become familiar with some old customs and maybe partly could understand the reasons why their ancestors used some kind of colors and accesuars during that holidays. Additionally, people would know better the histories of their countries and share those knowledge with younger generations. So, the youth could not only enjoy themselves during celebrations, but also become more intelligent about traditions in their homelands.\nTo sum it up, it is widely spread attitude on holiday organisation as to only having entertainment, dancing, and having wonderful moods during those days. However, if the history of festivals and ancient traditions is spread properly, people become more wisdom about the main reasons of those celebrations in their countries.",

    "essay": "As the years go by, it can be clearly seen that our minds are starting to abandon the true meaning of a nation's religious and traditional festivals by replacing with something that is not even related to the legend behind the festival.\nA great example of this is in India during the nations' biggest festival, Diwali. Diwali is celebrated across the nation in the month of October for it was when Lord Rama, the greatest hero of our holy Hindu scriptures returned victorious from his battle in Lanka by defeating the demon king, Ravana. Traditionally, there used to be mass 'pujas' (worship ceremonies) held in every nook and corner of the nation, you could literally find and join a puja ceremony anywhere you went in India.\nAlthough they are still held, the new generation of Indian youth proudly known as 'Gen-z', is starting to abandon the true meaning of this festival by mending it in their own way. Instead of spending money to call over the poor and homeless to their homes to give them a meal (like what was traditionally done), they are using all that money on partying and gambling in the 'name of Lord Ram and religion'. I personally find this utterly disgusting and disrespectful. Although it is a much more eco-friendly method of celebrating than bursting crackers, I feel that it is like you are spitting in the face of Lord Rama.\nThe case of India and Diwali is just one of the many ways people are abandoning festive traditions to just enjoy themselves and not give back to the society (like the purpose is in at least all Hindu festivals).\nAt the end of the day, it depends of which country and it's festival. If you look like a nation like China, their grandest festival, the Chinese New Year as depicted in the picture given below, has still not lost it's authenticity. They still hae the same traditons intact as they were when it was first ever celebrated thousands of years ago.\nBut as a whole, traditional and religious festivals are losing their true meaning becasue of the intention of the youth to just enjoy themselves.",

    "essay": "In recent years, it is argued that many people have lost track of the meaning behind traditional and religious celebrations; Now, people seem to treat these celebrations as another holiday break. The following essay will fully endorse the statement and examine the reasons behind it.\nFirstly, there are several reasons why people forgot about the message behind celebrations. One of the most significant one is globalisation. As people start connecting with each other through social media worldwide, many people are too distracted with the latest trends and updates. A study from Yales University mentioned that 60% of the population on earth do not persuit the stories about their traditional roots and background. Hence, they do not celebrate festive or cultural events meaningfully. Another important reason is broken families. People who experienced a tough childhood without a male or female parent are not capable of understanding their own traditions and values. Therefore, they do not grasp the concept of cultural celebrations.\nMoreover, there are also cons to this arguments as people just want to take a holiday break. Although people may argue that it is important to remember the intention behind diverse celebrations, others just want to use the day for self-fulfillment purposes. For example, people would organise a party and invite friends over to their house so they can have a good time. Another argument that people only want enjoyment during festive periods is work-stress related illnesses. The majority of middle class workers are hardworking and dedicated to their job. However, the period of time for holiday breaks are significantly short and they just want to use the celebration events to rest at home. Despite the fact that they are neglecting their duties to demonstrate the meaning behind these celebrations to the younger generations, they also have a right to take care of themselves mentally and physically before others.\nIn conclusion, there are both sides of the argument on why people think others have forgotten the meaning behind event celebrations and why this is not neccesarily true all the time. Personally, I agree that people should always find the meaning behind these celebrations in order to understand themselves better.",

    "essay": "Jobs such as actors, musicians or athlete earns a lot of money, however, a part of people argued that these kinds of people are overpaid. In my opinion, I disagree with this view and believes that they deserved the high salary.\nPeople who works as a movie stars, musicians and sports player deserved high money paid. This is because they advocated all there time and effort to get the salary that they have today. Before they become famous, they only have few incomes or even get nothing. That is to say, many musicians did not get any payment at the begining of their career, so do the actors and sports players, they spent their time but do not get any money. For instance, before being a well-known musicians, they have to spend their own money on buying equipment to produce musics or to public the songs they have made. Also, the creativety and their works cannot be measured by money. Thus, they deserved high salary because of their profession and uncopyable works.\nJobs which needs professional skills and the job envolves high risk shoul also be highly paid. Such as doctors and programmers, their job are unplaceable because these envolved professional knowledge that not everyone had. Moreover, people works in high-risk environment deserved high payment too. For example, fire-fighters, they might got hurt or even die while working. Therefore, higher salary is needed for jobs that need special skills and career with high risk.\nTo sum up, I agree with the statement because of the reasons above, and jobs with special knowledge and people works in dangerous environment should also be highly paid.",

    "essay": "Should cultural places be charged? This question opens a big debate. On the one hand, there are some museums that require an admission fee to be paid. On the other hand, there are free-entry museums. I believe that if the charge to be paid is not expensive then it is right and fair to require an admission payment to visit a culutural place.\nIn general, we used to believe that free is always better. However, I believe it is not a waste of money if they are spent to increase your knowledge. In Italy, for instance, museums and cultural places, in general, do not receive the economical support they need from the administrative centres. This phenomenon implies the following choice: either museums have to ask people to pay an entry fee or they have to stop taking care of the building and the artistic works they host. Then, I believe that to pay an admission fee is a way people, who are interested in art and in culture in general, can demonstrate their taking care of the place in which art is preserved.\nWhat should be the negative consequence of asking for an entry fee? In general, we believe that the money we spend is wasted. Although we spend them to obtain something we appreciate a lot, we always have the tendency to think that money should not be used and preserved. I cannot disagree with this way of thinking. However, I believe that spending money to pay a trisfling amount of money to get access to a cultural place is not a waste. Rather, it is a sort of investment for your personal culture and for the cultural building itself. What's more, generally, if people have to spend money to do any activity they used to enjoy as they can. As good materialists, we want to live the experience to respect the money spent. Then, paying an entry fee will encourage people who care about art to visit a museum rather than those who do not care. Art maybe is made less accessible but, in my opinion, will be more respected. The entry fee should not be (and in general is not) expensive. I cannot see why it should be seen as a loss of money to pay the entry fee of 5 euros to go inside the Louvre in Paris, the estraordinary Valle dei Templi in Sicily, or the magnificent Uffizi gallery in Florence. I believe that money could not be spent in a better way than to visit these places.\nIn conclusion, I believe there are no real disadvantages caused by the payment of an entry fee, rather there are economic advantages that could help the administration of the museums in maintaining the quality of the service and preserving art works.",

    "essay": "Many artistic places prefer to have an entry fee, whereas others let free access. I fully think that the benefits to have admission fees compensate the drawbacks to be not free.\nMany individuals would visit museum or art galleries if it were free which could attract more tourists. Unfortunately, admission charge decreases the possibility to discover paintings or masterpieces. However, before being a cultural place, art galleries are a place where numerous employees work. Indeed, if visitors had not to purchase the entrance, workforce would be not paid and the place would be not clean as museum should be. Moreover, huge museums as the British Museum have some sponsors to restore masterpieces whereas small museums have sometimes not the fundings and hence, admission fees would help it. Then, having an entry fee limit the number of individuals who do not really want to see art and appreciate the place.\nConcerning to cultural places, museum and art galleries know that many households could not afford ticket entrances for their offspring so many museums establish reduced price for teenagers and children. This project improves the relation between young people and the culture, then it allows children to be attracted to culture, partipate to the technical expenses behind the entry fee and after to visit again some cultural places when they will grow up and purchase the full price. Moreover, purchasing tickets help to the economy of the country which sometimes famous cultural places are a significant part of country's income. For instance, admission fees in museum are two third of the tourism's outcome in France.\nTo conclude, I believe that admission fees should outweigh free entrance because it does not let the worth process of museum to work. Even if sometimes admission fees are costly for us, there is always a meaning behind the prices.",

    "essay": "Most world-class museums are free in London, but some museums and art galleries around the world have an admission charges. Frankly speaking, museums with free entry do not mean no cost incurred in their operation. In contrary, there is a lot of maintenance expenditure on exhibits of museums, particularly on historical paintings and valuable statues. These costs are funded by the governments in order to provide the welfare to their civilians. Some people advocate all museums and art galleries should charge the entrance fees as the public funding have to be spent in dire need of foods and housing in the community. This essay attempts to find out its benefits against costs.\nThere is no doubt that thousand millions expenditure in the operating of museums are financed by the local governments. The UK government reportedly spends almost 500 million pounds a year on supporting the cultural and artistic life of the country. Some people object to this expenditure, arguing that it is unfair to devote much tax payers' money to things which only appeal to a minority of people. They think these attractions should be self-funding, in other words, museums and galleries should set an entrance fee which cover their costs, besides, these costs are reflected via a realistic amount for tickets. The public funds saved could then be spent on more important matters such as housing or providing better educational facilities.\nNevertheless, the culture and arts are not a trivial matter but a vital part of a nation's identity. Not only the arts have a key educational role by representing the traditions and heritage of people, but also galleries and museums should be freely available to all, rich or poor. It is clear that this is basic welfare to all citizens in a country. From economic aspects, tourism can be drived by these attractions. A case in point is British museum, which appeals an endless influx of tourists from various parts of the world to visit every year. Therefore, they are responsible for a significant amount of employment.\nMy take on this is that the governments have a responsibility to support a range of cultural and artistic activities and to make the museums and galleries free available to all their civilians despite many demanding on their funding resources in the community.",

    "essay": "Museums and art galleries are exhibitions for interested and fully passionate people. However, some places are charging the admission fee for entry, while others are free.\nI strongly agree that the advantages of this charge outweigh the disadvantages. In this essay, I will demonstrate by using examples of the funding management of Museum Siam and the charging rate of museums and art galleries in Thailand.\nOn the one hand, there is ample evidence that the admission charge for entry exhibitions is used for fixing and improving facilities. For example, Museum Siam in Thailand exhibiting in the old buildings in Bangkok city manages the admission fees for fixing the building and for caring toilet and parking facilities. However, this fee is just a small part of managing funds as the museum is supported by the Thai government, which responses to minister expenses.\nOn the other hand, some museums and art galleries in Thailand are free for Thais only, while the foreigners have to pay for entry. Since the exhibitions are fully taken care from governments for facilitating the visitors, this brings to a benefit for Thai citizens to explore the exhibitions without any loss of their money. Also, the exhibition aims to promote for foreigners rather than domestic people, leading to the charge rising to double of the normal price when high season.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the admission fees are significant for supporting the museum administrations in order to take care of and fix the facilities. Also, it seems like exchanging systems, if you want to gain extraordinary experiences and fulfill your passions, you have to pay for it.",

    "essay": "Something that has been debated about a lot recently, people around the world have different views about to whom the design of newly constructed buildings should be controlled by. Today, I am here to discuss both sides of the matter and at the end will give my own view.\nThe people who believe the design of these buildings should be controlled by governments believe so, because they feel that the governments will design the buildings in a way that is not too flashy and nor to minimalistic. It has been seen may times that buildings built by constructing companies/ the financers turn out to be either very flashy or minimalistic. A great example of this is in India's capital, Delhi, where an originally planned office, had exteriors constructed in a very childish and jazzy manner. A thing to also keep in mind that this was the construction of a private office for the top lawyer in Delhi, Arun Deshmukh. He handed over the design of his office to the constructors feeling they won't do anything immature. 4 years later, however, when he went to see the final result of his much-awaited private office, he was completey bewildered by the sight. Instead of seeing a normal office-like building with normal cement on it's exterior, he saw that his dream office looked the exterior of a night club! Instead of normal cement, the exterior was built with transparent glass, and Mr. Deshmukh's name and designation, written in a florescent like way, was carved out on a 3 metre long glass slab!!\nComing to the people who believe the control of the design should go to the constructors/people who finance the building think so because they feel that not everything should be in the hands of the government. They also feel that since it was their initiative to get that building built, they should have the final say on how it should look like.\nWhen it comes to my opinion, i believe that the control of the design of the building should go to the person/people who first thought of getting it constructed, meaning the people hired architects and did the needful to get an ideal design of the building they want to construct.",

    "essay": "It is often argued that governments should involve in construction's design in huge cities, while others argued that governments do not have to retrict the free of designers' imagination if those designs are splendid fit on the cities. I believe that if that were to happen, it would be the positive development. This essay will highlight the both views and give personal opinion from the former argument's side.\nTo begin with latter opinion, although governments have worried about the combination of buildings entirely, the strong limitation about design can cause squandering of designers' skills. There are huge number of competitions about designing building in this society, and the evolution in these fields has developed dramatically. However, if there is a strict criteria on design of building, the majority of intelligences do not need to hammer away to come up with revolutional outline for building.\nOn the other hand, signitured design of the big cities by itself can be the purpose of trevelling as a landmark, and it can be followed by significant economical achievement in the country. To take myself as an example, in 2017, I went to Gold Coast for study automotive engineering, and I was stunnied becaused of the atmosphere which is formed by combination of similar buildings and beach. Furthermore, according to the research from Sydney university, Gold Coast is one of the cities which make a fortune because of marvelous view.\nTo sum up with, I would therefore argue that in spite of the fact that building design restriction can influence on architects negatively, it has a potential ability to make a significant profit in the future.",

    "essay": "Many people believe that the government should restrict the new buildings construction plan in the metropolis; however, some people think that those who invest in building construction should have the liberty to design it. In my opinion, the government should allow the construction industry without so much scrutiny.\nNowadays, many modern architectural buildings have been constructed in big cities such as IT companies, apartments, shopping malls, and many more, making our city very attractive. The private construction industry can only invest a massive amount in the structure, and it will not only look good but also boost our country's economy. To exemplify, Dubai is famous for its different architectural buildings, such as Burj Khalifa, the tallest building globally, the Dubai frame, and many more.\nAlthough it looks nice and pleasant for us to see the city with new buildings, the construction industry should abide by the law while constructing. It should not cause any damage to the people around the building; however, the skyscrapers are a great hindrance for flights. For example, a major human-made disaster happened a decade ago. The pilot who flew passenger's flight could not fly properly, as there were many skyscrapers near the airport, which led to an air crash, and many people died in the accident. It is one of the reasons some people think that government should control the building structures.\nIn conclusion, the government's intervention in the construction industry is not required until they follow all the new building structure rules. Furthermore, if we construct more recent buildings, it would increase our country's economy.",

    "essay": "As population grows and society expands, noise pollution inevitably occurs more often and worse. This concept triggered some people to start thinking that there oughts to be strict regulations on how much noise each individual can make in order to minimise the harmful effect on other people. In this essay, I will discuss both advantages and disadvantages of the regulations and suggest whether it is beneficial or not after all.\nOne of the advantages if strict laws are applied is that it is the easiest and most effective way of solving the problem in a short term. The noise level of human population will significantly drop as being loud becomes an illegal action to carry out. For instacne, even imposing a fine due to excessive sound one made can strongly discourage him or her from making loud noises ever again. Furthermore, people's standard of living will most likely to be enhanced as there are less disturbance caused by noise. People will be able to enjoy quiet, relaxing weekends even in central cities, for example.\nIn contrast to the preceding positive outcomes, there are disadvantages due to the strict laws such as too much restrictions on people. The laws can be considered as rather aggressive and coercive since people's some daily life routines may get spoiled. Some hobbies like singing and even special cases like emergency situations will confront some problems if such laws become real. Moreover, it is almost impractical to set up the standard of 'loud' noise or even measuring the decibels individulas make all the time. Society would get rather intensive and monotonous once the laws controlling the sound level are implemented.\nIn summary, despite the efficient aspects of the laws, it is more important to acknowledge the negative sides such as stress individuals suffer from strict regulations or damages on their lifestyle. Noise pollution should be resolved through more friendly means like advertisement rather than inflexible laws.",

    "essay": "With the increasing population in cities,noise pollution has been one of the important causes of concern.This essay presents the advantages and disadvantages of the strict laws that are made to control noise pollution.\nNoise pollution affects different groups of people in various ways.The increasing noise in recent days has led to increasing problems of hearing impairment in people in today's society.Also,the noise pollution has a devastating affects on the heart patients and it has been affecting people who are working and studying in various ways.By implementing strict rules like imposing heavy fines on vehicles honking unnecessarily and filing a case on the noise caused by the public gatherings like rallies,the above problems can be addressed.For example, recent studies have shown that the cities having less noise pollution have been leading better life when compared to those with noise pollution.\nHowever,implementing strict laws on noise caused by a person also has some disadvantages.Firstly,different religions have different kinds of festivals which cause a lot of noise.For instance,diwali,one of the most celebrated festivals in India,is celebrated by firing crackers causing a lot of noise is affected by implementing these laws.Secondly,most of the people with religious beliefs will have a bad impact by these rules.To give an example,the prayers in masjids are made with loud noise so that it can reach a large group of people living in the area.\nTo conclude,implemeting strict rules like fines and filing a case on the people causing noise pollution have a good impact on the health of the society and increasing the efficiency of work where as the festivals and the religious centres have a negative impact by these laws.",

    "essay": "Noise pollution has caught the attention of the public due to the disturbance it gives to the community. This issue has raised some concern whether proper legislations must be implemented or not. In this essay, the positive side as well as the drawbacks of noise will be discussed and the reason why I think that it is better for our leaders to take action regarding this matter will be explained.\nNoise can give the community awareness and enjoyment. Noise can help people know what is going on in their area. For example, during thee COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, it is mandatory for the local government to sound sirens and alarms for the city to know that the curfew has began, leading to people's awareness that they should be at their homes in time. In terms of enjoyment, a substantial amount of noise can make one enjoy his free time, such that his leisure activity is related to music. Instrumentalists need time to practice their skills for them to excel in this field. If laws regarding to noise will be implemented, their practice will be controlled in such a way that this will not be available on their ends.\nOn the other hand, one considers noise as a pollution that can cause detrimental effects in the society, resulting for an aim to reduce it by the help of the government. Noise can give a person distractions not only in his rest, but also in his work. Work form home is becoming ubiquitous nowadays. Once noise is uncontrolled, there is a tendency that distractions occur, which cause poor career performance. Also, sufficient rest is an essential commodity for the body and brain to recharge after long shifts of work. Noise can hinder one to attain this, leading to health problems, such as brain and physical fatigue. Hence, laws must be implemented by the authority to prevent the drawbacks that it can bring to an individual.\nIn conclusion, noise is beneficial to some for it brings an increase in awareness and enjoyment in leisure activities, however, one ought to consider the health risks it inflicts and its negative effects to one's work performance. In my view, the government must strictly prohibit noise pollution and that legislations must be firmly established to prevent the drawbacks it can make.",

    "essay": "Recently, there have been several laws to control the noise made by neighbors and surrounded places close to people's accommodations. Some people think that these laws should be strict and effectively enforced by authorities in order to avoid any small noise that might disturb the private comfortability. Others believe that such laws might entail a few disadvantages and negative repercussions on people's lives. In this essay I will be trying to count possible advantages and disadvantages of this legislation.\nIt is well known that home is the ideal place to rest, relax and bring positive energies to the residents. Thus, noise made by the neighbors might threat these unique blessings we are used to enjoying in our houses. Moreover, many people perform vital actions within their homes that require silence and high concentration, such as studying, reading and other forms of creative activities. Therefore, governments' duty is to guarantee that these activities are performed without any disturbance, by making specific laws to control the amount of noise and ensure optimal quality of life for all the citizens. In addition, if there were not laws to control the noise, we would encounter many more fights and inconvenient incidents among neighbors.\nOn the other hand, there is another aspect to be considered. Calling for strict laws and total preventing of any sounds produced by adjacent people could sounds unacceptable. People still have the basic right to arrange meetings and parties at their homes, and others need to listen to music as a vital action for their soul and wellbeing.\nTo conclude, in order to find the balance between the advantages and the disadvantages, governments might design flexible laws to meet the people's needs. For example, in some cities, noise preventing is valid only in specific periods of the day, periods in which most of the people supposed to rest and need silence.",

    "essay": "There are people who believe that the mixture of nationalities make faster the development of a country. Although, it could seem that an international environment could influence negatively the culture of a country, I believe that the exchange that is born from people coming from different places is essential in order to develop the social attitudes of the citiziens and to have new ideas and perspectives.\nThe internationality of a country permits people to develop their social attitudes. To live in the same country with people who have originated in a different one require all of them to be open to discover now personal outlooks. They have to communicate between each other and also to respect the different cultural habits they have. This lead people to be more open-minded and ready to accept new changes. A country in which there are these features will develop from different point of view faster. Indeed, people will be already able to understand the flow of the new trends and they will be open to new economical and political choices. By contrast, in a country in which there is no way to interact with people who have a different nationality will be more difficult to understand the limit and the possibilities of their country. Although the tradition of the country will be preserved, people will be less accostumated to the change trying to mantain their traditional custums, even if uncorrect, as soon as they can. The political and economical assestment of these country will reflect the closeness of the population. For instance, they will be less concerned about the stability of the other countries and they will try to develop their own without caring of the international consequences.\nFurthermore, a country in which there are different people who comes from different places is one in which new ideas and perspectives can be develped. Indeed, workplaces will be encouraged in their development by the interaction between people who have different culture. In the general picture, the benefit of each single and small company will impact positively on the country itself and its economical status. To go further, people who have to interact with other foreign nationalities will be able to communicate with them and this means that they will be able to speak and understand other languages other than their mother tongue. The ability to be fluently in other languages, mostly in English, nowadays is essential for the develop of a country. The companies will be able to expand their trade.\nIn conclusion, I completely agree with the idea that a country can develop faster its population is made of different nationalities. There will be advantages from the social and cultural perspective as well as from the economical and political point of view.",

    "essay": "It is belived that countries are developing faster and become more inspiring when their populations consist of variety of people with different nationalities. In my opinion, it is very controversial question, but I believe that nations who are tolerant to others and friendly are able to succeed in constracting better world not only for themselves and their surroundings but also for future generations. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view about attractiveness and development of countries based on national diversity.\nOn the one hand, people of different nationalities are hardly able to understand each other and can be impatient for people who have another nationalities, that can create difficulties in communication, making agreements, sovling of problems. For example, people with different backgrounds can strat arguing about better governmental constitutions and politics, religions, educational system, traditional and another types of medicine, and so on. It worths to mention that none of those people will be completely right, if they deside to show off their experience instead of accepting ideas of others and just giving advice. Moreover, some disputes can even lead to quarrels, but not to finding the better dessisions, that can influence on safety of people with different nationalities. So, for living peacefully and sharing some ideas of better developmental practice, people should first of all respect each other independantly of their nantionalities.\nOn the other hand, people of various nationalities are able to create not only interesting and diverse community, but also share knowlege and experience in order to achieve the best results in countries' development. For achieving this, people should follow several basic rules, which are usually unwritten, but those mental and behavioral lows should be understood by everyone. Firstly, they should be tolerant to each other and accepting some differences. Secondly, they should be polite when they want to share their knowlege and experiences, not showing off. Thirdly, it would be wonderful if they are able to create international community where people can communicate and make friends. Last but not least, they should remember that their attitudes for each other influence on the world as a whole where they and their children live, so they should be responsible for their words and behavior.\nIn conclusion, countries which managed to connect people of different nationalities and create a friendly surroundings, in my opinion, are able to develope faster and look like fascinating diverse community which consist of people of various backgrounds.",

    "essay": "A nation becomes more interesting and advance faster when the population contains a blended numbers of nationalities. This essay completely agrees with this statement, because this will lead every ethnic group to reflect their lifestyles , and also boost the tourism industry.\nOn the one hand, When every ethnic group reflects the society they belong to it. This will helps in creating postive representation of the society as they will learn about each others through several ways , like food, clothes and traditions. For example, a survey conducted by the minstry of tourism in Egypt showed around 90 percent of people agreed that this will helps to fill the gap of cultural differences, as it will facilitates communication across nations and enhance confidence and trust between both cultures.\nOn the other hand, tourism industry will benefit when the population is blended. This is because, alot of tourists will be attracted to that foreign destination. So, this will boost the economy of the nation as growing numbers of jobs will be available.As as result, unemployment rate will decrease. For Instance, Australia benefited from the tourism industry especially in areas like Queensland and Sydney, where a large number of vacant jobs is available which resulted in growing economy.\nIn conclusion , a society contains a mixture of nationalities will helps it to grow culturally and economically. As every ethinic group will learn about each others, it will also benefit the economy, as a result more jobs will be available and unemployment rate will decrease.",

    "essay": "Some people believe that having a population with a mixture of nationalities makes countries more interesting and helps them to develop faster. In my opinion, people from different nationalities have their own points of view, therefore each of them provide different perspectives to make a country more developed.\nPeople who lives in a country with one nationality generally do not want other people from different countries to migrate their countries. The reason for this kind of thought is about safety of their countries. Moreover, they do not want to employ people who migrated. Therefore, these countries become more and more isolated from other ones. In this globalization area, a country which has just a one way of thinking, do not have oppurtinity to develop and becoma a interest to different nationalities.\nOn the other hand countries with multinational populations have mixture of cultures. Each of the people provides a different tradition of their own nationality. These traditions may become a way of entertainment to attract tourists. Due to the tourism being a source of income, it is one of the development sources of a country.\nIn addition, nowadays, there are lots of countries who lets knowledagble employees from other nationalities to work in their countries. These high skilled workers can be positioned in the places in need. Their ideas can be valued. If a country support them, they can be the new face of the development.\nIn conclusion, a country always needs development. Development can be achieved through innovation and lots of ideas. I believe that having a mixed population with different nationalites is a one way to do it.",

    "essay": "There are some beliefs that when there is a mixture of nationalities, a country can improve it's development. In my opinion, I believe these statement can be both true and false at the same time.\nMixture of nationalities may promote country's development as some particular nationalities are more proficient in one particular activity than another nationalities. For example, Jamaican has a superior body in running. They are the whipping out all the gold medals in running. Each nationalities has it's own strongness, so they can help each other to develop the country.\nOn the other hand, development in the country may not be fast when different nationalities are in one country due to the conflicts between the locals and the foreigners about culture and language differences. Such conflicts may rise and result in slower development as there are going to be communication difficulties between the local citizens and foreigners. In addition, local citizens may be annoyed of foreign people taking away their jobs, creating more anger between each other. To exemplify, USA is one of the country that has multinational population. USA has developed a lot over a past decade and is a leader of technology but at the same time, it contains many social issues such as race hatred. USA is expected to develop less compared to other countries for many reasons, but mainly due to intelligent and competitive foreign experts leaving their country.\nIn conclusion, I believe different nationalities will play a critical role in the country's development. However, the government should educate their local people to understand and respect other country's cultures in order to maximise the productivity in their country.",

However, it's sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or artist.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
    "essay": "Most people have oponions that the most essential thing for achieving success in any field such as art and sport is natural talent. Other people disagree with this statement and believe that everybody in their early ages can become a professional sportsmen or artist if they are exellently taught. From my point of view, this is an extrimely controversial topic. I honestly believe that children who are interested in the subject they learn and who have natural abilities for some fields can become more successful than those who just encouraged by adults. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view and then give my review to the issue.\nOn the one hand, children who have talents from their births can become advanced in the chosen area because they have natural willingness and abilities to succeed in this field. Those youngsters can spend hours without any interraption in the process of making and creating something. By doing this, they improve their abilities and boost their skills, which become more adcanced in each step. Additionally, they are very involve in their studies without stimulation from others that their achievements are inevitable. For example, my son who is three years old enjoy painting and I always notice some improvements in his paintings, that means that he improve his skills in daily basis.\nOn the other hand, children who do not have talents or nutural abilities for great achievements in any field can be encouraged by adult professionals, who can educate as well as motivate them. For example, when I was a child, I was impressed by music teacher who played the piano in the kindergaten which I visited. After her wonderful performance, I asked my mother to register my for my education in the music school, which was close to our home. So, I was quite motivated to fullfill my dream in getting musical background, that is why I studed hard every day during seven years. I am not only become a musician and got my certificate with exellent marks, but I also won some musical competitions. So, willingness to become successful in chosen field is essential issue.\nIn conclusion, children who have talents and natural abilities for achievements in any field are easely can become successful because they do not need additional motivation from adults, whereas children who found the sphere which they interested in even without talent can improve their skill by allocating more hours and investing more energy for implementing their dream.",

    "essay": "It is common to think that in fields like art or sport success is linked to natural talent, even though it is stated that children can obtain good results also trough learning and pratice.\n-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------\nIn my opinion, I believe that only a combination of natural talent and sacrifice can lead you to obtain success; for this reason, you can learn and improve several skills, but you will not win against a person with this type of gift, unless this person does not pratice enough.\n-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------\nTo provide an example, if we think about Raffaello, one of the most remarkable painters of all times, and his life we may be disappointed; in fact, thanks to his natural talent he started to paint since he was 8.\nHowever, we have to bear in mind that he constantly made a research in order to discover new techniques and to gain new inspirations.\nIf he was not so focused on his art's improvement, he would not be able to paint an entire church.\n-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------\nIf we move to another field as sport is always more evident the existence of a pattern. Indeed, it is crystal clear that professional players need to pratice everyday, regardless their talent.\nHowever, Ronaldo this year has winned the nominee for the best football player in the world not only for his innate talent but also for the effort put during training in order to reach always an higher goal.\n-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------\nIn conclusion, through commitment you will obtain good results, but to achieve the highest level you must be gifted with a natural talent.",

    "essay": "Achieving success in any field requires dedication and perservance. Some people believe that only those who are naturally gifted can perfrom greatly in fields such as art and sport while others do not. This essay will discuss both views and illustrate why anyone through constant practise and hardwork can have a bright future in both of these fields, whether it was sports or art.\nHaving natural talent in art or sports is surely an advantage that could lead to accomplishments in the future. It puts the person levels above those who are not as fortunate as him or her. For instance, Lionel Messi, arguably the best player to ever kick a ball, is considered by many football fans the most talented play in history. According to Messi's coach, he is not the most dedicated player out of his teammates since he does not put in the same amount of effort as many others, but he certaintly yields the best results. Personally, whenever I see him play, I feel that there is a unvisible force of attraction, similar to a magnet, between his foot and the ball. There are many examples where people invested many hours of their day into learning art, but could not produce something of high quality. My sister, who is 26 years old, is actually one of those examples. She spent 2 hours a day for four years practising art, but she could not draw better than my cousin, who is 12 years and rarely does any drawing.\nOn the other hand, if someone is willing to put in the work and ready to face whatever it takes to reach the top, he or she will definitely do so, even if no natural is found. After all, certain skills are needed in any field, including sport and art, and by frequent training, those skills could easily be aquirred. One of my close friends was overweight and could not score a single goal in a 90-minute handball match. However, after multiple hours put into improving his technique and abilities, he became the best player in school; he was chosen by the coach as a captain to lead our team in a tournament.\nTo conclude, although having talent eases the path to success, it is not a requirment for others to do the same thing, if they put in enough effort and have commitment.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, due to the development in science and technology, expolring the remote natural places has become available. Exploring is what scientists and tourists are always like and eager to do because, invariably, unknown keeps an attraction of mystery. However, there are pros and cons in travelling to remote natural environment.\nAs far as we know, the improvement in science and progress in technology always comes from exploring the unknown destinations. Travelling to a remote natural environment, take the South Pole for example, can conduct many research which cannot be done in common places. These kinds of research is helpful in Biology and in finding the origin of human being. The second biggest advantage is that it can improve the tourism in its local area, and tourism means a better condition for local people. In the past, in some remote places of China without torism, the native people there had a poor sanitory condition and after the arrivals of travellers, people there can earn a living and improve their living conditions.\nHowever, everything in the world has its donwside. The activities in scientific research and commerce will cause contalmination to the environment in remote places. For instance, the constructions of the scientific stations have occupied the places where many wild animals there used to call home. There is no doubt that such activities will lead to a decrease in the number of these animals which will also influent the local ecosystem.\nTo sum up, the travel to remote natural environment will not only help to improve the development of science but also help with the local tourism, but the disadvantage is that these activities will cause damages to the local environment.",

However, discovering those faraway environments could increase environment-related issues such as climatic change.\nSouth Pole is a place which has ever seen human activities before, and it seems to have numerous discoveries to make. Indeed, scientists which fauna and flora are the current studies, could find new mode of the marine life and discover new species. Moreover, people who are interested in travelling to South Pole might now do it, children who dreamed about polar animals could see them. Thus, the tourism should create new jobs and develop economic growth.\nNevertheless, as each breakthrough that the society does, there are repercussions. In this case, the harmful effect of this discovery is global warming because when humans go somewhere, they let a carbon footprint which directly changes the environment. For instance, if individuals had to travel to South Pole, they would only use air or marine transport such as cruise ship which pollute the area with greenhouse gases. As a result, those greenhouse gases can warm nature which, unfortunately, would melt the ice and have a detrimental impact on the landscapes. As a consequence, in the forthcoming decades, this panorama may disappear. Thereby, if scientists want to study this natural area, they could not or in a limited way.\nTo conclude, the advantages could be to discover new landscapes and how species can live in this hostile area.

It' is often argued that there are some benefits and drawbacks of this type of journey. I believe there are some drawbacks of this pursuit, but I see more benefits as it might allow researchers and especially travellers to explore natural ecosystem safely without destroying it.\nFirst of all remote travelling will give broad opportunities scientists to research more untouchable natural ecosystems. Those researches' results might play a crucial role to understand our nature well and therefore to take firm steps to protect it. For example, the growing researches showed, that after thourough exploration of the North and South Capes, scientists could finally understand the devastating effect of the Global warming, as researches revealed dramatically melting process of the glaciers. Though remote research might be base for some scientific breakthrough, however in some cases, it's important to be in a place personally to measure changes not only visually but also to take some lab examples.\nOn the other side, Web net based journey might be good alternative for those tourists who want to explore world but can't spend more money or resources on that journey. In this case remote journey is beneficial for both sides: for the natural environment which is staying safe from tourists' crowds interference, and for the tourists as well, as they shouldn't spend more resources on this kind of traveling. For instance, if person showing willingness to see the natural environment such as rainforest but can't travel, this type of the tourism might be the great chance. Though new technologies allow to see and even listen the natural environment voices whole, however real feelings and emotions of being for instance in the Southern Pole impossible to recieve when you are online.\nIn conclusion, there are some benefits and disadvantages of the remote traveling and research work that should be taken into consideration.

    "essay": "There is an increasing number of improper drug users in the modern society, especially the adolescents and teenagers experimenting with various drugs, regardless of the legality of such drugs. This phenomenon spurs the discussion about the underlying reasons, such as the detrimental influence of parents and other people acting improperly. This essay will explore the causes and impacts of extensive drug use among young people, and introduce plausible suggestions to address this issue.\nThe dominant cause of this problem is the publicity of pharmaceutical companies that exaggerating the efficacy of their products while playing down or concealing the side effects of such drugs, notably, the drugs that can alleviate the tiredness and improve the mood while risking addiction or even the loss of rationality. These drugs help teenagers a lot in terms of avoiding the sleepiness, especially in classes and lectures where they have to focus on the knowledge points expressed by teachers and lecturers. However, given the lack of information about the adverse effects involved, teenagers may gradually get addicted to such drugs. The other contributing factor is the absence of attention paid by parents who more often than not, have to deal with the tremendous workload so that they have little time spent with their children. The improper drug use exerts far-reaching impacts on teenagers and adolescents. The most notable effect in this regard is the deterioration of health conditions, both physically and mentally, as exemplified by the higher frequency of asthma and the worsening ability of socialising.\nTo tackle this problem, it is necessary for pharmacential corporations to clarify the pros and cons of their products, and for parents to spend more time with their children to identify potential hazards. I expect in the future, more suggestions could arise to solve the problem of drug abuse among young people.",

In this essay, i am going to discuss the causes and some consequences of the widespread abuse of drugs by young adults, and give some recommendations that will help combat this trend.\nTo begin, it is a well known fact that the abuse of drugs can cause some devastating effects to the consumer. A lot of youths today, learnt this lifestyle from their parents, or thier immediate environment. For example, a teenager whose parents take cocaine, will inevitably take after the parents, afterall, an apple does not fall far away from its tree.\nAlso, a teenager that smokes illegal drugs like marijuana, might not even live to tell the rest of the stories. The chemical components of this drug are incredibly strong, that when abused, can lead to psychological symptoms, like, hallucinations, delusions, and even in worst cases death. A recent study, showed that 75% of young adults, who suffer from hallucinations and delusions, are as a result of intake of hard drugs.\nIn terms of recommendations, the governments should set up addiction clinic to help combat the ubiquitous trend among youths. This will go a long way in alleviating the addiction towards drugs. There should also be an awareness created to help instill fear into obstinate teenagers. Psychotherapy should also be recommended.\nTo conclude, a lot of youngsters are abusing drugs, due to the fact that their parents partake in this ugly trends, however, the government should creat an awareness on the repercussions associated with drug abuse, and also build addiction clinics to help them nip this addiction to the bud.",

    "essay": "The use of drugs has been a warning habit in modern day society. In some research, it shows that households are losing their financing easily due to the fact that one of the parents has been addicted to drugs. Although there are some drugs which were approved by the government to be used moderately, yet some people are using these drugs heavily.\nThis has drawn the attention of the youth either by a drug addict parent or a friend. Moreover, the number of youngsters taking drugs has increased dramatically throughout the years as there are people who provide these drugs in the black market. This critical issue has caused serious issues both socially and mentally.\nThe social and mental impact of using drugs by the youngsters have damaged the educational progress, the social participation such as family and friends gatherings. Additionally, lack of stamina, weight loss, and loss of appetite are key factors of excessive use of drugs.\nThere is a number of contributing elements to the phenomena. One of these elements is the sense of belonging to a group. Since humans are social animals, young people want to have the feeling of being accepted and loved, and this can be sensible when it comes to a group of friends. Therefore, once someone introduces a drug, the rest of the group will try, and if one says no, then they will be rejected. However, this rejection can be helping to solve this alarming issue.\nThe solution is to find a way to distinguish the types of drugs and legalize the ones that do not harm greatly and prepare in parallel the better ways to control the consumption of drugs.",

    "essay": "In recent years, improvement and immense expansion of supermarkets, including convenience stores often takes place of the local business. Some people are concerned that their own local businesses will be taken by large companies. Although it is understandable to feel scared, and anxious, I disagree with this idea. People always need to adjust the issue flexibly. I would like to share examples and ideas in Japanese society.\nTo begin with, the majority of society is based on capitalist society. This means that people who run their own businesses are always competitive with competitors. This means that large companies are more beneficial to provide more convenient and high-quality services with affordable finance and ideas. For example, Japanese convenience stores are monopolized by three companies. These companies' stores are ubiquitous around Japan and they provide literary convenient services. Customers can buy magazines, underwear, and some special products, such as instant noodles which are featured by famous noodle restaurants. Customers can always buy the same products around Japan. Therefore, it must be difficult for local convenience stores to fight against large companies.\nSecondly, this phenomenon is not necessarily cause a negative effect on local businesses and communities. As I mentioned above, it will cause more convenient to local people. Furthermore, the people who used to run the local convenience store will be able to run the large companies' convenience stores as franchised stores by taking advantage of their own experience. Furthermore, running some stores and companies, instead of running only one company is getting standard for entrepreneurs because they can prepare for the fast-paced society. The more they can constantly increase their profit , the more options have on whether they should compensate for a deficit sales figure in a store or company. Furthermore, they can just terminate the company and focus on the profitable company. By doing this process, they can survive in the competitive society.\nIn conclusion, it is unpredictable which industries and services suddenly emerge and take place of their own business. Therefore, people always need to keep up with this fast-paced society.",

    "essay": "Due to globalisation the expanding of international brands and marketing is caughting on over years. This phaenomenon have caused the development and expansion of supermaket but also the closure of local businesses. I agree with the part of people who think that local business play a vital role in the life of local commuities that will be almost death in the next few years.\nIn Italy 50 years ago to buy food people had to go to street market. They used to buy km 0 products respecting the season of production of fruit of vegetables. People have to talk to each other, people have to go shopping respecting the workhours of people who had to produce the products and then sold them. In the last year, supermaket have caught on. Their goal is to offer how many products possible, without taking care of the season in which a certain product should be found in the market. For instace, if you want to buy cherries in winter now you can to to the nearest supermarket and find them, even if is November. By contrast, before supermarket's developement people had to wait the productive season of cherries and waint until summer to eat them. This phaenomenon had take people to prefer supermarket because they can find more products. However the consequences of this choice are in my opinion dramatic.\nFirst of all, the clousure of local business is causing a breakdown on the economical status of different countries. For instance, in Sicily there are still different people who work the ground and survive because they produce and sell their own products. It used to be their job. However, because of the supermakert their job is not apprecciated and they are losing money and the possibility to continue their job. This dramatic phaenomenon is surely causing the death of local communities because a vital part of the community itself is losing job. Another example coming from my personal experience might be the following. Nowadays you can buy a product to clean and polish your shoes in a supermaket. 50 years ago my grandfather used to go to the city center where a man used to clean and polish the shoes for him. It was his job. I had the extraordinary opportunity to meet this old man who clean and polish my shoes for little money. He was happy because, even if he is conscious that is almost impossibile, he hope to have the opportunity to do this job as long as possible. He told me that to clean shoes on the street for fifty years have given him the opportunity to meet people and to talk with them. After I have known him, I thought that because of globalisation we are losing our roots as well as the possibility of knowing our own place and people.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the phaenomenon of supermarket's expansion is causing the death of local communities. I also think that, although time changes and new habits are followed, we have at least to be conscious and recognise what we are losing.",

    "essay": "In some countries, the spread of supermarket has taken a significant proportion such that small shops may disappear. Many individuals believe that the shut down of local business could end the local communities. I fully consider that the generalisation of commercial market could destroy the spirit of localities because if owners closed their business, it would disappear local and familiar places for inhabitants and create a negative mental health.\nBefore having this modern invention, namely supermakets, local shops such as bakery or butcher have been there and where a place of regroupment and conviviality. However, due to the competitiveness of supemarket and the globalization of items, individuals may prefer to purchase in it rather than to go to each local business. This phenomenon decrease the visits of customers in small shops and would not help to boost their incomes. As a consequence, if local shops, which should be most of them in the city center due to old architecture such as in Europe, shut down, there will be no longer activities or inhabitants, and in the forthcoming decades, the city could be desertic.\nMoreover, small businesses created employment, if they closed, people would make redundants. Indeed, in many research when people lose their jobs, it may create a negative mood and at worst sometimes a depression. This is to say that if everyone were discharged due to all those shut down, effects could be detrimental on local communities. For instance, in small cities, many events are organized such as parties or barbecues. However, if the population had a negative mood, anyone would join these activities which, normally, increase the dynamism of a city.\nTo conclude, I fully think that supermaket is a harmful places for the well-being of localities because it could stop or curb cities' actions.",

Whilst\nthey can figure out few small shops around them to find what they want .\nTo summarize , some small business will continue to show necessary\nto be existance in our life althought rapid develoment in some countries and cities will evolve fast improvement in the way of marketing in order to find easy sloutions for shopping .",

I considered it is anachromism idea. Now the customer's purchasing value is totally diffrent with previous eras. Buyer start choose organic product and eco-friendlly or morality brand.

    "essay": "The education of children is surely one of the hottest topic debated. What are the subjects and the skills that children have to learn and what help them to grow up better? According to one view, art is vital for the growht of children and therefore it has to be a school subject. On the other hand, there are people who think that to do art at school is a waste of time. I believe that to study art is fundamental for at least two different factors and then it should be teached in the schools. Surely, more dignity should be deserved to it.\nTo study art at the different level of education is essential for the development of certain skills. First of all, those children who play with art develop the ability to measure, to structure a picture as well as delineate the border of a page earlier than those children who are not educated in drawing. They start recognising pictures and to distinguish between the colors and their possible mixtures. The second reason, by contrast, is linked with some psychological implications that to do art involves. To do art does not mean just to draw. Art can help adults to understand children and their needs. Children, thanks to the drawing activity, can start expressing their emotions and desire using pictures and colors. They can start working with their imagination before they learn the acquire the writing and reading skills. These two reasons lead some people to believe that is fundamental for children to do art. Then, art has to be a subject and considered as useful as Mathematics and English. The development of creativity and critical thinking that art implies is extraordinary useful. Indeed, children are led to understand practically what they have to do if they commit an error when they are drawing. They start to think about the errors they can made as possibility to do something new and original.\nBy contrast, there are people who dislike the idea that art can be compared to other subjects like Math and Science. They believe that art is more an hobby than something useful. Since there are no notions that a child can memorise and there are not test a teacher can prepare to understand the level of the children, art cannot be considered a subject. Therefore, there are no reasons to teach it in schools. However, the reasons presented by those who do not want to add art in the list of school subjects are misguided. They start from the idea that to learn means to stay hours in front of a book. This is obsiusly true but it is not enough. There is a fundamental part of learning that is advantaged by practical activities like art.\nIn conclusion, I believe that art is a subject and should be considered as such. The notions learnt by drawing are as essential as the first basis of grammar, keeping the necessary differences. Since children have to develop different skills, art as a school subject should be supported because it help children to develop at least creativity and critical reasoning as well as to express their emotions.",

    "essay": "It is believed by some that art is a fundamental subject in school, whilst it is considered by others as a waste of time. In my opinion, since only art permits the develop of children's creativity, it has to be considered as important as the other school subjects such as science or history.\nIn 2018, it was conducted a research among 100 children in which only half of them were following art classes. The resulting outcome was mind-blowing: in fact, those which had the opportunity to learn more about art had develop their creative skills, while the others, athough some of them had a natural talent, had not made any improvement. Hence, the result has underlined the importance of this subject.\nOn the other hand, some people think that children use the hours of art in school only to have fun and play with colours. I believe that this is partly true; however, since children have the right to express theirselves, this time in which art is taught plays an important role in their education. For instance, many studies have underlined that children suffering from ADHD (a psychological issue that causes hyperactivity), since they are using their energies painting and creating sculptures, can be calmer thanks to art.\nIn conclusion, I believe that art has to be taken into consideration with the same importance given to the other subjects because it leads to several benefits for children and, for this reason, teachers have the duty to teach them art properly, thus permitting children to become artists one day.",

    "essay": "Art, with its different types and genres, has been and will be an inseparable part of our children's developmental stage. Whether someone sees its value or not, art will one way or another find its way in our children's lives and have an influence. I strongly believe that art is crucial for our children to have as a subject at school and in this article I will try to explain why I believe so and give examples.\nOne of the major reasons why art is so essential is the diversity of the genres of art. Art could be in the form of playing music instruments, drawing, acting or even doing martial arts.\nThis diversity gives children the ability to choose what suits them best and focus on getting better at them. Not only that,but this also forms a big part of their personality. It is scientifically proven that this increases the average IQ of a child and it protects from depression later in the children's lives.\nOn the other hand, some parents have a different point of view, they see art as a distraction, believing that only merely scientific subjects are the real deal. However, their view may seem to look logical, as their wish is that their children would grow up to be doctors, scientists or something similar. I believe this is a noble goal but why not a doctor who can play a guitar? Or a scientist who is also a good actor ? Would not that be a great hobby to have in their free time?\nAn example that I encountered was when I started to learn martial arts and played the guitar and how this greatly helped me overcome a really tough time in my life and fight off depression.\nIn conclusion, I believe art is a subject that every student needs and to choose which suit them best later helps their lives drastically.",

    "essay": "It is commonly suggested that art is fundamental for the development of children, while others believe it is a non-essential subject for children which is taught in the schools. In this, I will discuss both the arguments and give my better opinion.\nTo begin with, That art subject is important for children's growth. Research shows that art is a creative way or language to depict the feelings of children while it also indicates that they are a better solution to release the stress by drawing. Some studies also suggested that they are a remedy to those who are suffering from anxiety or depression as it helps to release the oxytocin in the body to feel good.

In this, I will discuss both the arguments and give my better opinion.\nTo begin with, That art subject is important for children's growth. Research shows that art is a creative way or language to depict the feelings of children while it also indicates that they are a better solution to release the stress by drawing. Some studies also suggested that they are a remedy to those who are suffering from anxiety or depression as it helps to release the oxytocin in the body to feel good.

    "essay": "That of trasportation is a question that have troubled all the people over the world, whatever it is the city or town in which they live. In the last years people used to relying on the private car to move around. . Although the possible reasons that persuaded people to use private cars, the problems that rise from their excessive use, such us traffic and pollution, are harsh consequences to be accepted. I think that an improvement of public trasportation and to incentive the use of ecological means of trasport like bicycle should be possible solution to those issues.\nCars are considered the most confortable mean of trasport. In particular, if you have to move in a big cities like Milan. Indeed, means of trasports sometimes are late or full and also more unsafe. If you are a woman, for example, the use of public trasportation in some part of Italy is not safe mostly during the night hours. Another problem is that of comfort. If people use their car they can go whethever they want, when they want. If they have to spend more time in a place, they have not to be worried about the last bus they had to take to come back home.\nHowever, over-reliance of cars cause at least two big problmes: traffic and pollution. On the one hand, the problem of traffic will produce other issues such as anxiety and irritation. Indeed, if you have to go work in the morning and you live in a city like Rome you have to consider at least one hour spent in the traffic. Pollution is surely the most severe issue. Indeed, if all the people used to take a private car, then it is easely imaginable how much cars and fuel can be consumed daily. The two problems are linked, I want to underline, indeed, the noise pollution that derives from an intense traffic. It should be considered dangerous both for persons and animals.\nTwo possible solutions to the problem of the over-reliance on cars are the following. Firstly, public trasportation should be improved. Indeed, if bus and tram were more safe and more confortable, then people would be more tent by their use. At least, they will solve the problem of traffic. On the other hand, I see the echologycal means of transport like bycicle as the new border to pass in order to save the world from pollution. One possible suggestion would be that of make cheaper the bycicle and also to give an economic subsidy to those people who decide to help the planet using them.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the the use of private cars, because of the problems that it causes, should be discouraged. Two possible solutions rely on the improvement of public trasportation and on the incentive can be given to those using non-polluting means of trasport",

    "essay": "With development we encountered in industrial sector which have accompained with cities enlargement in some countries , the transportation became a serious issue we are facing lately . The following essay will illuminate the problems of people relying on private cars and possible solutios to deal with that .\nNowadays , people have to drive hours to arrive their works , schools and shops they determined . However , in order to arrive quickly and comfortably ,people tend to drive their own cars ,even though if they have to drive long distances . As a result of that , many issues are considered like, traffic congestion and pollution of environment. Furhtermore, buying cars are expensive and cost alot of saving money ,which can add more financial burden over mid class families. Moreover , having more cars on the road ,increase the risk for accidents which could be fatal in many conditions.\nHowever , having such problems had pushed governments to put plans to resolve them .For instance ,in some countires in Europe ,alot of money spent by governments to improve public tranport , also these countries encourage their people to use public transport by having low price tickets .In fact , today many people in France and Spain have decided to use subways , trains and buses as ulternative way to tranport . Likewise , in Canada , USA and Australia , as a result of having big lands ,big hospitals have offered to transfer some patients with critical medical conditions by heliocopters .\nIn summary . Although , disadvantages of driving long distances beside economic aspect of buying expensive cars , some people would rather to drive their personal cars in pursue their destinations. Nevertheless , if imporvement took place in public transport in term of quality in service and pricing of tickets ,then many individuals will get more benefits from public transport . Eventually people will be less dependant on cars and replace expensive vehicle with more economic way to travel .",

    "essay": "Nowadays, more and more people are using their own private car as the major means of transportation. But, overusage of car from people can lead to air pollution and destruction to the environment as greenhouse gases are produced, which are harmful to our body. To solve this problem, many countries are encouraging people to use electronic car or campaigning to use bus or train when they commute.\n2 weeks ago, I saw an environmental documentary from the television and I heard the cause of air pollution. There were many factors that could effect the air pollution, but one of the factors was the usage of the car. When we ride a car, the car produces harmful chemical gases such as carbon dioxide that lead to foggy weather. If we inhale this gases often, our lungs will become unhealthy and in worst case, lead to death. Therefore, over-reliance on cars will increase the number of people with lung disease as they produce bad chemicals.\nTo prevent production of harmful chemicals from the car, many people have to use bus or train for transportation rather than their private car, so government have to do campaign to use them and make festival to persuade people to use public transport. This will help the environment to reduce greenhouse gases and people to inhale more fresh air than before.\nIn conclusion, many people prefer to ride the private car as it is more comfortable, however, the consequences of usage of car are harmful to the environment and people's health, therefore government should educate or persuade people to use public transports instead of riding a car.",

    "essay": "Over the recent decades there has been a noticeable increase in the number of the private cars travelling both inside and outside the cities. This in turn has entailed various repercussions on people's lives. In this essay I will be trying to address a few pitfalls that might be resulted from the rising dependence on cars, and then I will try to consolidate some available solutions.\nWith the recent development in the car industry, private cars have been quite affordable products for a large portion of the society. Therefore, most of the people have started to travel by their own cars toward their destinations. This increase in vehicles traveling in the streets has alarmingly caused many traffic jams, and these in turn have costed the national economics enormous lost work hours. Moreover, the extent of the air pollution has been widened as a result of the increasing toxic materials emitted into the air. In addition, number of traffic accidents apparently has seen an expected surge, since it has a proportional relation to cars quantities travelling within the cities.\nIn order to minimize the problems mentioned above, a few solutions can be offered. First, governments should pour more money into developing the public transportation infrastructures, which might encourage employees to forgo their private cars and alternatively take the bus or train. Other notion which merits consideration, employers should intervene and organize group transits for transferring workers from and to their homes. In tourism circles, if there had been more focus on group packages, many tourists would have preferred to leave their cars at home.\nIn conclusion, I truly am of the opinion, that governments should take significant actions in order to decrease the use of private cars within their countries, in order to solve some of the inevitable problems resulted from the over-reliance on cars.",

    "essay": "In development countries they must allow works for people who have skills and experience employees from poor countries. I agree with this point of view because everyone they should have a chance. There were a opportunities and benefits.\nThe first point, I would like to make is that there were a great opportunities for both rich countries and people who came from poor areas. When people thinking to transfer abroad there were many reason but the most important when they want a chance to show of there craft and ability. Such as, Indian people they travelled many areas and they give them a lot of discoveries and skills; moreover, the rich countries need some people to help to make their country better place for living. For example, I have read an article in the newspaper they talked about development countries like UK, US and Arabic countries they need those people to improve their economy and life.\nThe second point, I will clarify is that there were many benefits when this countries allow jobs for those. They will be equality for all ;furthermore, there will be a improvement in living. For instance, I have saw a T.V decomontry they say \" In United States there are a equality and improvement in live between people they came from Africa\nand citizens they help them to have good education, skills and experience also they contribute the US economy to growth \".\nFinally, we can say that there were a opportunities and benefits for both sides. I am with this to have good life for all. I hope in the future poor countries they can take benefits from those people and developed their country to came better than now .",

Recently this trend has been more emphatic resulting in a disputable discussion which has been widely talked about. Should rich governments permit local workplaces to recruit foreign employees? I personally agree with this point of view and I will elaborate on the reasons in this essay.\nThere are several possible advantages of hosting employers from poor countries. First, foreign employees can bring with them new innovations and methods of research which in turn will enrich the local markets and possibly contribute to enhancing the knowledge. In addition, foreign employers are generally paid lower income in comparison to local workers, this could save up money for other investments.

    "essay": "The huge discrepancy between the rich countries and the poor ones is a constant of our society over the years. Although rich countries give financial supports to the poorer, it seems the problem of poverty is far from find a solution. Some people suggest to opt for other kinds of help. I partly agree with them, and I argue that financial skills and intellectual support should be integrated to the economical help the countries sent to the Third World.\nFinancial support is surely essential in order to help the poorer country to sane their situations. However, money without managment abilities are not useful enough. Indeed, governement of the so called Thrid World, since they do not possess managerial and investment's skills have no chance to make productive the money they used to receive. They can spend the money to solve the immediate issues they have to deal with without caring of the future perspective. For instance, nowadays countries used to send economical help to African countries. How do the poorer spend the money they receive? They built hospitals, schools and buy medicines and the primary necessity products they need. They cannot do more. This involve that as soon as the money and the resources they bought through them are finished, they cannot even mantain open hospitals and schools. They are again in poverty.\nWhat then do the poorer country need? Economical support is not enough. They need also professional people who have to teach them the managerial skill they need. For the development of their countries, it is essential to understand how to invest the money and how to make more money starting from the support poorer used to receive. They cannot do this by themselves, rather they need to be guided through the contemporary economical attituted that the richer countries have been developing over the years. The idea just presented is confirmed by the fact that the countries of the Third World are used to be defined the richer at least from the natural resources they have. Nonetheless, they cannot be able to exploit the natural capital they posses because of their lack of skills. Tanzania, for instance, is a place full of interesting products. However, they have not specialised people able to interact with the richer country in order to start a business. To send money without teaching them how they can use them, it is the same as to give to a child a bycicle without teaching him how riding. Once, a child has learned the technique behind the riding, he will never be worth knowing how to do it.\nIn conclusion, I believe that countries should integrate the \"how to do\". In other words, althought money are an essential help in order to permit the survival of people in the poorer countries, it is important that those less-lucky countries improve their managerial skills to go out from poverty.",

    "essay": "Yes, I agree that rich countries should also give other types of help rather than finantial aid.\nSome poor countries needs various types of help in order to develop themselfs. Educational help would have a major impact when associated with finantial help.\nWe can not interrupt the finantial help only by itself but we can ask for some accomplishments by the country which is receiving finantial help.\nFor example, a country would only receive next year finantial help if some rules or goals were accomplished by their government.\nEducational infrastructres, help for children in school like aquiring IT equipment and the development of internet conection which in some countries there isnÃÂ´t.\nBooks for children, meals during the school time would be very important, because it is trough education from very early that a country can develop itself.\nAnother example is in Agriculture field and environment. Frequently these countries have rudimentary forms of agricultre which demands old habits and dificult conditions for the farmers. A developed country when helping these countries, can also help with knowledgment, laws and protocols of agriculture. Today Agriculture has lots of technology helping farmers, businessmen and anyone linking with this area. Transmitting to these countries the tools and knowledge can also improve these countries to be more independent when we talk about agriculture. An organized agriculture department would mean less dependency of other coutries.\nThe environment is also a subject very important when talking about help to poor countries. It is a global issue, and these countries very often produce polluents. Transmiting them the importance in saving our planet it is a major goal. Again, knowledge, tools, forms of producing, technology can help not only the eficiency in the economy but also the environment. Transmitting the future generation the problems of our planet, the risks of global warming it is also a way to help.\nBasically the help has to be individual, because the poor countries have their own singular problems, and so, we have to check individually those countries in order to help eficiently. Some countries have wars, other ones donÃÂ´t even have organized governments. Other ones have organized governments and no wars but lack of basic needs such food, health and education. So it is important to not only help finantially but also dive in those countries individually on order to help efficiently.",

In addition, some developed countries ignore the help or just give a temporary solution. Poverty has a great effect on the income that can lead to serious problems.\nTo begin with, developed countries shouldn't only support with financial aid, as that kind of solution will not help the people. In my opinion, rich countries can stop poverty in such way to look for the natural resources of the poor country and to help and develop its resources. For example, in Africa they are famous for their large area of land. A rich country can take this opportunity to implement a long-term plan to benefit and fight poverty, such as to start expanding the lands of agriculture to use their natural resources such as cocoa, rice, and coffee. Furthermore, this idea can also help the people of the country where they can work on the land and be employed.\nAlso, developed countries can donate and build health care centers and schools to prevent the dangerous disease from spreading. Schools can empower children to grow up and help the country's economy to rise and to fight poverty.\nIn conclusion, developed countries can unite and discuss this significant concern rather than helping with financial support as poverty is taking the lives of many children.

    "essay": "Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to unprivileged countries rather than financial aid.\nI agree, for the most part, as we have seen from history, sadly the leaders of those countries aren't always thinking of helping their citizens with the money they got gifted. These world leaders could think of themselves first and satisfy themselves before they do anything else. Sometimes the world leaders don't help, after helping themselves they build their armies, and buy more weapons for more destruction. Before countries decide to help other countries with financial aid, they should analyze the world leader and see what type of world leader they could be. If the world leader shows any signs of selfishness, money won't help their citizens, it doesn't help with their situation at all. When the citizens find out their world leader isn't helping them with the financial aid, they could go violent and cause riots, revolutions, and a huge decrease in currency strength, which will increase poverty, homelessness, and famine.\nOn the other hand sending resources such as beverages, clothes, and books to help increase the number of educated people in the country would be far more useful. unfortunately, these types of countries have a problem with education among the citizens, many citizens want to educate themselves but aren't able to. Food and clothes help as well, many civilians don't have the privilege to warm themselves up, or get full. This will help with their quality of life.",

    "essay": "In recent years, technology has been developing and people are busy keeping up with progress. For this reason, some people state that people, including students need to learn cutting-edge technology, such as IT program outweigh the importance of learning history. Furthermore, they often state there is no value of learning history. Although some people's opinions are understandable to some extent, I strongly believe people continuously need to learn history to recognize modern social issues. I would like to state some reasons and examples to support my opinion.\nInitially, people have a long history of how they improved their lifestyles drastically and violently from ancient times around the world. People kept fighting to increase their country's territory and caused innumerable victims. In addition, there were slaves who were occupied by invaders. As a result, they were often forced to move to another continent, such as America for the workforce and looked down on slaves. If people ignore learning this historical background, they will continue fighting and discriminating against them. Therefore, learning history will lead to how necessary to treat human rights equally.\nSecondly, when it comes to the environment, there are several issues. Some disasters and global warming are triggered by human's sustainable long historical actions. After the Industrial Revolution that occurred in the 18th century, we consumed a lot of resources such as oil and coal, and the carbon dioxide emissions caused climate change such as global warming.\nIn addition, repeated deforestation led to floods and a sharp decline in native species. Unless people know the reason why such a revolution happened by history, people will take another action that is harmful to the global environment.\nFinally, the causes of our modern society's problems as I mentioned above can be recognized by studying history. People need to take responsibility for a peaceful and eco-friendly society by considering a variety of views in history.",

    "essay": "Some people claim that nothing about the past is valuable for life in the present day. From my perspective, it is not true. I disagree with this statement because people can, indeed, learn significantly from previous human behaviours and nature patterns, as it often happens in cycles, in other words, it is repeated from time to time, so it proves that one day the knowledge gained might be useful in the future. Additionally, many discoveries and pieces of research, that were made in the past, applies to the present time.\nAt first, it has been proved by many geologists that, despite the global warming, the weather follow a cycle pattern. This way, it is possible to predict the future challenges that the humankind will likely face, such as seasons of extremely low or high temperatures. Moreover, the same trend applies to the human behaviours. It is known that some situations will probably be repeated, such as wars and economic crisis, and this is considered part of humans' evolution. Therefore, knowing that many aspects will likely happen, in a similar way, in the future, proves that the knowledge about the past is relevant.\nBesides that, it is valid to state that many discoveries from earlier ages, such as the medicines and the technology advance, are vital for nowadays life. People should not take them for granted, as most of the things that the global population has achieved, once, depended on the previous researches.\nIn conclusion, individuals should, indeed, learn from the past.

I disagree with this statement because people can, indeed, learn significantly from previous human behaviours and nature patterns, as it often happens in cycles, in other words, it is repeated from time to time, so it proves that one day the knowledge gained might be useful in the future. Additionally, many discoveries and pieces of research, that were made in the past, applies to the present time.\nAt first, it has been proved by many geologists that, despite the global warming, the weather follow a cycle pattern. This way, it is possible to predict the future challenges that the humankind will likely face, such as seasons of extremely low or high temperatures. Moreover, the same trend applies to the human behaviours. It is known that some situations will probably be repeated, such as wars and economic crisis, and this is considered part of humans' evolution. Therefore, knowing that many aspects will likely happen, in a similar way, in the future, proves that the knowledge about the past is relevant.\nBesides that, it is valid to state that many discoveries from earlier ages, such as the medicines and the technology advance, are vital for nowadays life. People should not take them for granted, as most of the things that the global population has achieved, once, depended on the previous researches.\nIn conclusion, individuals should, indeed, learn from the past. Firstly, because some situations can, similarly, happen again, and secondly, because it is the way to fully understand our recent achievements and our modern life.",

    "essay": "Learning about the past may provide advantages and disadvantages, depending on the position we are situate ourselves in life ;\nUndoubtedly, it has great advantages for the ones who need to progress in life, despite what they had been through, because to my opinion, greatest lessons in life come with our own experiences. Advantages of learning about the past are also on the side of the ones who personally know themselves very well and stay honest to themselves at all times.\nFor example, someone who try to be someone, acting to please influent people or trying to get somewhere he or she would not be able to if he were playing real, could be embarrassed by their own mistakes or feeling humiliated when looking back to what he accomplished to get where he/she is now ; therefore the past in this situation would not be a great option for him to look back after.\nDespite this kind of personality, there are lots of people who find out constructive knowledge in looking back to the past, regardless of how great or bad it could be.\nThe kind of people who actually face their own past and do not try to hide it are the ones who are not scared of how people will judge them, but are willing to make greate changes in their future.\nIt is ,to me, the definition of true progress; how could we learn from our own experiences if we are not willing to face ourselves ?\nPast can be hurtful but I do think that everything we have been through is a constructive lesson for today and tomorrow.",

    "essay": "Is competition instructive or toxic for children? There is a debate around this topic. There are those who believe that a sense of competition should be supported. On the other standpoint, there are those who believe that rather that compete children have to learn how to co-operate. I believe that supporters of competicions are partly right but also that co-operation between children is essential. The two strategy can be taken together to give to childrens all the tools they need to became useful adults.\nOn the one hand, there are people who believe that to compete is essential for the growth of children. They believe that competitions rise the ambitions of children. They develop certain attitudes thanks to which they will have always bigger dreams and desire. The idea, therefore, is that children who have grown making competiions will became important managers because of their instinctive desire to be winners and successful persons. It is true that competitions permit childrens to develop their ambitions and to do the best they can in order to win. However, I strongly believe that a good understanding of the aim of competitions should be taught before they start to compete. Indeed, children have to understand the instructive role of competition and how manage the possible distructive consequences that could derive if a child is not ready to lose. Children should start a competition being aware of the possibility of lose and the possibility to win. I believe that is important to stimulate children in doing competitions but teaching them the important role of defeats and the role of coperation. This lead me to analyse the second standpoint.\nThere are, indeed, people who dislike competitions at all. They believe they are toxic for the growth of children. According to them, it is negative to teach children to be against between each other. Rather, children should learn how to work together and co-operate. Surely, co-operation is a vital skill in workplaces. The ability to work in team is one of the most searched by different businesses. To learn how to work together means for children to understand their role in a group and also to think about the ideas that should support the team itself. Co-operation then permits children to develop fundamental social skills. However, co-operation alone is not enough for children's instruction. I believe that co-operation is possible just if a child is also learning how to work and produce something alone. Children, in order to advances ideas and give a good support in a team, have to learn to be ambitious and this is possible thanks to competitions.\nIn conclusion, I believe that an instruction in which single competitions as well as team-works are encouraged is the most useful and productive in order to grow up efficient adults.",

    "essay": "Some people think by encouraging a sense of competition in the youngster can lead to the development of a strong personality and determined mind. But, others think youngsters who were taught to share and be corporative will turn into helpful adults.\nThe sense of competition indeed can generate excitement and can push youngsters to give their best. On the other hand, the competitive feeling can cause hatred among children, especially if the parents were pressuring their child to always take the lead. For example, when I was nine years old I used to have a friend in my class that had a great sense of competition. She often caused problems when she lose or answered wrong. Unfortunately, the teacher got to know with the encouragement of her parents the girl felt pressured and the fear of disappointing them. In addition, parents can teach their children to co-operate and to engage with other youngster, to motivate them and to help them learn how to share, which can become a great experience when they get older and be more understanding and considerate.\nHowever, a sense of competition is not always frustrating it can encourage a youngster to develop new behavior that can help them to discover adventurous journeys. Furthermore, being competitive among children might attract shy children to engage more and break the wall of fear.\nIn my opinion, teaching children to co-operate is far better than being competitive. It can improve children behaviour in positive way.\nIn conclusion, while people agree to encourage children to have sense of competition, I agree that childern can share and help each other without the need of being competitive.",

    "essay": "There is a debatable issue regarding competition and cooperation. Some people hold that adolescents should be encouraged to compete, while others disagree and argue that teaching children to work together is more important. This essay will analyse both positions and illuminate my standpoint.\nAs for those highlighting the importance of competition, these people may have their position grounded upon the fact that children can learn a lot by competing against each other, especially when they encounter numerous obstacles brought by their strong opponents and suffer failures. Only under such adverse conditions can children understand their drawbacks and the ways of improvement. Apart from that, if children have hard-earned victories over competent rivals, they are likely to gain tremendous pleasure of success as well as huge confidence that motivates them to keep working diligently and achieve more success.\nOn the contrary, in terms of those attaching greater importance to cooperation than to competition, these people may justify their position by citing a large number of examples elucidating the role of collaboration in various tasks, such as the production of a high-tech gadget of which the parts are manufactured by different countries, and a formal meeting where people present their respective views on a given issue in order to comprehenively understand the situation. Admittedly, these examples sufficiently explain the importance of cooperation. However, this does not mean that cooperation must outweigh competition since the two ways of interaction influence us differently and it is rather impractical to identify which one is more influential to us.\nTo sum up, competition and cooperation benefit us in different ways. It is hardly possible to conclude which one is more important to us.",

    "essay": "Different people used to spend their leisure time in different ways. There is a debate conserning the activities that should be porsued during the free time. There are people who think that it is important to enrich mind with cultural activities such as reading books and doing word puzzles. On the other hand, there are those who suggest that leisure time is made to relax the mind. I believe that a balance between the two extreme views is the better solution.\nIt is very important to give to coltivate our mind with culture. Reading a book, listen to classical musing, play games in which problem solving tricks should be sold is a funny way to spend your time and at the same time exercise the brain. To spend 15 minutes playing a game in which you have to solve math problems or doing world puzzles can be considered as the mental counterpart of the physical workout. To read a book had always been considered as the best way to learn without studying. Another interesting way in which the brain should be trained is by playing an instruments. To focus on some activities that will encourage the development of your skills and more stimuli on your brain is surely one of the best way to spend a part of your leisure time.\nOn the other hand, it is also important to rest. Also your brain need a break. While it is easy to rest your body by sitting on the sofa it is not equally easy to stop your brain and to give to it a break. Listening to classical music, listening to the sounds of the nature, to have a nice walk, do meditations are some ways in which you can rest your mind. Even if it will be time in which the brain is on pause, some positive effect will be noted. Indeed, after only 30 minutues the brain will be recharged and full of energy.\nIn conclusion, I believe that a balance between intellectual activities and total rest of the brain will be the best solution to give to the mind both stimuli and time to recharge itself. Although the positive effects that will be obtained by spending leisure time in activities that improve the mind, the brain like a computer need sometimes to be put in a standby mode, even if just for a very brief period.",

    "essay": "In the last years the problem of global warming is becaming more and more debated. One of the main causes of the temperature rising are men-made activities. Almost all the activities made by humans produce a huge impact on the natural environment. For instance, some of the usual activities made daily by people are impacting. Indeed, the chemical products they buy and use as well as the ways of trasportation's abuse can be annoverated among the main reasons for global warming. Lastly, even if it is the more impacting, there is the industral system and their production of slags.\nThe first impact made by men-activities concerns the product they use. There are at least three kinds of products that may cause the rising of temperature. First, there are products like lacquaer and foam. Because they were beed uncontrolled used during the last decades, they have been one of the main causes of the Ozone Hole. Spray products, even if they are just suncream or hair conditionars could be very impacting because of their chemical composition. Another men-activity that impact a lot on the environment concern their use of the way of transportation. Indeed, the abuse of private ways of trasportation caused an increasement of pollution and a dramatic increase of the level of petrol in the environment. Petrol is not only one of the main reason for global warming but also the first responsible for sea's pollution. Furthermore, the dayly use of flight cause pollution in the air and now restriction on the abuse of this way of trasportation are trying to be a kind of solution to the problem.\nLastly, one of the main causes of global temperatures higher is the industrial system. Indeed, they used to point to the cheaper solution to produce and eliminate the radioactive waste. The problem of a prodaction that does not take care of the environment pointed to use polluting products and machines. Furthermore, the industrial system point to produce more and more causing the waste of energy and raw materials. For instance, the fashion industry is one of the more pulluting in the world. It abuses of materials and energies whithout caring abuut the waste of them. Finally, the problem of the way in which the industries procede in elimnating waste is crucial. Indeed, in the last years they used to disperse the waste on the sea. This tendecy was increased for two reasosns: saving and speed. These are the two eassential words of industrial system.\nIn conclusion, I think there are two main reasons that cause the raising of global temperatures that can be annoverated among the others. Those that concern the personal and daily activities of men (use of determinate products and ways of trasportation) and then those activities operate by the industrial system.",

    "essay": "Two centuries ago, when people celebrated the evolutionary development brought by industrialization, no one would ever anticipate that a profound change of global climate would be caused by the Ã¢ÂÂmachinesÃ¢ÂÂ humans had made. However, many ecologists point out that human activities have put a massive burden on the ecosystem, which leads to increasingly higher global temperatures. This essay will explain the major causes of global climate change, followed by several plausible solutions.\nIt has been widely recognized that excessive greenhouse gas emissions are the culprit of global climate change, and burning fossil fuels and consuming oil are the leading causes of greenhouse gas emissions. First, our daily life in a modern society heavily relies on electricity, acquired mainly through burning fossil fuels like coal. A colossal amount of smoke, predominantly carbon dioxide, is released during this process. As a result, the smoke captures excessive heat on the Earth, resulting in an increase in global temperatures. Second, consuming oil impacts global temperatures in the same way. As the energy from burning fossil fuels cannot meet the rapidly growing needs, more and more oil extraction programs are set up to acquire petroleum. The process of both drilling oil and consuming it creates a significant amount of greenhouse gases. Thus, burning fossil fuels and consuming oil are significant causes of climate change.\nHowever, although lowering greenhouse gas emissions is challenging, several actions could decelerate the effect. One major step is to urge the energy-dependent companies to reduce productivity and create more jobs in green industries. Like large cloth manufacturers, giant companies need a significant portion of energy to keep their machines running every day. By reducing productivity, the amount of energy they need can drop. At the same time, the government should increase investment in green industries to maintain a healthy employment rate. On the other hand, individuals can make their own contribution by reducing their personal carbon footprints. Every small step, such as turning off the lights when leaving home, taking public transportations instead of driving cars, or simply eating less meat, can make big changes.\nIn conclusion, the excessive greenhouse gas emissions released mainly by burning fossil fuels and consuming oil have caused an alarming increase in global temperatures. Nevertheless, this problem could be alleviated by a collective effort of giant companies and individuals.",

    "essay": "Global warming is a serious global threat that no one can deny. The causes of making temperatures higher can be for various reason, but rencently there is a growing evidence that man-made activties are causing it. Man-made activites such as pollution can be one of the causes. Nowadays, we must focus on how we can deal with them and solbe the problem. This essay will include the causes and the solution on why our earth temperature is increasing.\nAt first, we are polluting the earth without realizing the threats or problems that this can cause in the future, that is because of the unawarness of our society. One of the main causes of the rising temperatures is factories. Factories production can cause severe air pollution, because of the burning waste or by blowing air that include chemicals out to the fresh air. The current rise of temperature is alarming. Deforestation is another reasons to this problem. Deforestation is caused by humans to sell it or use for our own benefit, but in reality we are killing planet earth.\nTo every problem there are solution. Since we are already in this problem; we better find a solution before it is too late. Even though there are man-made activites that are causing the problem, but there are some that can solve it. The introduction of electronic car is the beginning of the solution, where the use of diesel are decreased to make our vehicles more eco-friendly. As we can see today, restaurants and cafes are serving plastic straws; even though, this will not solve the problem immediately, but it is a good start to make our life more friendly to our environment.\nIn conclusion, global warming is a serious issue that must not be avoided. Although, we did put ourselves in this position, but we will also be able to fix it. The causes that drove us to this problem are used for a long time. However, reducing the amount of factory production or introducing eco-friendly machinery can be our way out.",

    "essay": "Despite knowing about the adverse effects of climate change, human activities have been highly responsible for global warming for decades. This essay will discuss the main causes of temperature rising including the excessive use of fossil fuels and plastic pollution. This essay will further suggest solutions to these problems including decreasing the consumption of fossil fuels and reducing the dumping of waste in the sea.\nMost people are guzzling fossil fuels, churning out greenhouse gases and messing with our planet's climate like there's no tomorrow. For instance, driving to the grocery store burns a certain amount of fuel, resulting in an increase in carbon footprint. The combustion of fossil fuels emits CO2, which in turn traps heat in the atmosphere, hence making it the primary contributor to global warming. Moreover, dumping plastic in oceans deprive phytoplanktons of sunlight. As a result, the planktons are not able to carry out photosynthesis, a process that removes CO2 and releases oxygen, which leads to disruption of the world's carbon cycle and ultimately makes the planet warmer. Thus human activities that contribute to an escalation in CO2 emissions are the prime causes of a rise in global temperature.\nSubstituting fossil fuels with other renewable energy sources and reducing plastic usage are both critical to mitigating this phenomenon. For example, people should install solar lights in their homes instead of Led bulbs. We should also curb the buying of processed or canned foods and should always take our own paper bags while going  grocery shopping to prevent the use of plastic bags. Furthermore, using public transportations rather than private vehicles for commuting would significantly alleviate our carbon footprint. Therefore, if humans shift to renewable and recyclable materials then it would drastically minimise the temperature rising issues.\nTo conclude, people's actions that change the environment have a negative impact on the global climate. However, we can substantially lessen it by curbing fossil fuels and plastic usage.",

    "essay": "While some people argue that equal numbers of male and female students should be accepted in every major, I personally disagree with this statement.\nThere are a number of arguments that can support my stance. To begin with, it is impossible to enroll equal genders of students in every subject. It is true that some faculties are underrepresented by a particular gender. For example, STEM subjects usually have more male students than females, but the opposite is true in educational-related subjects, which phenomenon seems to violate the principle that we fight endeavor today, gender equality. Therefore, people want to accept equal numbers of students to achieve a gender balance in every subject. However, the reality is that different genders prefer to study different subjects themselves, but not because of the unequal opportunity. According to one of the research, women show a higher interest in subjects like education, psychology and arts rather than science-related subjects. As a result, it is apparent that admitting equivalent proportions of male and female students can hardly be achieved.\nIn addition, it will deprive students of chances to make their own choices if universities enroll both genders equally in every subject mandatorily. It should be noted that it is students' right to select the subjects freely in college. If students cannot register for the subjects they want to study just because there are not enough quotas left for particular gender of students, or they are forced to study some subjects they are not interested in just because they need to fulfill the gender requirement in the class, it will hinder students' learning in the long-run.\nTo conclude, universities should not enroll equal gender students in every subject as it is impossible to achieve and may deprive students the freedom to choose the major they want to study.",

    "essay": "Some people believe that educational facilities must accept the same numbers of men as women in every subject. There are both pros and cons in this argument, which will be discussed in this essay.\nA tremendous number of people think that equality is crucial for education. Nowadays, more and more activists fight for women's rights. They want that every female can study everything that she prefers, notwithstanding this is socially acceptable or not. Moreover, many feminists suggest that patriarchal societies do not allow women to study equality with men. For example, when a little boy says to his younger sister that she is not intelligent enough for the men's play, a little girl grows up and thinks that she cannot study men's subjects and work men's jobs. Therefore, the main reason to accept equal numbers of both sexes is to crush many stereotypes about women's intellectual abilities and allow them to choose which subject they really want to study.\nOn the other hand, some people can complain that this is discrimination against men. For instance, if every university will accept only 50% of men with the highest grades in every subject, men with average grades but higher than women's will not be accepted. Furthermore, this idea does not guarantee that all wise women will study in universities. Females also can do not want to learn every existing subject.\nIn conclusion, the main point of equality in education is about choice, not coercion. From my point of view, that would be great if male and female students could study the same subjects; if more boys prefer to be teachers, while more girls like to be scientists. However, this is impossible when a lot of stereotypes exist, and the coercion of universities to accept balanced numbers of students based on their genders does not help solve the global issue with equality.",

    "essay": "Regarding education, gender equity is crucial. Some people argue that universities should enrol an equal number of men and women in every field. Personally, I totally agree with that statement because I believe it is fairer and it is better for the society.\nThe main reason male and female students should be equal in number is that it would be more equitable. In fact, numerous studies have stated that their brains are not working the same way. In other words, their cognitive capacities are different, so they should not compete with each other for university admissions. It does not mean that a gender is more intelligent than the other. For example, men are generally known to have a better spacial orientation, while women's ability to memorize is superior. Similarly, their physical capacities are not the same either, and that is why men and women do not compete against each other in sports competitions.\nAnother reason to separate sexes regarding university admissions is because it ensure a better distribution of gender among the labor market. Broadly speaking, it is well known that males work, in their life, more hours that females. This is principally due to the fact that women take more maternity leave than men. Unfortunately, it can consequently create a problem in the society.For example, nowadays, women represent the majority of students in medicine as they have better grades in high school. As a result, there is not enough working staff in hospitals when they quit to take care of their families. The same situation applies to every field with a majority of women such as jobs in health services.\nIn conclusion, I reiterate that there should be an equal number of male and female students enrolled in universities because it would be more equitable and ensure a better repartition of genders among different fields of employment.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, universities are accepting all the students, as many men as women in every subject matter. I believe that being open to all students is fair. The university must allow everyone to study what is interesting for each individual, regardless of gender.\nHowever, I think that the numbers of equality in each course are statistically speaking unrealistic. Even though, in general, I completely agree that there must be equality and human rights.\nNowadays, many are the organizations created, to support equality, sex discrimination, with the aim of helping people to get their rights. However, despite enormous positive changes compared to the past, still, some people reckon that some jobs are for women and others for men. What does it even mean? Should a woman only do house chores and raise kids? As can be seen, based on women's experience, a woman can be a businesswoman and a great mother at the same time. There is an old saying, 'Give me an educated mother and I will give you an educated nation'. Therefore, I disagree with some people's beliefs. Men and women can be great in different jobs and positions.\nHowever, having the same number of students in each course is impractical for universities. Realistically speaking, there are some courses which attract more one gender than the other. In terms of numbers, if we think that, for instance, in the nursery degree there is 50 % of females and, then the other half will be waiting to be filled form males, it would be harsh for the university to close the course with the same parity of future students.\nIn a nutshell, universities should not accept only one gender for a particular course or most of that gender with a fixed number. As the applications arrive at the university, they should select people based on their skills, knowledge, and merits. No matter if the course will be 80% females and 20% male or vice versa.",

Hence, I believe it is the responsibility of individulas as well as governments and large companies.\nIndividuals can do a lot to improve the environemt around them starting with taking some actions to make a difference. For example, every memeber in the sociaty can support recycling efforts by sorting their garbages into different categoreis, instead of wasting the efforts of recycling companies to do so. Another exmaple would be to stop using plastic products and replace them with more environemt friendly products like pepar products.\nMoreover, teaching and spreading awarness about the importance of keeping our environemt clean are another way to make a difference. For instance, we can use social media to spread awarness and start campaigns about enviorment and pollution. Furthermore, we can teach some classes in schools and universities about this subject. As a result, this will help the upcoming generations to understand the problem and have them continue the efforts of improvement.\nWhile individuals efforts are essential, they must be supported by governments and large companies in order to complete the circle. A main example here would be establishing regulations and laws that would minimze the damage to the environment and maintain pollution at low levels, which is the role of the governments around the world. As for large companies, they can support by adopting the best practicies and take the proper actions to reduce pollution and improve the environment. As an example, they can start using clean and renewable energies to power their facilities and plants. In addition, those companies can develop technologies that contributes toward keeping the environment safe, and prompet the use of clean energy and vehicales.\nTo sum up, the responsibility to improve the environemt must be divided between all three parties individuals, governments, and large companies. Each has his role to enhnace the environemnt and reduce the pollution. They complete each other and they should work together toward a better future for our world.",

Although, regional towns are small and provide a simple lifestyle, I still think that large cities offer a better lifestyle and much better facilities.\nIt is true that regional towns have a simpler lifestyle and are not completely industrialized, which leads to a better environment and healthier people. Some people say that large cities have a few problems like traffic and high population. I, however, believe that the advantages of living in a big city, completely outweigh the disadvantages.\nFirstly, Due the modernisation and globalisation of industries, various multinational companies look for employees and are usually situated in urban areas. People move from rural areas to urban towns to look for employment with higher salaries as well as international exposure. Secondly, cities have a vast network of transportation available which is more frequent and comfortable for the commuters. Many people from small towns transit through big cities for inter-state or international travels. Lastly, large towns provide better accommodation for people with better living facilities. They have huge buildings with many apartments which are very well structured. These buildings also have facilites like gym, pools, grocery shops e.t.c. so that residents don't have to travel far. Which is why, when people move from small towns, it is easier for them to rent a room according to their budget and requirements.\nIn conclusion, While I strongly believe that one should visit regional towns from time to time to freshen up their mind and body, I completely disagree with the fact that people should be encouraged by the government to permanently move to these areas .",

    "essay": "The problem of understainding whether there is an age that could be consider perfect to have a child is very debated. It is nowadays very common to have children over 40 years old. After explaining the reasons besides this tendency (a different life-style and conception of education and the role that women play in our society), I will argue in favour of this tendency by explaining that the disadvantages can be outweighed.\nThe reasons why today people have children in their later age are due to two factors. Firstly, there is a new conception of education and people when finish their studies sometimes have to wait years before finding a good paid position. On the other hand, new technologies and new medical treatments have made people around 60 looking in the same way as my grandmother was in her 40. The central cause of this tendency is surely linked with the role that women play in our society. They study and work and they have to find a good job position in the same way as their male counterparts have to do. This involve that a woman cannot take the time that she need to grow up a child when she is 25 (at that age she is usually in Academia yet). Rather, she will think about the possibility of having a child after started her career. Then, there are positive effects produced by this new tendency. Children are loved and considered by their parents as miracles. On the other hand, they can grow up in a family in which his parents have good jobs. Neither the mother or the father have to sacrifice a part of their life because they had a child too young.\nMy mum got me when she was over 40. Twenty-three years ago this was consider an exception. Although I confronted my-self with the possible disadvantages that could be produced by having child late, I cannot present them as real issues. People believe that a not-young parent cannot understand your needs and your thoughts. However, this is false. Indeed, If a person is open-minded, she will always is, whatever the age. The only possible disadvantage concerns the fear of losing your parents soon. While people start to think about the possible death of their parents when they are around 30 years old, I started to think about that when I was 20. But it is just fear. Therefore, I believe that there are not concrete reasons to be against this tendency. If we start to conceive the idea of having a baby as an immense gift, we will reasonably have to understand that we have to be prepared to grow up the child and to dedicate to him all the time he needs. Then, it is amazing if this is possible to have all of this when a woman is 25. But, if the family (father and mother together) wants to start their career first, they cannot be judged. There is not a perfect moment to have a child. Sometimes to wait involve do better.\nIn conclusion, I believe that there are not disadvantages to be outweighted. The two possible disadvantages I presented are not worst than those people having children at their young age have to deal with.",

This essay will discuss why it is dangerous and give you some evidences.\nIncreasing the costs of daily necessary items for example, these days if you go to the grocery shop and just buy the simply needs vegetables or fruits you will end up with a very significant amount of money payment. Consequently, with that the majority of population tend to become a finically stable before getting a kid.\nUnfortunately, giving birth to a baby in fourteen is critical and there is a lot of sequences following that. In order that It is required more attention and care for that topic we should develop a program to teach the parents with no exception because some of mothers seems they are unlikely to have awareness of the difficulties.\nProvided that there was a case I remember just passes to my mind of a pregnant women cames to the emergency room in a disaster situation then turn on that if she gives birth, there could be possibility of one of them will die (her or the baby), simply because she was very old in her fourteen.\nIn summary, some people restricted to finical part and forgetting a more important one which is the safety of the women as well as the fetus.",

    "essay": "Over the past decades, it has been registered a considerable decrease in the percentage of people eager to create a family at a young age. There could be different reasons for this and I am going to state them clearly in the following paragraphs, which will also explain why I believe the advantages of this situation far outweigh the disadvantages.\nApparently, the society we currently live in has undergone substantial changes over the years, sometimes without us even noticing it. The most evident of these variations has probably been the gradual rise in the number of old people as opposed to the dramatic fall in the number of births. In fact, owing to the decline of the economy of most nations and the subsequent reduction of work opportunities, more and more people are giving up on the idea of becoming parents in their 20s or 30s. Many people see this as a negative aspect for our society; however, I have to strongly disagree with their opinion.\nThe drawbacks to which a lot of people point out when discussing about these kind of topics often has to do with the age gap between parents and their children. Admittedly, someone cannot decide to have a child in their 40s without considering the significant generation gap that would separate them from their kids and, as a result, the issues of miscommunication that could arise.\nHowever, the disadvantages become of secondary importance as soon as the much more remarkable benefits are examined. First of all, older parents also means more responsible and mature caretakers; consequently, due to their broader life experience, they would arguably make better advisors for their kids. Not to mention that older parents would not only have more stable and secure jobs, but they would also have more consistent savings to devote to their children's further education, which in turn could help the latter having a better and well-paid job in the future.\nTo conclude, although it's impossible not to take into account the drawbacks of having a child at a more advanced age, the advantages still outrun the disadvantages. Thus, children would be the first to benefit from such a situation.",

    "essay": "It is true that today, people tend to give birth when they are older than their previous generation. This trend has several negative and positive effects on their daily life.\nOn the one hand, there are several disadvantages for those who want to have children in their later age. First, moms could suffer from many serious health problems when they give birth late. Those who are older than 35 of age has the higher rate of death because their hormone levels are not suitable for giving birth which lead to medical accidents. Second, boys or girls whose their mother is older than 35 also tend to suffer from many problems. For example, it is easier to have pneumonia for children from those mothers because the preterm birth rate of this group of mothers is higher.\nOn the other hand, I am on the side with those who believe that there are more benefits to having children when they are older. Firstly, people could prepare a better foundation for their children. Raising a boy or a girl is a job which needs both much effort, money and time. Therefore, many people decide to work hard and earn much money they can because it could build a more solid infrastructure for their children. Secondly, it is important for children to have both their parents during their process of growing up. The rate of crime in terms of teenagers, who grow up without mother or father, is higher than those who live with parents. Thus, the decisions such as having marriage or giving birth are crucial when the younger tend to decide quickly.\nIn conclusion, it is still controversy for this trend because of the positive and negative effects mentioned above.",

    "essay": "At present, it is possible to note that families come in different and diverse structures. Overall, these changes occur because of women are entering the work force, which changes the roles of a traditional family. I strongly believe that these changes are positive to society and to the economy. In the following paragraphs I will present my reasons to have such opinion.\nOne major factor that affects family structures is women being allowed to work outside their homes. Within the last century, women joined the work force, modifying the traditional family setting that was compoused by men being the ones who provided for their families. Therefore, the roles changed as both mothers and fathers could financially provide for their children. Moreover, women do not need to rely on their husbands to raise children as they have jobs themselves, and they might even decide to raise a baby by their own, creating a new type of family strucutre that is comprised of only a mother and a child. Furthermore, couples can even decide not to have children at all, and only focus on their carreers, as women have the possibility of being a lot more than mothers.\nThese changes are definitly positive of an economical and societal point of view. Women are now part of the work force, therefore, they contribute for the economy. Besides that, changes in family structures and roles make people more tolerant, as they see that there is no limitation for what a women can do.\nTo summarize, there are indeed several changes occurring in families structures, and the roles people play in it. Women being part of the work force has changed male and female contribution to a family, which has a positive impact, socially and economically speaking.",

    "essay": "In our modern days, families had witnessed a considerable change regarding their structure and the roles of individuals inside it. These changes are mainly the patriarchal structure that was dominating families in the past compared to a more balanced arrangement nowadays. In addition to that, there are more freedom and rights for women in recent years. And I believe its an advantageous development.\nFathers used to be the only leaders of the families of past decades, however in recent days mothers had shared the leadership and started taking part in family decisions just like their partners. Also during recent decades women obtained greater deal of their civil rights which allowed them to take different roles from those that were common for females in the past decades. As an example, women can now own the family house, sign important documents, drive cars which were a breakthrough for women to be able to participate in family plannings and decisions.\nIt appears to be an advantage to have women being able to be effective members of their families, that is because they can share responsibility, add their feminine qualities to the lives of their families as well as for them to be able to fulfill their own life by feeling the importance of their existence and their roles.\nAs in a recent research that found families with women in them are happier, more content, and definitely healthier.\nIn conclusion, the family system nowadays differs vastly from before, owing to the more roles that women are taking, and to the more rights and freedom they gained, and in my perspective it is a positive change.",

    "essay": "As the '70s of the last century started, the world lived a social revolution that led to a change in the family structure and in family roles' conception.\nI believe these changes are positive and take people to be more inclusive towards all forms of love: heterosexual and homosexual. The social revolution permitted also women to impose their role in the workplace as leaders and not just in the house as mothers.\nIn the last decades a revolution concerning the concept of family led to conceive the couple and not just the married heterosexual couple with at least a child as complete and valued families. This social step is crucial since before that people who loved a person of the same sex as well as women who decided to have no child were treated by society as the maker of the family collapse. In Sicily, for instance, where there is still a lot of work to be done in this respect, it was almost crazy to define a group of people composed of a woman and a man with a son born outside marriage to fall under the concept of family. Therefore, I believe that this social change is taking people to believe step by step that all forms of love must be respected and most crucially they are starting to understand the concept of family as the non-physical place in which love lives.\nThe role of women in the workplace and in the house radically changed in the same years. The revolution concerned both the conception of women as free independent workers who obtain leadership positions as well as the conception of women as wifes and mothers. Indeed, women are no anymore required to live their life trying to make the house perfectly clean, satisfy the husband's desires and grow up the children. At the same time, husbands discover again their role as fathers and not just as money-maker of the house. Thus thanks to social change women can dedicate time to themself to their passions and give importance not just to their role as mothers but also to their role in the workplace as leaders.\nIn conclusion, I believe the social change that characterised the last decades produced positive changes that permitted us to obtain a new understanding of the conception of family and love and to evaluate the role of women in the house and outside as free and independent workers.",

    "essay": "Recently, there have been significant changes in the family structure and family roles. This essay will illuminate some of these changes and analyse whether such changes are beneficial or detrimental.\nOne of the most prominent changes in this regard refers to the tendency of couples having fewer children or even no children, which may be attributed to adults' increasing workload and ensuing inability to look after children properly. Given their hectic schedules and rational concerns about their limited time and patience in taking care of adolescents, many couples would rather have fewer children. Another change is the growing trend of females joining the workforce, as necessitated by increasing living expenses, such as utility bills and property prices. To afford such costs and reach expected living standards, females have to give up being family women and apply for jobs. The other factor driving women to take jobs is the popularity of feminism upholding that women should be equal to men in all aspects, including employment.\nAs far as I am concerned, these changes derive from people's practical and merticulous considerations in the face of huge challenges, namely, the lack of time to take care of minors and soaring living costs. To tackles these obstacles, it is necessary for people to make such changes. Therefore, I vehemently support these changes.\nTo sum up, the modern society is witnessing great changes in the family structure and family roles, as exemplified by the smaller family size and larger number of females taking jobs. Personally, I think these are positive changes.",

    "essay": "It is argued by many people that history contains the lessons to help us understand human's life while others believe that we can hardly learn anything from the past. It is my opinion that history is a precious source of information that we inherent from the older generations and history is important for our future. This essay will discuss both views and give reasons to support my points.\nSome people think that the history is not important for us to grow and develop in our current life. I personally think that this is not true because our development in society today is the outcomes of learning from our mistakes in history. In addition, the history of our country or our region will help to enhance knowledge about our culture, beliefs or religions. These values are generational heritages and it is impossible for the new generation to obtain the cultural values without learning about history.\nIt is widely agreed that history is a valuable source of knowledge that enables human development and prosperity. The records of events and experiences of the older generations will be helpful for us in building our society for future generations. For example, in order to build the current social welfare system in America, the government has to look at the failures of other countries in the history and considers which approaches will be appropriate for their people. In addition, learning about history can broaden our understandings about human philosophy, human interations and conflicts. These knowledge are significantly important for our development intellectually and spiritually.\nIn summary, we can learn a lot from history and history is important for human development.",

    "essay": "It is true that these days people say there is little we can gain from previous history, whereas others think that history is a key source to understand our lives. Although there are some strong arguments against learning history, I agree with learning history to know life of human.\nThere are two reasons why people think there is nothing to gain from history. Firstly, there is evidence to support the idea that learning history stresses people out. Based on a survey conducted by Standford University, 57 percent of people consider learning past life of humans a primary source of stress, while less than 6 percent of people said studying previous humans' life was not a stressor. Secondly, people may not have time to remember historical events because the constant stimulation and hustle and bustle of society is holding them back from their life. In turn, they are more likely to regard learning history as useless.\nDespite the negative drawbacks, I support that historical event is great information to comprehend human's life. The main benefit of a historical event is that it can have a positive impact on people, especially children, as they grow up. Since history has more connection and support to our lives, it allows children to become more insightful and knowledgeable and discover advanced perspectives. For example, I have been widening my perspective through historical events in my family or country because gaining history regarding my family and nation taught me the right attitude to understand today. However, if I did not know any history, I would not have had an opportunity to understand human life and self-development. So, learning history should be encouraged.\nIn conclusion, while I recognize the possible disadvantages of learning history, I believe that the benefits of gaining past events far outweigh them in the long term.",

    "essay": "There are two contrasting views concerning the role of out past for our life today. According to the former there is nothing we can learn for our history. Instead, the latter sustains that the past a vital source for the understaing of our present life. I believe that in virtue of the action made in the history we must learn what is better and what is dangerous for human's life. History is then our method to evaluate whether the choices we make at the present time are right or wrong.\nI believe that history can teach us more than we can imagine. The past teached us how much pain humans being tolerate because of the wars. To understand the reasons and the causes of the conflicts between the countries it is the best way to proceed through a more pacific and civil relationship among the States. To make the idea clearer I want to propose the following analogy as example: as the awarness of our past actions (in other words, the actions we have done when we were children) taught that the fire burns and that we should pay attention when we get closer to it, we then can understand how much pain a war can take with it by reflecting on the pains that aflicted our ancestors because of the Second World War.\nOn the other hand, there are people supporting the thesis according to which history cannot teach anything to us. They start from the idea that our life today is completely different, techonological and then very far from what our ancestors lived. The world in which we live seems to them as another world with respect to that in which their grandparents lived. Hence, history results to be as a novel that cannot be used to make easier the human's progress. Thus the errors made by our grandfathers cannot be analysed with the contemporary eyes, they maybe could not be understood totally. Then the past's mistakes are not an alarm to remind us what we did and what we should try to escape from. Rather, they are nothing, just memories. According to this way of thinking, the world seems to be divided in temporal blocks each of which has no links with the others. History is reduced to an intricate novel.\nIn conclusion, I believe that history should be conceived as the first evaluation step of our present actions. By grasping the power that should come from a real understaing of our past, it is possible to analyse critically the present world order.",

There are certain aspect about being wealthy in which it could give oppurtunity to others and aid them through their toughest times.\nAccording to my point of view, being wealthy could be very beneficial to others who may not achieve the same oppurtunity as the ones with all the wealth. But according to my knowledge about this argument, being rich gives other individuals the oppurtunity to help.

    "essay": "The world today is often divided into two categories, more developed and less developed countries. This division is significant in terms of health, wealth and education. To minimise this gap, it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy. I, personally, feel that the prosperous countries are obligated and expected to to contribute to the development of countries with weaker economies.To address this argument, the history of the wealthy countries is relevant. Many less developed countries are former colonies, therefore the wealthy countries had a historical impact on the less wealthy. Thus, richer countriesÃ¢ÂÂ economies were dependent on the currently less developed countries for their rich status. Furthermore, even today the wealthy countries contribute to the wealth inequality by exploiting the inhabitants of less developed countries, giving workers lower wages than people within their own countries. Due to this dependence on poorer countries and the influence that the richer countries have had on the imbalance, it can be concluded that richer countries are indeed morally obliged to help the less wealthy countries.Opposing this is the view that each country is in charge of their own inhabitants and that therefore they need to provide health, education and basic necessities for themselves. In addition, simply providing these three services would not lead to closing the wealth gap. It would rather be helpful to invest sustainably in poorer countries and help them create their own systems, allowing these countries to be self-sufficient.In conclusion, while there is a moral necessity for wealthy countries to aid the poorer ones, simply providing basic necessities is not sufficient. A more sustainable idea would be to teach countries to plan and provide for themselves by giving economic incentives.",

    "essay": "The debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side. There are persuasive arguments for both points of view.One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Usually, a tenant only has to give a monthÃ¢ÂÂs notice before changing where he or she lives. If a property is owned and a change is needed, the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed. Sometimes, the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible. Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a familyÃ¢ÂÂs capital is not tied up in the property. Property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more. If one rents, this money can be spent on other things to help improve the familyÃ¢ÂÂs quality of life. If the property is on a mortgage, then the deposit, also often very large, is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress.Owning a property does have various advantages, though. Even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments, this money is then built up with the property. With renting, the money is lost to the landlord, but at the end of the term of the mortgage, the whole property is owned by the family. This makes the process of living in a property a type of investment. In addition, the propertyÃ¢ÂÂs value often goes up after time, frequently creating a substantial profit. Owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well-being and self-actualisation.The decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference. My opinion is that it is much more preferable to own a property, mainly because it creates a valuable asset for the family.",

    "essay": "It is certainly true that many people around the world find their lives dominated by the work that they have to do. This is shown when you realise how peopleÃ¢ÂÂs work, and how much time, effort and resources they devote to it, is often the subject of conversation.Most people depend on their jobs to generate an income to pay for their livesÃ¢ÂÂ necessities and luxuries, and so work can naturally become a dominating focus. As this is an important part of nearly everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs everyday life, it can seem that peopleÃ¢ÂÂs lives are indeed becoming more influenced by their jobs. Whether this emphasis on work is more significant now than in previous years is debatable. In many developed countries around the world, there are procedures in place to help people with finding work, providing unemployment benefits, ensuring education, and offering pension payments. In times past, these provisions were not in place and a job or business was required to provide the necessary income.Therefore, in spite of increases in the cost of living in many places around the world, it can be argued there is actually less pressure than in previous years to keep oneÃ¢ÂÂs job and perform well at it. This, in turn, would lead to peopleÃ¢ÂÂs lives being less influenced by their jobs today. It is also true that in the past, people were as responsible and focused on doing well in their responsibilities as today and so, in this respect, the people of the past would be equally dedicated to their work as people are today.While I agree that peopleÃ¢ÂÂs lives today are often dominated by their jobs, I feel that the current situation is not necessarily worse than before. In fact, it may be more positive, due to the fewer pressures to earn money in many countries.",

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",
    "essay": "Traditionally in many parts of the world, it has been women who have stayed at home to care for children. This has led to the ideology and expectation that women are more suited to this type of work than men.The overwhelming status quo where women stay at home to care for the children probably derives from the fact that women are the ones who have to actually give birth to children and, following that, they are the ones who for the early part of a childÃ¢ÂÂs life have to feed the child until it is weaned. In times past, this state of affairs probably led to the women assuming the permanent role of carer for the home and children, whilst men went out to work, whether it was to gather food or work in fields or factories.In spite of the fact that this became what was expected in family dynamics, it does not mean that men are necessarily less suited to caring for a child than women. It is very possible for men to care for a child, even from birth onwards in todayÃ¢ÂÂs world. BabiesÃ¢ÂÂ milk formula can be mixed by anyone and fed to a child. The fact that many women today choose not to do this again does not mean that they are better suited by nature to care for the child.Suitability for childcare is a matter for individual temperament and aptitude. Not many people, whether they are men or women, feel totally confident and knowledgeable about how to care for a baby or young child at the start. They need advice from their own mothers and fathers, midwives or from books. It is only from experience that skill with childcare comes and this skill can be acquired regardless of gender.All in all, I do not agree with the statement that men are less suited to childcare than women. I believe that aptitude to look after children is a matter of individual temperament, not gender-specific inherited qualities.",

    "essay": "High-rise apartment blocks are a common sight in cities around the world. They are especially popular in large cities and in locations where building land is scarce. Living in such buildings has various advantages and disadvantages for town planners and the inhabitants themselves.The most significant advantage of high-rise apartment blocks is probably for the town planners. With land often being at a premium in large cities, one way to maximise space is to build upwards, so that the population density per square kilometre can be increased. The demand for housing in big cities can therefore be more easily met. There are also disadvantages for town planners. The heavier population density can put added pressure on social facilities, for example sewage and other waste disposal, and the provision of adequate school and medical services.There are also advantages and disadvantages for the actual inhabitants of high-rise apartment blocks. With the demand for housing being reduced, prices are therefore not as high, making housing more affordable. Many people also like not having to be responsible for a garden, and living in an apartment has this advantage. Finally, with so many people living in the same area, many friendships can be made and a community spirit can be built up. It appears the most significant disadvantage is that, in practice, living in high-rise apartment blocks is just not the lifestyle many people want. In some city neighbourhoods, these living spaces can often be associated with poor living conditions and undesirable social elements. In addition, many people view high-rise apartment blocks as being unsafe. For example, in the case of fire, tall buildings are difficult or impossible to evacuate safely.It is clear that high-rise apartment blocks have benefits and drawbacks. It is also clear, however, that due to the need to house increasing numbers of people in cities, these architectural features are here to stay, whether people like them or not.",

    "essay": "The fashion industry today is an important component of society and peopleÃ¢ÂÂs lives. It is true that many people care little for clothes and scorn the importance that others attach to them; however, this does not mean that the significance that people give to fashion is a waste of time and money.When one considers that areas of the world suffer from poverty, disease and inadequate access to food and clean water, the emphasis attached to fashion by the developed world can seem out of proportion. Many people would contend that the resources put into developing and creating fashion would be more ethically spent on creating some level of equality in terms of the right to live a healthy and happy life. This point is hard to argue with. However, it is also true that people in the developed world cannot be expected to send all their spending money to people in need and that wanting to look good is an unalterable human trait.The fashion industry contributes to the society much like most other industries. It provides jobs and income to millions of people around the world and the money that changes hands generates taxes that contribute to the fabric of society. There is more to fashion than trying to look better than others and excessive luxury. The high level of fashion is indeed a kind of art form and, like other art forms, there will always be people who appreciate it, want to create it and want to spend money on it. It is part of the development of civilisation and this is not likely to change.I therefore feel that, although the gap between the rich and the poor sometimes makes it seem that fashion is a waste of time and money and an unethical use of resources, fashion is an important part of todayÃ¢ÂÂs society and economic output. This leads me to believe that trying to strike a balance between selfish greed and a more altruistic way of living should be an individual choice.",

    "essay": "There are many ways to learn new knowledge and skills. Traditional educational routes, such as school followed by college or university is one route that is generally accepted and respected by todayÃ¢ÂÂs society. It can be argued, however, that this is not always the best way. A more vocational route can be more appropriate for certain people and for particular jobs.Universities generally have deference given to them and, due to this, most schools tailor their programs to help students get university admission. Universities usually have respected and highly qualified teachers who have the knowledge and the skills to take their students to very high levels of knowledge and expertise. The very difficulty of gaining admission, getting through the duration of the course and passing final exams ensures to employers that graduates have the necessary self-discipline, intelligence and ability to get through the courses.Universities are also particularly well suited to the teaching of various subjects, for example, medicine, law and literature and these subjects need studentsÃ¢ÂÂ full-time attention in order to do well. Although vocational experience is necessary, a certain grounding in basic concepts to a high-level is important. Once this knowledge has been acquired, students can then integrate their knowledge with practical understanding.This, however, is not the case for all areas of learning, especially ones where the quantity of high level knowledge is not required or is possible to be learned whilst working at the same time. Young people studying to be an electrician or a plumber are good examples. To do this work well requires a lot of experience, yet also a sound understanding of theory. The learning here can be and is done working and studying at the same time, often through apprenticeships and vocational courses involving significant amounts of work experience.Therefore, in my opinion, there are more ways than one to acquire a profession. Whether learning should take place at university alone or whilst working depends on the course and the end job.",

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",
    "essay": "TodayÃ¢ÂÂs society overwhelmingly depends on products made from fossil fuels. Most people would initially think about fuel for transport, but of course, fossil fuels are part of most of the fabric of life around us, from the plastics on our furniture to the pavements that we walk on. Changing our reliance on these resources can have various consequences; however, I believe that overall the society will benefit from finding viable alternatives for them.Depending on whether eco-friendly alternatives are developed, the positive effect on transport and the reduction of the associated pollution will be significant. Exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, planes and ships decrease air quality and contribute to global warming and the greenhouse effect. PeopleÃ¢ÂÂs health and the health of the planet will surely improve without these industries relying on fossil fuels. It could be that a type of transport crisis could develop as a result if society can no longer provide the power to transport so many individuals to where they want to go. This, however, does not have to be a bad thing, as it could force society to use alternative solutions, such as transport sharing and public transport development. The change in mind set has already begun. Some countries have already committed to having fossil fuel free transport and more cities are banning private vehicles from the centre of cities.Another positive development would be that more time and money would have to be put into developing renewable sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and tidal power. Technologies would improve and be more efficient and again, the world would use fewer sources of energy that cause pollution. This development can also be seen today, with many governments committing to proportions of their power needs coming from renewable resources.I, therefore, strongly agree with the statement that the changes from reducing reliance on fossil fuels will be positive. The only caveat is that society will need to have developed alternative sources of power rather soon, in order to avoid an energy crisis.",

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",
    "essay": "With ever increasing technological advances, computers and robots are replacing human roles in different areas of society. This trend can also be seen in education, where interactive programs can enhance the educational experience for children and young adults. Whether, however, this revolution can also take over the role of the teacher completely is debatable, and I oppose this idea as it is unlikely to serve students well.The roles of computers and robots can be seen in many areas of the workplace. Classic examples are car factories, where a lot of the repetitive precision jobs done on assembly lines have been performed by robots for many years, and medicine, where diagnosis, and treatment, including operations, have also been assisted by computers for a long time. According to the media, it wonÃ¢ÂÂt also be long until we have cars that are driven automatically.It has long been discussed whether robots and computers can do this in education. It is well known that the complexity of programs can now adapt to so many situations that something can already be set up that has the required knowledge of the teacher, along with the ability to predict and answer all questions that might be asked by students. In fact, due to the nature of computers, the knowledge levels can far exceed a teacherÃ¢ÂÂs and have more breadth, as a computer can have equal knowledge in all the subjects that are taught in school, as opposed to a single teacherÃ¢ÂÂs specialisation. It seems very likely, therefore, that computers and robots should be able to deliver the lessons that teachers can, including various ways of differentiating and presenting materials to suit varying abilities and ages of students.Where I am not convinced is in the pastoral role of teachers. Part of teaching is managing behaviour and showing empathy with students, so that they feel cared for and important. Even if a robot or computer can be programmed to imitate these actions, students will likely respond in a different way when they know an interaction is part of an algorithm rather than based on human emotion.Therefore, although I feel that computers should be able to perform a lot of the roles of teachers in the future, they should be used as educational tools to assist teachers and not to replace them. In this way, students would receive the benefits of both ways of instruction.",

    "essay": "If one wants to work for money, there are really only two options, working for someone else for a salary and being self-employed. Most people are involved with these two options and they both have advantages and disadvantages.Being self-employed means that the worker owns the business that is being done. This might be a small one-person business or a large company with hundreds of employees. The first advantage of this is the capacity to earn more money. If the business does very well, the income can be considerable and the owner of the company will receive the benefits. On the other hand, if business is not good, the ownerÃ¢ÂÂs income will be low. Self-employed people also have the benefit to some extent of choosing their working hours and holidays and they have the right to change anything within their business. With this autonomy, however, comes the pressure to succeed and the reliance on oneÃ¢ÂÂs employees, if there are any, to do their best to make the business thrive.Salaried workers do not experience the same stress as the self-employed owners of companies. They might have stress in their duties, but the pressure that comes with keeping oneÃ¢ÂÂs own business operating successfully in order to support oneself and oneÃ¢ÂÂs family is just not felt by an employee. The employee also has a certain knowledge of his or her income, as the salary is usually fixed every month. The self-employed ownerÃ¢ÂÂs income often depends on how successful the business is. The employeeÃ¢ÂÂs fixed income, however, does not give much scope for earning large amounts more. In addition, an employee does not have the freedoms of the owner or the autonomy, and for many people, having control over their lives is a significant factor to their well-being.It is certain that there are advantages and disadvantages for both being self-employed and salaried. I personally disagree that being salaried is better than being self-employed. I prefer the autonomy that being self-employed brings and, although there is more risk and pressure, this can lead to greater and more fulfilling rewards.",

    "essay": "Throughout the history of education, learning a foreign language or languages has been a constant component. Of course, many people feel that this is really an unnecessary part of education for everyone, but this is not a point of view that I share.The opponents to learning a foreign language might argue that most people do not travel that often outside their own country. In addition to this, out of all the countries of the world, comparatively not many share the same language. Therefore, learning a foreign language will only be useful for the very limited time that one spends in a country where this language is used. For some people, the language might never be used in their entire lives. When one thinks about how much time and money are spent training language teachers, buying resources, going on trips and delivering lessons for such a negligible benefit, this would seem to be a very inefficient allocation of resources.However, the benefits of learning a foreign language go further than just the ability to use it from time to time on a holiday or business trip. Firstly, through learning one language, one gains an understanding to some extent of how all languages work. Thus, no matter where people might end up around the world, the knowledge of language can be of use. Secondly, with the study of a foreign language, one also opens oneself up to other cultures. This allows in turn an appreciation for different points of view and belief systems. With an ever-shrinking world due to globalisation, the ability to empathise and understand the people from other countries is vital to reducing conflict and creating a more tolerant society. Finally, quite simply learning languages is excellent for the improvement of general cognitive skills.It seems to me that learning a foreign language, therefore, is more than just gaining the ability to speak a few words of a foreign tongue. It is part of intellectual and social development and needs to be continued for everyone in todayÃ¢ÂÂs schools.",

    "essay": "It is indeed true that digital resources today far outstrip what can be put and stored in print books. Almost any kind of book can now be accessed digitally and those that canÃ¢ÂÂt be will soon be changed to a digital format. Some people, therefore, believe that libraries with print books are no longer needed.If one looks at this issue dispassionately, it seems far more logical that people now should only read books digitally. It only requires a single computer or electronic reader and an individual can have access to the history of literature and works on all other fields. The costs involved with setting, typing, printing and distributing print books would practically disappear and this would make things more convenient and much cheaper. An actual library building would be totally unnecessary, as all one would need would be a Ã¢ÂÂvirtual libraryÃ¢ÂÂ as a website and all works could be accessed through this portal. There would not even be any need to leave the house to gain access to anything one needed. This would seem to be the most logical way of proceeding.Logic, however, is not always the best approach to everything. Print books have a long history with humanity and our relationship with real books is not something that can be changed overnight. Many people, including younger readers, feel that there is something special about having a book with real paper and needing to turn pages. There will therefore for the time being be a future for print books and libraries.Libraries will continue to be especially important, as not all older people use computers and e-readers as much as the younger generation. They will still want to read print books and the library is a cheap and convenient place to find them. In addition, if only a few books in print are available in the future, libraries might be one of the few places where they might be accessed. Another purpose that libraries serve is acting as community centres that organise events, education and childcare. Ironically, libraries also provide computers and Internet access for people who cannot afford their own.In spite of the seeming dominance to come of digital books, I feel that there is and will be a place for libraries with print books. This state of affairs might change in the future, but at present, they are important community resources.",

    "essay": "The responsibility for providing funds for retirement is incredibly important and something that is often overlooked by younger people. Some believe it is the responsibility of the individual to plan for this, but others feel it is the responsibility of the state.People who believe that the state should be responsible for funding retirees, base their argument on the fact that in most countries, people pay taxes and social charges to the government. This money, they argue, should also go towards the provision of a pension for the person paying the tax. In addition, those who have very small or no income, pay little or no tax and do not have the ability to provide for themselves. The government, therefore, in its role of caring for the population, has an obligation to pay a pension and provide other social benefits, such as medical treatment.Many others, however, feel that it is the responsibility of individuals to fund their own retirements. As adults, they argue, people should be able to set aside and invest money throughout their lifetime, so that they can retire with few financial worries. In many countries the government has legislated a framework allowing and encouraging citizens to save up and accumulate sufficient funds for the period after their working years have ended.I neither agree nor disagree with the statement, but rather my opinion takes in parts of both arguments. I feel that people should be responsible for saving money to fund their retirement, but I also feel that individuals who have not had the chance to do so should be supported by the government out of taxes. In my view, therefore, it is wrong to say that governments have no obligation to help people in this area. Governments are there to support the entire population of their countries, which includes the poorer elements of society.",

    "essay": "Banning cars from the centre of various cities around the world has been a strategy to reduce pollution and encourage people to use public transport. It has had various positive effects for both individuals and for society as a whole.Banning cars from the centre of cities seems to be a very positive development. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution and fewer fossil fuel resources being used up. Although the effect on resources might be relatively negligible, it can create a newer way of thinking regarding the dynamics of transport within cities and this could be the most important benefit to society. Some people working in the centre of these cities may complain about inconvenience, but many would agree that this is a small price to pay.A reduction in the reliance of people on private vehicles is likely to encourage them to use public transport or even bicycles. Using public transport, especially the types that run on clean sources of power, will significantly raise air quality levels in cities, which will of course benefit everyone. The clean air could even further encourage the use of bicycles, which would in turn promote more healthy lifestyles and less obesity. This would contribute on an individual level to peopleÃ¢ÂÂs well-being and a better and longer life, and on a societal level, it would lessen the strain on public health resources. Governments could encourage this by creating more bicycle lanes to make cycling easier and safer.In conclusion, it is clear that banning cars from the centre of cities is significantly beneficial.

Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",
    "essay": "It has been a popular trend for some time now to put children into what can be called Ã¢ÂÂwork experience placementsÃ¢ÂÂ. The children are taken out of school and take part in various types of work, usually for around a week. Some people criticise this trend, but I canÃ¢ÂÂt see how it can be a negative experience.One of the criticisms is that children lose a week of schoolwork. With the pressure to do well at school increasing, children need every bit of help to maximise their potential. Taking them out of the school, it is therefore argued, stops them from getting access to needed education for a whole week. As the students wonÃ¢ÂÂt really be of much help to a workplace for just one week, it would therefore be better for them to remain at school.While this is a valid point, taking a childÃ¢ÂÂs entire experience of school into account, a single week away does not make a significant difference. Indeed, if the timing of the weekÃ¢ÂÂs work placements is done correctly, the week can also serve as a kind of Ã¢ÂÂholidayÃ¢ÂÂ away from school, something that is regularly needed in order to allow students to remain fresh and enthusiastic. In many work placements, children also get to see some of things they learn at school put into a realistic context, allowing them to understand the relevance of what they learn and thereby creating a way to reinforce the learning.In addition to this, schoolchildren can be quite nervous about the world of work that they will have to join at some point in their lives. By getting this short taste of what it is like, they can see that it is nothing to be scared about. As well as this, children will often have some ideas of what they want to do for a living, but are not sure. By allowing them to see a type of work they are considering, they are better able to decide whether that career could be suitable for them.I feel, therefore, that work placements can be seen as a positive development. Missing a short amount of school is not serious and the benefits that can be gained from the placements are significant.",

    "essay": "It indeed appears true that the frequency with which advertisements for charities appear both on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. There can be various explanations for this and it can be seen in both a positive and negative light.One explanation for the increase in the number of charity advertisements is that the charities themselves are becoming more aggressive in their marketing. This can also be seen in the common strategy nowadays to encourage a monthly donation, rather than a one-off donation. The increased marketing is apparent too in the increased numbers of Ã¢ÂÂstreet salespeopleÃ¢ÂÂ, who stop passersby and try to get them to commit to this monthly payment.A second reason for the increase could also be that there have been more charities started and the number of advertisements would therefore increase and become more noticeable. If these charities are all legitimate, this would mean that more help will be getting to causes that need it. The increase in charities could also be explained by a possible increase of humanitarian awareness. People might be now adopting different ideologies that take into account people in less advantageous positions.If the number of advertisements for charities has risen due to the fact that there has been a positive shift in peopleÃ¢ÂÂs compassionate principles, this surely has to be seen as an optimistic development. If it is due to the fact that governments have been cutting back, it could be seen as a pessimistic development. In addition, if there are more charities asking for more money, this will inevitably mean that the amount of money donated will have to be more thinly spread, which would be a negative development.There could be several reasons for why there are more charity advertisements today. Whatever the reasons, as long as any money is helping people in disadvantageous positions, it must be seen as a positive development.",

When such person comes out of prison, it is very often the case that they have the same few opportunities for a legitimate income. In fact, these opportunities will even be reduced, as employers are often less willing to give an ex-prisoner a job. Some people also return to crime, as they spend all the time of their prison sentence with other criminals. This is not a great environment for rehabilitation, and sometimes even a network of contacts can be made to help develop criminal activities on release.One important way to help address this problem is education. Criminals who have turned to illegal activities because of no alternatives to earn a living need to learn a way to earn a wage, such as a trade or vocational skills. Computer skills, for example, are in high demand and someone trained in these could very possibly find work. In addition, governments can offer incentives to employers to attract them to give jobs to newly-released prisoners. This would help people who donÃ¢ÂÂt really want to return to crime achieve a fresh start. As keeping people in prison is an expensive business, governments might find it cheaper to pay these incentives.To sum up, people returning to crime is a tragedy that should be avoided if at all possible in todayÃ¢ÂÂs society. Education and incentives can directly address the reasons for it and could make society a happier and safer place.",

    "essay": "Social media today is extremely significant to a majority of the population, especially the younger generation. Many teenagers find it exceptionally convenient and necessary for communication and entertainment. However, not everyone is able to use social media responsibly, which gave rise to the idea of making it accessible to only those older than eighteen years of age.Though there are negatives, such as cyber-bullying, or being too distracted by these modern media, there are issues surrounding most things in life. It is a choice to go onto a social media website, and many younger people are capable of managing accounts without any difficulties. It is not the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs responsibility to monitor under eighteen-year olds; that is for the parents.Statistics show that over eighty per cent of teens use a form of online social media. It allows them to chat online, easily stay in contact with friends and family across the world, and see updates on othersÃ¢ÂÂ lives (through text, photos or videos). Social media is a way to express thoughts or ideas and to stay in contact with the rest of the world.To not permit one of the largest Internet-using demographics to use social media because a few people have problems with it is an irrational and an unfair restriction. Not only would profit be lost with fewer users, but controlling who creates accounts and monitoring proof of age would be difficult as well. I believe that laws should not make social media inaccessible to young people under eighteen; this would be unnecessary and absurd.",

    "essay": "In many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together. There is a group of countries, however, that educate boys and girls separately. This is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always. Having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages.One of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that, if they are together, they can distract each other. After puberty, boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa, and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as, for example, they show off to one another. Separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour. However, some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work, and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class, and sometimes more so. These teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour.Many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs. Separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily. There is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened.A major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis. This can lead to shyness and, more seriously, dysfunctional relationships later in life. Some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them.In conclusion, I feel that children should be educated all together, although I would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs. My personal opinion is that different genders should learn to interact together from an early age, as this would allow them to develop healthy working relationships with each other.",

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.",
    "essay": "Homelessness and poverty is a terrible but topical issue in both more economically advanced and less industrialised countries. To deal with this, many people feel that a small proportion of everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs income should be used to aid the homeless and poor. This could create more opportunities and change the lives of many disadvantaged people for the better.Though there are certain facilities such as shelters and soup kitchens to aid the poor and homeless, it is clear that this is not enough. In the U.S. alone, a very developed country in itself, nearly two million people are homeless. These facilities can lend a helpful hand; however, they do not help eradicate the problem. Those people who are homeless or poor can have trouble finding jobs, or, if they are lucky to gain employment, the pay may not be enough to support them and their families.If a small percentage of everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs income was used to help build more aid facilities and fund organisations to help the homeless and poor, the suffering of many people could be alleviated. However, this is not a perfect world, and taxes are high enough for many people. A similar argument could be that a portion of the taxes already paid to the government should then be set aside for this cause, but of course government funds are usually stretched to breaking point as it is, as governments have so many financial responsibilities already.Though the fundamental idea that people should pay a small percentage of their income to help the homeless and poor is admirable, it is unlikely that enough people would agree to it. People need all the money they earn after taxes anyway and, although governments already have too many calls on their available funds, in my view they should prioritise support payments for the homeless.",

    "essay": "The amount of waste people produce can be quite shocking, with every person generating kilograms of rubbish in a single day, and all this can be difficult to manage. This has given some people the idea that there should be a limitation on the amount of rubbish produced per household; however, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the the most effective option.Having a limitation on the amount of waste produced sounds like a fine solution to a significant problem, with over two hundred and fifty million tons being generated in 2016 by the U.S. alone. Taxing households that break limits would push people to produce less waste and make them more mindful of what can be recycled or composted. However, forcing people to produce less waste might not be attainable.Households produce as much waste as they need to live their lifestyles. The waste people generate is only a result of the products they purchase, and will most likely wish to continue to purchase. Taxing people may be a cause of resentment, with many of them already struggling to pay their usual bills. In addition, if people produce more than they are allowed, this will encourage littering and dumping, so that they are not caught with more waste than entitled, and this in turn will damage the environment.Though controlling the amount of waste produced is important, there could be other ways of encouraging lesser output. In my opinion, governments should encourage composting and recycling, which will also reduce wasted material. People should also be more aware of what waste they produce and how it can be reduced. An education drive on these issues would perhaps be more likely to succeed in reducing rubbish than imposing limitations.",

    "essay": "It is no secret that todayÃ¢ÂÂs entertainment industry is extremely popular, with nearly everyone being engaged at some time in watching TV shows, movies and sports games. The North American sports industry alone generates a massive $67.7 billion every year. With the present emphasis on entertainment, sportsmen and women and professional entertainers can earn enormous salaries, with figures in the millions for one game, appearance or film. This situation certainly does reflect todayÃ¢ÂÂs societyÃ¢ÂÂs obsession with entertainment.Many people argue that celebrities do not deserve such payment when work in other professions considered of equal or higher value to society is underpaid. A-list celebrities can make over $20 million per movie, whilst many average workers can barely make ends meet. Of course there are lots of people who say that there are better ways the money could be used, rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person. This is a fairly naive point of view, though. So long as people wish to watch entertainment, advertising in turn will be present and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries, as their presence will ensure the high viewing figures the advertisers desire.Though celebrities and sportsmen and sportswomen often make very large sums of money, it can also be seen as unfair to say that they do not deserve it or propose their money be used for something else. While it is true that they did not find a cure for cancer or made a life-changing scientific discovery, their hard work and expertise created a product that the public wants to see and the high payment merely reflects their value.In conclusion, it is clear that todayÃ¢ÂÂs society is indeed a society obsessed with being entertained and the high salaries paid to those who entertain society clearly reflect this. The high payments, however, are not necessarily out of place or undeserved.",

    "essay": "Punishing children with physical force, or corporal punishment as it is also called, is something that was accepted not so long ago and people over the age of forty may well remember it. Nowadays, however, corporal punishment is against the law in most countries and adults who practise it can be taken to court. Children are always a vulnerable group and they depend on adults for protection and education. Of course, part of the growing up process is testing and breaking boundaries and it is nearly always necessary to instill discipline on a child. Whether or not it is necessary to use physical force to do so can be a very emotive subject.Supporters of corporal punishment often defend their standpoint by explaining that the corporal punishment is not, or should not be, excessive. They do not argue that a child should be beaten severely until he or she is bruised or cut. They argue that just the infliction of mild pain causes effective discipline and also the fear that it might be applied. People who grew up experiencing it might offer this point of view.Those who oppose using physical force on a child would say that the vulnerability and innocence of a child means that force should never be used. Children need to trust adults and believe that no harm will come to them. Additionally, children learn from adults and it is argued that corporal punishment will only teach children that force is an answer to various problems. It is also claimed that corporal punishment has no added benefits over other forms of discipline that do not require physical force. Using it can cause psychological harm to children and should be classed as child abuse.Personally, I do not believe that limited use of forms of corporal punishment can cause harm, and a parent who administers a mild form of it to his or her child should not be subject to criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, I would not use it myself. I can also recognise the possibilities of adults who are not a childÃ¢ÂÂs parents misusing corporal punishment. Therefore, I believe that on balance physical force to discipline children should not be permitted.",

    "essay": "Travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from Europe to Singapore, crossing nearly the whole globe. Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary peopleÃ¢ÂÂs lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home.",

    "essay": "In modern day society, money is a driving force for nearly everyone. Most people aspire to be financially secure and to have the ability to live the life they want. However, not everyone is able to find paid employment, and for that reason in some countries around the world, governments have initiated a system where the unemployed receive a regular payment to enable them to survive. Some people believe it is an excellent idea, whilst others believe that it is exhausting a countryÃ¢ÂÂs financial resources.When looking at the positive aspects of this system, it can be said that it prevents individuals from having a private bankruptcy. When somebody becomes unemployed, he or she will have on-going costs such as rent for a dwelling, bills for water, telephone and electricity as well as the cost of food and several other things. Without a salary, this person will fall into debt, because they will be unable to cover these expenses. A national unemployment payment system will therefore prevent this person from losing nearly everything over time. Without such system, many people would become homeless and would potentially engage in criminal activities to survive. Therefore, one can say that this system is positive. Although stories are heard of people exploiting the system, usually the newly unemployed want to find a job fast in order to become financially independent again, meaning that the government does not have to support them for long.Although there are positive aspects of this system, one can also say that if the payment made by the government is too high, it will prevent people from looking for work actively. Occasionally, the payment people receive is higher than their potential salaries, deterring them from working and creating an on-going cost for the government. A potential solution for this could be providing free training and employment support to open up new career opportunities with higher income, which would motivate this group to re-enter the workforce.In conclusion, the unemployment benefits system has positive and negative aspects. Personally, I believe that the positive effects of the system outweigh the negative. The payment must remain on a level that helps people survive without regular salaries, but does not seem attractive to exploit over a longer period of time.",

    "essay": "In recent years, computer use around the world has increased drastically. As a result technological equipment is used increasingly in schools around the world. Many people question therefore whether schools should put much emphasis on teaching students basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills.The use of technological equipment in lessons has increased since the onset of the digital age. Nearly all professions around the world involve computer use and even the simplest tasks are carried out via electronic equipment. Hence, it is important for students to learn how to use technology correctly for their future careers. Electronic devices also offer various learning advantages, as notes and assignments can be completed much faster and more neatly using these tools.Nonetheless, the practical skills such as using and holding a pen correctly are likewise vital for future careers. For that reason, students have to be taught at early ages how to carry out simple tasks using basic skills, such as writing. It is also essential that a student develops neat handwriting, as in the case of a technological problem the student will have to write by hand. Furthermore, final exams are typically written by hand and thus the student must develop the basic skill of holding a pen and writing with it. Mathematics skills are no different. People will not always have a device with them to carry out calculations and the ability to do arithmetic in the head is a vital skill for operating in todayÃ¢ÂÂs world.In conclusion, I personally believe that schools should keep a balance between using practical skills and using electronic equipment to carry out certain tasks by having student submit assignments created electronically, yet also by having them complete assignments by hand in class and without computers or calculators. This balance is important, as if the focus lies only on one of the two aspects, the student will face problems later on in life.",

    "essay": "To perform well in a job, people have to be motivated. There are multiple strategies for employers to incentivise their employees. The most obvious one is the salary; however, job satisfaction and the ability to help people are other methods of improving performance at work.For the majority of the people, receiving their salary at the end of the month is their motivation. This is because money is necessary to fulfill the most basic needs and other materialistic desires. Employees see these opportunities when receiving their salary and therefore work to achieve money. Furthermore, performing well in a job can often lead to promotions with higher pay packages. To receive this, staff have to stand out positively in their jobs. Salary is therefore a key motivational tool for many workforce participants.However, money is far from being the only incentive. Another aspect affecting performance is job satisfaction. If a person is comfortable in their work, they are more likely to perform well. Therefore this motivational tool interlinks with salary, as when people are content and perform well, the chances of promotion increase. For some individuals though, only their passion can drive them. Prime examples for this are humanitarian jobs. The salaries are often not very high, but those choosing to work in this field are often very driven; their passion to help others is prioritised over their own salary.In conclusion, while income might be the most common motivational factor, it is unusual to be the sole incentive for working hard, and some people are motivated wholly due to other reasons.",

    "essay": "Public health has become an increasingly pressing issue in the modern world, with many populations facing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. This has led to a debate as to whether governments should establish nutrition and food choice laws for the betterment of public health or if it solely falls on individuals to make wise choices. In my view, everyone should take ownership of their diet and assume responsibility for their health because it is the right choice.The argument for government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws is that they could help prevent people from making unhealthy choices which could lead to more serious illnesses down the line. For example, government regulations could limit the amount of sugar or fats allowed in food products, especially those marketed to children, and impose taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy bars. This approach would also benefit those who lack the knowledge about healthy food, necessary to make informed decisions. By providing clear guidelines on what foods are healthy, and by taxing the unhealthy options higher, the government would steer individuals away from unhealthy options.However, there are also some valid arguments against governmental intervention. These types of regulations infringe upon individualsÃ¢ÂÂ right to choose what they put in their bodies. After all, everyone should be free to make lifestyle choices for themselves. Additionally, there may not be enough evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would have beneficial effects on public health outcomes in the long run. Since peopleÃ¢ÂÂs love of unhealthy food is often considered an addiction, it is unlikely that a higher price or other warnings would be enough to deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food items.In conclusion, while there can certainly be benefits associated with implementing nutrition and food choice laws at a governmental level, ultimately it should still come down to personal choice and responsibility as far as oneÃ¢ÂÂs diet is concerned. Governments should instead focus on providing citizens with better nutrition education, so that they can make better informed decisions about what they consume. This way, they can receive the information they need while still having autonomy over their own diets and lifestyles.",

    "essay": "An alarming number of people today consume sugar-based drinks, whether it is in the form of soda, energy drinks or fruit drinks. Often consumers are lured by their widespread availability and convenience, however, marketing campaigns also play a role, targeting young people and giving them the perception that sugary drinks are not as unhealthy as they actually are.The availability of these types of drinks has greatly increased over time. They can now be found in almost any store or restaurant, which makes them easily accessible to almost anyone. The fact that they are often cheaper than alternatives, such as water or freshly squeezed juice, makes them an especially attractive option for those on a budget. Marketing campaigns for sugary beverages have been quite successful in creating positive associations attached to these products through advertisements on TV and billboards. This encourages people to consider them fun rather than unhealthy and normalises them within society.Luckily, reversing the rise in popularity of sugary drinks is still possible, if we act now and attack the problem from different angles. One of the very first steps should be educating people on the health risks associated with high sugar intake so that they can make better-informed decisions when selecting what type of beverage they consume. Companies should also be held accountable by law for their misleading marketing campaigns aimed at children and teenagers who are more likely to believe the false claims about their productsÃ¢ÂÂ health benefits without fully understanding whatÃ¢ÂÂs being sold to them. Schools, colleges and universities, and any institutions catering for young people, should consider banning sugary drinks and replacing them with refreshing alternatives without added sugar.Overall, it is important that we recognise the potential health risks posed by consuming too much sugar from soft drinks and take actionable steps towards reversing this trend in order to ensure our long-term wellbeing. Through greater education, government regulation, and increased corporate responsibility we can ensure that more people understand why reducing their intake of sugary beverages is important while still allowing them to access enjoyable yet healthier options.",

    "essay": "It is not uncommon for teenagers to worship celebrities. From singers to actors, many young people around the world look up to these stars and attempt to emulate their lifestyles. In my opinion, allowing children to idolize celebrities can often be detrimental, as they frequently set a poor example.Many of todayÃ¢ÂÂs celebrities tend to lack moral values, and they promote behaviour inappropriate for young people. For instance, some music videos feature explicit lyrics glorifying drug use and violence. In addition, the media often reports on celebrities who indulge in excessive partying or drinking alcohol despite being underage. These types of headlines can have a negative influence on impressionable teens who might falsely believe that they should follow suit to appear cool or successful.Poor morals arenÃ¢ÂÂt the only issue, as many popular stars are also well-known for their irresponsible spending habits. They routinely splurge on luxury items such as designer clothing or expensive cars without any consideration for budgeting or saving money responsibly. This kind of behaviour is dangerous because it is normalizing materialism and teaching teens that costly possessions will bring them happiness instead of focusing on what really matters in life: meaningful relationships, knowledge, and hard work.To conclude, young adults should keep in mind that societyÃ¢ÂÂs perception of fame and fortune is based on temporary, insubstantial things rather than what actually matters. In the grand scheme of things, it would be far more beneficial for teenagers to spend time developing their own set of values rooted in quality education and strong family relationships.",

    "essay": "Many people strive to achieve a work-life balance, but often find themselves failing despite their best efforts. This is not surprising, as balancing work and life commitments can be extremely difficult due to both having their unique stressors.One of the major reasons why so many people struggle to achieve harmony between their personal and professional lives is that now it is easier than ever for people to stay connected outside of regular work hours. This has led to an expectation that employees should always be available, and they risk being seen as unreliable or uncommitted if they are not. A knock-on effect of longer working hours is that little time is left for leisure activities such as socialising or engaging in hobbies or sports, which help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being. This type of pressure and lack of free time can lead to feelings of burnout, with no respite from lifeÃ¢ÂÂs pressures, resulting in chronic fatigue and diminished motivation over time.Helping those struggling to find a suitable work-life balance will require joint efforts of managers and employees. Workers, for instance, need to recognise the importance of taking regular breaks throughout the day and getting enough sleep each night, while employers should consider being more flexible when it comes to allowing staff to work remotely and offering paid vacation days. This will give employees space, both mentally and physically, enabling them to better manage their commitments without overextending themselves.In conclusion, achieving a successful work-life balance is something that many cannot quite reach due to external pressures from employers and a lack of downtime. However, these issues can be overcome, if we create realistic boundaries between our professional lives and personal goals, and make conscious decisions about how we want to spend our time.",

    "essay": "In todayÃ¢ÂÂs ever-increasingly digital world, online communication has become the norm for many workplaces. While this development offers numerous advantages for companies such as greater flexibility and efficiency, it also brings with it certain disadvantages like miscommunication, which must be weighed against its benefits.One of the primary advantages of online communication is that it makes it easier for teams to stay in touch without having to physically convene. This is especially beneficial when individuals or groups are dispersed across vast distances. Reduced travel costs, as well as time saved from not having to travel to and from meetings, also represent meaningful savings for businesses. Additionally, online communication platforms often have a range of features designed to make collaboration more efficient, such as providing an easy way to share documents and other materials with remote team members. To illustrate, digital resources can be sent quickly and securely via email or other software services like Dropbox or Google Drive.There is a potential drawback associated with relying too heavily on online communication at work, as the lack of physical proximity between members of a team can often lead to misunderstandings due to a loss of context or nonverbal cues that would otherwise be present during face-to-face meetings. However, in my opinion, issues of this nature can be solved by using written language more carefully to avoid any confusion or miscommunication among colleagues.In conclusion, when online communication tools are used properly, they undoubtedly provide companies with greater flexibility in how their teams collaborate without sacrificing clarity of communication, quality or efficiency.",

    "essay": "The benefits of walking are numerous, and experts recommend it as a good way to keep healthy and fit. Despite this, the number of people who walk on a daily basis is on the decline. The reasons for this are manifold, but there are also several solutions that may help people walk more.Lack of time is the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity. These days most people have hectic schedules that involve juggling their work and home responsibilities. As a result, they are often too exhausted or pressed for time and therefore opt for faster and more comfortable forms of transport, such as cars, bikes or public transport. Another major reason for the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is a lack of safety. Most full-time workers are not free to walk during the day, and will skip it in the evenings or early morning hours, if they do not feel safe enough to do so.Fortunately, there are quite a few solutions to this issue. One is making walkers safe, which means the government should ensure that there are enough sidewalks and streetlights available in every suburb, so that pedestrians can walk or jog safely whenever time allows. Another useful option is to create special walking tracks and parks in neighbourhoods where people can get some much-needed exercise in the evenings. The added benefit of promoting the healthy lifestyle and walking in the community makes this solution even more attractive.To conclude, the pressures of daily life and lack of safely while walking reduce the popularity of this healthy practice. Governments can reverse this trend by creating more green spaces for people to walk in and addressing their safety concerns.",

    "prompt": "In many countries, a lot of food is wasted. Why do people waste food? How can we reduce the amount of food waste?",
    "essay": "Despite the fact that millions of people in the world go hungry every day, a surprisingly large amount of food gets wasted daily in certain parts of the world. In my opinion, the main reason for this is that people in the first-world countries tend to only buy food that is aesthetically pleasing, and fortunately, there are some ways to tackle this issue.It is shockingly sad to know that large amounts of perfectly edible food in the form of fresh produce get sent to landfills, and the main reason for this is that these foods do not meet the standards of perfection set for fruits and vegetables by consumers and grocery stores. For example, veggies and fruit that are misshapen or have a few spots on them are still good enough to eat, yet they are often left on shelves to rot in favour of something that looks less damaged. In addition, a lot of customers confuse the Ã¢ÂÂbest byÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂuse byÃ¢ÂÂ dates, thinking that foods that have passed their Ã¢ÂÂbest byÃ¢ÂÂ dates are no longer fit to eat. Another major reason for food wastage is that people often overestimate the amount of produce they require on a weekly or monthly basis, and most of it ends up getting thrown out instead of being used.There are many ways to reduce the amount of food being wasted, and I think one of the best ideas is to increase peopleÃ¢ÂÂs awareness of just how much good food is disposed of, only because of our superficial biases as to how food should look. Raising the awareness of the staggering number of people that go hungry in third-world countries would make it harder to throw away an apple just because it is a little bruised. Also, teaching people how to better plan their monthly food requirements would help them not to overspend on food that they do not need; it would be great for the environment and their budget. The role of the government in this endeavour is indispensable as such task would be too great for any smaller organisation.To conclude, the wasting food is a serious issue that merits increased awareness from both people and the leaders of the world. It is unacceptable to discard any food when there are so many people who are starving, and hopefully our joint effort can help improve the current situation.",

    "prompt": "Some people believe that the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the price of fuel.Do you agree or disagree?",
    "essay": "Raising the price of car fuel is believed by some people to be an excellent method to solve the growing number of environmental issues. However, I strongly disagree with this idea, as doing so would make life difficult for lower-income households. While making fuel more expensive wouldnÃ¢ÂÂt change the habits of wealthy families, switching to fossil fuel alternatives could prove to be much more beneficial for the environment.The most compelling reason against raising the cost of fuel is that the upper classes of society will hardly be affected by rising fuel costs, as this only makes up a minor proportion of their expenditure. They will continue to use their personal vehicles as they wish without a thought for the environment or the higher fuel prices, even if their country has state-of-the-art public transportation.Those who will feel the crunch of this decision are the middle-class and lower-income households, since travelling is a major part of most peopleÃ¢ÂÂs routine, be it to work, school or shopping. Driving is almost unavoidable in many instances; therefore, raising the price of petrol would only serve to widen the gap between the rich and poor, and serve as an inadvertent form of discrimination.Another reason why increasing the cost of fuel is far from the best way to deal with environmental pollution is that now there are much more viable alternatives. Due to the rapid advances in technology, scientists and engineers have been able to develop several alternatives to fossil fuel, such as cars powered by electricity or naturally produced biofuel. The move to adopt clean energy sources instead of fossil fuels is a much more promising alternative compared to simply making fuel more expensive.In conclusion, I believe that governments of the world should invest more time and money in finding alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally friendly, rather than simply raising the cost of petrol.",

    "prompt": "Discipline is a growing problem in modern schools. Some people think that parents should discipline their own children, while others think it should be the responsibility of the government. Discuss both views and give your opinion.",
    "essay": "While some people argue that parents should take sole responsibility for disciplining their children, others take the view that the government should be in charge of such matters. In my opinion, the young generation should be primarily guided by their parents where rules of behavior and moral principles are concerned. However, in some instances government intervention is necessary.On one side of the argument, there are people who hold the opinion that the responsibility of disciplining a child falls squarely on parentsÃ¢ÂÂ shoulders, since they are their first educators, and it is their duty to equip their children with good manners and morals even before their first day at school. In addition, every family has a unique understanding of what a suitable form of discipline entails. Therefore, some parents are concerned that any form of punishment meted out at school might be too harsh. To overcome this issue, they believe that parents should be informed by the school of their childÃ¢ÂÂs wrongdoing so that they could decide an appropriate consequence for their behavior at home.Unfortunately, not all parents are objective enough to make the right decisions when it comes to the upbringing of their children. Some may lack information or sound moral background to discipline their children in a meaningful way. Therefore, the state should shoulder some of the responsibility by implementing a strict set of guidelines and policies on how to discipline children at school. I believe that such policies result in children who flourish and are more likely to become productive citizens that actively contribute to a prosperous nation. Also, this would help both parents and teachers understand which punishments are suitable for minor infractions like missing an assignment or major incidents like bullying or skipping school.In conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that the government must be actively involved in the policies related to discipline at schools as this would ensure the well-being and successful development of the youth.",

    "prompt": "These days, many young people are not spending their weekends and holidays doing outdoor activities such as hiking or mountaineering. Why is that happening? How can they be encouraged to spend more time in the natural environment?",
    "essay": "Nowadays, the younger generation tends to avoid recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism. It seems that young people prefer to spend their weekends indoors, gaming or engaging in other online activities. If that is the case, by promoting sports more actively and organising sports competitions, the schools could counteract this trend.Living in the era of technology, the wide availability and variety of online entertainment are compelling young people to spend a lot of their free time indoors, using their gadgets. Numerous relatively cheap forms of amusement, such as online games, videos, audiobooks and plenty of other activities, tempt teenagers to stay at home and lead more sedentary lifestyles. A recent survey revealed that the vast majority of students would prefer spending their weekends playing computer games, rather than in the nature. That is one clear reason why our modern youth is less interested in recreational sports.To address this issue, the school management could intervene and offer a better range of outdoor sports activities and competitions, both within the school curriculum and as extra-curricular activities. For example, high schools could increase the number of weekly football, running and climbing classes, and organise competitions at the end of each term. As a result, pushed by their desire to win, students would do more walking, jogging, running and mountaineering during the school term, in preparation for the competition. This would reduce the time spent online, lessen the studentsÃ¢ÂÂ dependence on the Internet for entertainment, and eventually boost their desire to spend more time enjoying the natural environment.To sum up, screen addiction plays a major role in young peopleÃ¢ÂÂs avoidance of various outdoor activities. Opening up more recreational sports and offering frequent competitions on school grounds is a great way to motivate more students to spend their leisure time in the nature.",

    "essay": "International sporting events are well-known for attracting a high level of attention because they give many people something to look forward to. Understandably, there are advantages and disadvantages for the host country, and careful consideration is required to determine whether a nation will benefit or lose from hosting a major sports championship.Worryingly, the new infrastructure required for hosting a major sporting event often comes at the expense of local people. Their lives get disrupted by construction works and at times residents have even been evicted from their homes for stadiums to be built. Worse still, practice shows the expensive, gigantic buildings constructed for the sports event arenÃ¢ÂÂt being used afterwards and fall into disrepair, leaving the country with high maintenance bills. The financial burden from hosting the Olympic Games, for example, is staggering and can run into tens of billions. Still, the question remains whether or not the pros outnumber the cons.It is hard to underestimate the amount of influence on the countryÃ¢ÂÂs global status and prestige that comes with becoming a home to an international sporting event. New trade opportunities appear on the horizon, as it happened for many countries that hosted the Olympic Games. There is also a welcome increase in tourism, which gives the local economy a boost, injecting billions of dollars into the national budget. Construction of new stadiums, hotels and infrastructure such as new roads and rail links creates new jobs, further improving the countryÃ¢ÂÂs economy. Less tangible but still important is the aspect of national pride and the feel-good factor associated with hosting an international sports event.All in all, it seems to me that an international sporting event can bring more good than harm to a country, especially if its potential dangers can be avoided or minimised. Hosting a World Championship is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a country and an immense source of pride for its citizens.",

    "essay": "The globalised world these days makes it simpler than ever before for people to relocate and start building a life in a new country. As everyone comes from their own cultural background, a question arises of whether or not people should be expected to follow the customs of their host country. I completely agree with the view that while learning about the local customs may require some time and effort, it is valuable and will aid the integration of the newcomers into society.In many cultures following the local customs means showing respect, which is an important moral value in nearly every culture. The opposite is also true: disregarding traditions is often seen as a sign of disrespect. In order to establish good neighbourly relationships and feel welcome in the new place, it is important to demonstrate the effort to become part of the community. By expressing an interest in learning traditions, new arrivals gain a chance to interact with their neighbours and colleagues, get to know them and build some connections in the new country.Another positive aspect is the enhanced feeling of belonging that people get from participating in activities others around them are doing. When a national festival is in full swing, standing on the sidelines might make people feel excluded and perhaps even homesick, whereas joining others opens up opportunities to attend special events together, go to parties, meet new people and feel part of the celebrations. In Australia, for example, Easter is a very special time of the year and some of the traditional activities include Easter egg decoration and gifting, and baking hot cross buns; sharing your designs and recipes with others is an excellent conversation starter.In conclusion, learning the customs and traditions of oneÃ¢ÂÂs new country doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean a loss of their own culture. On the contrary, it is an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of cultural connections and should be embraced as a positive experience.",

    "essay": "The cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable; they exert a great deal of influence on our perception of the world. It is only reasonable to ponder whether or not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nationÃ¢ÂÂs own art, and not that of other countries. In my opinion, there should be an attempt to strike a balance and put the objects of national art in the spotlight, while allowing the public to get acquainted with foreign artworks to a certain extent.If people were to only find sculptures and paintings by national artists in their local museums, that would have a number of positive effects, such as the fame the artists of that country would gain and the pride its citizens would feel for their fellow countrymen. It would promote patriotism and strengthen the image of the country in the eyes of its inhabitants. Local artists would also receive more financial assistance from the government as their works would generate a significant amount of interest, potentially resulting in further development of the local art. However, in order to evolve art needs fresh ideas, and without exposure to a wider range of creativity the world provides, the evolution of local arts may be hindered.People enjoy art because it appeals to their inner sense of beauty and triggers strong emotions, and whether the masterpiece that causes these feelings belongs to a local or foreign artist is irrelevant. Talent knows no geographical boundaries; therefore, the emphasis should be on how much joy or amazement the work of art brings, rather than on its origin. If that principle were to be followed, we would never have to choose between local and international art. Reducing our museums or galleriesÃ¢ÂÂ collections to local art works, in my view, would be harmful and go against the democratic nature of art.To sum up, it seems to me that a country has nothing to lose by allowing its people to admire art created elsewhere in the world. A conscious choice by the government to support local artists while hosting exhibitions from other countries could prove the most beneficial.",

    "essay": "Young people today are under a lot of pressure, which seems to come from many directions. The problems they are experiencing happen not only at school, but also at home, and it seems that without adult guidance, our young generation will continue to struggle.Teenage years have never been simple, and many would agree that the amount of challenges has only increased with the passage of time. Bullying has been a problem for quite a while, and children and adolescents would have experienced it at school in the past, but then it would stop at home. At present, however, things have been made worse by social media penetrating the supposedly safe space of our teenagers. The unfortunate behaviour of their peers can now reach them even in their bedrooms, causing them constant distress.Another issue troubling many young people is the pressure to succeed by their families. Whether at school or at home, they often feel as if they are not smart enough, which creates overwhelm and despair. Understandably, their parents are pursuing a worthy goal of ensuring their children get a great start in life; however, many teens feel that they are failing their families when they donÃ¢ÂÂt live up to their expectations. This often leads to dishonest and unethical behaviour, such as cheating on tests or plagiarising other studentsÃ¢ÂÂ work. When uncovered, these incidents have a profound effect on young peopleÃ¢ÂÂs future careers, not to mention their emotional well-being.It is hard to underestimate the importance of parental support to navigating life as a young person. From helping teens build a positive body image and self-esteem, to handling classmatesÃ¢ÂÂ difficult behaviour, to guidance where study is concerned, parents can make a world of difference. Talking to their sons and daughters about matters that worry them, listening and making non-judgmental suggestions are great ways to help. Getting a professional involved where necessary and engaging with teachers, councilors and coaches is another opportunity for parents to provide assistance. Last but not least, parents can make their children better and happier people by simply giving them unconditional love.To sum up, being a young person in the modern world isnÃ¢ÂÂt easy. By banding together and paying careful attention to their teens, families can help them overcome any obstacles to becoming successful adults.",

    "essay": "Nowadays technology is advancing faster than ever and many fields are benefitting from the opportunities this trend presents. Some think that crime prevention can be one possible application of new technologies, by allowing to deter offenders or solve crimes in a faster and easier way. In my opinion, innovation in crime prevention can be a game-changer that will reduce both the number of crimes committed and the time it takes to catch those responsible for them.Not everyone is optimistic about the prospects of the use of new technologies in crime prevention, and those who subscribe to the more pessimistic view say that advanced technologies can be accessed by criminals, therefore raising the crime rates. Such tools can, indeed, cause more damage if they fall in the wrong hands; however, it would require the offenders to be highly skilled to be able to use the modern technologies. Statistically, many of them tend to have a lower level of education, and for that reason they are likely to stick to the old ways of committing crimes, whereas the minority of highly skilled criminals are unlikely to make a big difference to the crime levels.Law enforcement workforce, on the other hand, has a much better grip on modern technology. Nowadays police officers and detectives undergo special training, take regular skill update courses, and use high-tech equipment. Facial recognition and thermal imaging are just two examples of the important tools that police are already using to find and catch offenders faster. Ordinary citizens can do their part in preventing burglaries by installing sophisticated systems with sensors, CCTV video feed and various alarms to detect and deter thieves. The combined effort will, no doubt, push the crime curve down.To sum up, even though the wonders of technology are available to everyone, it seems to me that they will better assist law enforcement in solving crimes, and law-abiding citizens in protecting themselves and their property, rather than felons. This will tip the balance in favour of reduction in crime rate and make the world a safer place.",

    "essay": "It is often said that all influential TV entertainment programs should be geared towards raising peopleÃ¢ÂÂs awareness about social issues that matter. While some TV programs could be suitable for this purpose, I disagree with the view that it should be mandatory for all of them, as the decision whether to do so must take into account the nature of the TV content and the channelÃ¢ÂÂs audience.There is a large group of professionals who would benefit from deepening their understanding of what is happening in the world. Stock traders and bankers, for example, must always keep track of numerous business trends on a global scale, and they would appreciate this type of information on their favourite TV shows. Young people are another suitable audience due to the fact that they enjoy learning about popular topics from TV programmes. For instance, SDGs or the Sustainable Development Goals has now become an important topic to learn for children at school. Educational TV would provide a welcome alternative to textbooks, making learning more fun.Despite the potential advantages of incorporating educational content in TV programs, it is important to remember that the purpose of entertainment TV is for people to escape reality, to take a break from their hectic lives. Being reminded about some troubling social issues would not be appreciated by those who just want to unwind after a long day at work. Another consideration is how the content is perceived by the audience, because broadcasting serious topics as part of a comedy show might lead some viewers to believe they are of lesser significance. This would make TV shows of light-hearted nature a poor choice for inclusion of content on pressing social issues.In conclusion, entertainment TV programs can be an effective form of education for some people and a great tool to spread information. However, not all of them should be used for this purpose as there are various ways people appreciate them.",

    "essay": "In this fast-moving age, with the development of education and modern technologies, people strive to have a secure job after graduating from colleges and universities. Despite their efforts, so many young adults in different parts of the world have a negative experience of finding a long-term job.It so happens that most colleges and universities focus on studentsÃ¢ÂÂ academic performance much more than their practical skills. Unfortunately, many companies reserve permanent job opportunities for experienced applicants because there is no need to invest much in their training. Lack of practical experience in new graduates puts them at a disadvantage as far as companies are concerned. The situation is made worse by the abundance of advanced technologies that can easily replace human labor. Robots and computers work more efficiently and with higher precision than humans. That shrinks the pool of available job placements even more, as companies only need to hire highly educated and experienced staff.Fortunately, there is a number of solutions that can help inexperienced workers gain permanent employment. An obvious one is that universities could offer internships to their students, or arrange workshops in addition to classwork. This would help students to get training and experience in their respective fields. Also, the government could examine the demands of changing labor market and steer young people towards professions that will be popular in the coming years. Together with colleges and universities the government could create special awareness programs for graduates, providing them with an overview of various job offers and their benefits. This way students would be able to choose the right jobs for themselves.To sum up, lack of demand in the labour market and insufficient experience are two major reasons why many young people have trouble finding a permanent position. Helping them gain hands-on experience as part of their studies and educating them about career options early on is key to improving the employment outcome for them.",

Some say that new homes should be constructed in existing cities while others argue that new towns should be built to accommodate the growing population. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these points of view?",
    "essay": "In the past two decades, there has been an exponential increase in the migration of people to different cities and countries, indirectly resulting in a considerable infrastructure development. However, there has been a long-standing debate on whether to direct these infrastructure projects to current cities or establish new counties. Careful consideration of both alternatives reveals that each has its positives and negatives.One of the major advantages of focusing on current cities for new construction is that it would benefit the residents of the cities in multiple ways. Tenants living in Vancouver would prefer to buy a newly constructed house in the city where they work rather than in a new town, to reduce their commute time. Moreover, the city has everything they desire such as efficient public transport, thriving job market and affordable healthcare. This would not be possible in new towns because of the time it takes to establish services and generate opportunities for people.On the other hand, accommodating people in houses built in newly created towns would put them in a pollution-free and clean environment. This is because new towns may take at least 10 years of time to become an attractive spot for people and industries alike. As a result, their exposure to harmful emissions from industrial plants and transportation is reduced, shielding them from the risks of acquiring health complications. A recent report released by the word Health Organization (WHO) suggests that the number of people affected by airborne infections is 20% higher in cities compared to new towns that were formed just a couple of years ago.In conclusion, while there are both positive and negative aspects to these views, the decision on where to build the new homes to accommodate increasing population will depend on many other factors as well. Therefore, a thorough assessment is required before starting an infrastructure project.",

    "essay": "Choosing a future career requires careful consideration. While some people claim that adolescents should be able to pursue a career they would enjoy, others oppose to that, arguing that teenagers should aim for a high-paying job in order to secure a livelihood when they grow up. Given that our life consists of more than just physiological needs, I strongly believe that it is vital to fulfill oneÃ¢ÂÂs potential in the career fields that are most compatible with their interests.The youth who choose highly skilled jobs may find it easier to have a fruitful future in a materialistic sense. It is true that some professions, such as engineers or doctors, are well paid and offer more stability compared to work in other, non-professional fields. For example, psychologists usually have higher starting salaries compared to artists; they also rarely lose their jobs in recessions. People who prioritise earning a living might agree that a reliable job is a must for their future and by no means will they take risks to gain employment in a field they are passionate about, that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt pay well.However, it is worth remembering that we are living in a rapidly changing world and the concept of a Ã¢ÂÂguaranteed futureÃ¢ÂÂ is unrealistic. Even the smartest of us arenÃ¢ÂÂt prophets and it is impossible to foresee many changes in job markets in the future; some high-salaried jobs of today may no longer exist by the time our young people become adults. Therefore, people may choose to pursue their dreams and follow career paths according to their passions and interests now, to avoid having regrets later in life.Having considered the reasons to prefer monetary remuneration over oneÃ¢ÂÂs interests, I am convinced that it would be a pity for youths to limit their career choices to highly paid jobs of today.

    "essay": "The feasibility of shopping, working and communicating through the Internet is gradually eliminating the necessity of in-person encounters. I believe the merits of this opportunity outnumber its demerits and the lowered volume of traffic in addition to the possibility of long-range communication will be discussed as reasons for this claim in this essay.One chief benefit of using the Internet as a means of making purchases, working and communicating would be the lowered demand for transport, through eradicating the need for face-to-face contact. Such decreased volume of transportation would result in fewer harmful gas emissions which could significantly contribute to creating a cleaner environment. Furthermore, reduced commuting burden yields more free time for individuals. It could be spent in various ways such as working, studying and socialising with family and friends to name a few, which would be more productive and enjoyable.Another key merit of using the Internet would be the emergence of state-of-the-art telecommunication applications. These technologies have made it possible for those with access to the Internet to get in touch and send and receive audiovisual content by pushing just a few buttons. This presents a stark contrast to the situation only a few decades ago, when long-distance communication was possible solely through paper-based letters, which could possibly take months to reach the recipient.There are, however, some drawbacks to online communication, in particular the possibility that the lack of contact brought by technological advancements could potentially weaken human bonds. Taking into consideration that humans are sociable species, this could pose a dire threat to our mental health. This predicament, however, would be mitigated by the extra free time technological developments create for us. This free time could be spent with friends and family and in the long run would strengthen our relationships and improve our emotional wellbeing.To recapitulate, the InternetÃ¢ÂÂs demolishing the need for person-to-person contact brings about numerous benefits. A more sustainable environment as well as more free time generated for individuals, a reduced need to commute in addition to the feasibility of conducting long-distance communication in the easiest way possible, are all instances of the above-mentioned merits.",

They are alarmed by the declining ability of young people to read and write and its suspected link to the influence of modern technology, and I wholeheartedly share their view. This essay will outline the reasons to watch out for the consequences of widespread use of computers and mobile phones by our youngsters.Primary school is a very important period when children develop their fine motor skills, which are involved in learning to write. Time spent typing on a mobile phone or a tablet doesnÃ¢ÂÂt contribute to the necessary workout of the small muscles in the hands and fingers of young people. Not only do they get less practice in writing but also fewer opportunities to train in spelling words, since the Ã¢ÂÂautocorrectÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂautocompleteÃ¢ÂÂ features use the first few letters to guess the entire word, therefore making it unnecessary for the child to remember and type it correctly. Another companion of unrestrained use of mobile devices is the jargon that is often used in text messages, where words are shortened or distorted. Exposure to Ã¢ÂÂtextingÃ¢ÂÂ tends to replace the correct words with abbreviations in young minds, causing their spelling accuracy to decline.Reading is another casualty of unrestricted access to smart devices. Video content can be more appealing and immersive for kids and they often are automatically drawn to it instead of books. Reading requires regular practice and needs to become a habit in order to fully develop as a skill; however, it is being perceived as a boring and labourious activity by many youngsters compared to effortless video-watching. Easy and instant access to videos and movies pushes books further down the list of preferences of young audience, and it takes a significant commitment from parents and teachers to ensure that children continue to read books.To sum up, modern technology can be a friend or a foe for young children, depending on the choices adults in their lives make, regulating the amount of screen time and its purpose. Without due care the writing and reading abilities of kids can be harmed by other, more enjoyable activities they can use the devices for.",

    "prompt": "It is believed that people who read for pleasure develop their imagination more and acquire better language skills compared to people who prefer watching television. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
    "essay": "Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop oneÃ¢ÂÂs own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand oneÃ¢ÂÂs vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isnÃ¢ÂÂt always easy because the viewerÃ¢ÂÂs attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.",

    "prompt": "Scientists believe that the world is in danger due to environmental changes. Some people say that personal lifestyle changes should be made to reduce the damage to environment, while others think that the government should do something to help. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.",
    "essay": "Environmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in todayÃ¢ÂÂs world. One part of the society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the ecological situation. Others, on the other hand, believe that this issue should be solved on the governmental level. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and my perspective will be offered.It is hard to deny that human kind is responsible for the current environmental situation, and it seems impossible to achieve any noticeable result in this field without the participation of vast majority of individuals. For instance, a simple lifestyle change such as introducing the separation of household rubbish can make recycling projects more convenient and efficient. Moreover, consumers can reduce their usage of plastic items and, in turn, less plastic waste will contaminate the environment.However, many people still feel that the government has more tools to prevent environmental changes. One option that the authorities have is to discourage citizens from using personal vehicles by charging high taxes and additional fees. Moreover, politicians usually have access to resources to educate people about environmental problems and promote the most important ecological projects on all levels, ranging from special courses at schools to TV shows and websites related to this topic. Furthermore, it is a key responsibility of the government to protect the environment by spending state funds on research and modern equipment. Countries where legislation protects the ecology, for example Norway, have achieved visible results and overcame most environmental problems.In conclusion, I believe that a combined approach will work best to prevent or reverse environmental changes. A contribution of every individual is just as important as the intervention from the government in order to fix existing issues and save our planet for future generations.",

    "prompt": "Today children are spending much more time watching TV compared to the past. Why do you think this happens? Is this a positive or a negative change?",
    "essay": "A trend has emerged in the last two decades with youngsters watching more TV than ever before. One of the main reasons behind this issue is the recent advancements in technology in gaming and film industries. This tendency has both pros and cons, and will be further discussed in this essay.The latest developments in video game consoles attracted both children and adults to spend extra time watching TV, compared to the past. With interactive gaming characters and high quality graphics, children are more likely to spend long hours playing games in front of the TV. A recent survey showed that TV addiction among young people, for example, has significantly increased from 5% to 80%, which was supposedly caused by the introduction of advanced gaming consoles. This increase is also partially due to films, drama series and cartoons being easily available on pirated websites and various gaming platforms.This trend has had more negative than positive effects on young citizens. More time spent watching TV adversely affects the mental and physical wellbeing of a child. For instance, the obesity ratio among young individuals in the past 10 years has risen dramatically; this has caused further health problems such as anxiety and depression. However, TV can also be used in a positive way. It is a great source of information that can help youngsters increase their knowledge and succeed in their future careers.In conclusion, recent breakthroughs in technology are driving up the amount of time our youngsters are spending in front of their TV screens. This can do more harm than good if we donÃ¢ÂÂt regulate the use of TV, but parents have the power to make TV time useful and beneficial for their children.",

    "prompt": "High-rise vs. low-rise buildings, which solution is better for a growing population?",
    "essay": "Some cities create new housing for their growing populations by constructing a smaller number of high-rise buildings. Other cities create more of low-rise buildings. Which solution is better, in your opinion?Sample EssayRising population in urban areas leaves governments with no choice but to build more houses to meet the demand. However, when it comes to construction, there is more than one way to build new homes. Some cities prefer to construct fewer residential towers, while others build a larger number of low-rises for their residents. In this essay both options will be discussed and a viable solution will be suggested.One advantage of tall buildings is that they can accommodate a large number of people while having a small footprint. This type of construction is popular in central city areas where land is scarce and expensive. For example, in New York City high-rise buildings have significantly reduced housing problems, by as much as 55% in the last few years. As a result of this strategy, rents tend to decrease which has a further positive impact on the economies of such cities. However, tall buildings offer little or no privacy, they force certain rules and regulations upon residents, and attract higher maintenance costs.Given a chance to voice their opinion, many individuals would prefer to live in low-rise buildings or even build their own houses. This option might be more attractive for big families and for older generation people who like to have their own personal space. Accessibility is also a concern for the elderly as taking the stairs when the lifts break down may not be an option for them. In addition, one or two-story houses are easier and cheaper to maintain compared to modern apartment towers. The downside of this type of dwellings is that they occupy much more land, and since land is cheaper on city fringes, new estates tend to be built away from city centres. This increases commute time to work for their residents and negatively affects their quality of life.In conclusion, high-rise and low-rise buildings have their unique advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, high rises are more suitable for younger residents and should be built in the areas where young population is prevalent, closer to the city centre and employment opportunities. Senior citizens should have a supply of lower dwellings available in quieter locations. Such flexible approach can be a good way to address the needs of growing cityÃ¢ÂÂs population.",

    "essay": "Nowadays celebrities earn more money than politicians. What are the reasons for this? Is it a positive or negative development?Sample EssayNowadays celebrities make more money compared to people working in politics. This essay will look at the possible causes of this tendency and explain why, in my opinion, this is a negative development.There are two main reasons why celebrities generate more income than politicians. One of them is that with the advent of the Internet, there are more ways available for celebrities to earn money, such as online streaming services. For example, singing a song in a YouTube video with some advertisements enables them to easily make a few million dollars. Another cogent reason for this is the growing global concerns over excessively high remuneration for political leaders, which can easily lead to public discontent. In response to such criticism, many governments have decided to reform the reward system for lawmakers, sending their salaries on a downward trend.I personally believe that this development is relatively negative for several reasons, with the main one being the potential corruption scandals this issue can create. The enormous salary gap between celebrities and political leaders might discourage the legislators from putting in work or even motivate them to commit crimes such as money laundering. In addition, the relatively low salary for stressful jobs of governors may deter people with foresight on politics from becoming politicians. This is particularly undesirable because it would result in low level of citizensÃ¢ÂÂ loyalty to their incompetent government, creating unstable society with more crime and other social problems.In conclusion, the fact that celebrities are paid more than political leaders now is caused by a wider variety of income sources available to them, and supported by the social norm that a politician should not be a profit driven professional. However, I believe this is a negative trend which may lead to more political corruption and less talented governments.",

    "prompt": "Some people think that it is fine for professional athletes to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well (opinion)",
    "essay": "Some people think that it is fine for professional sportsmen and sportswomen to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Sample EssayAlthough most professional athletes are aware of their position as role models for their fans and behave accordingly, there are sportsmen and sportswomen who behave poorly during matches and in their private life. While some people find it acceptable as long as their performance on the field is not impacted, not everyone agrees with that point of view.Those who put athletesÃ¢ÂÂ performance on the field above everything else point out that competitive environment and immense pressure the sports people are under affect their behavior. They argue that athletes are entitled to privacy and their actions before and after games should not concern the general public. I find this hard to agree with, because poor behavior in sports people is incompatible with their role in publicÃ¢ÂÂs life and also for the reason that their actions could negatively affect their entire sports industry.The main reason why I believe athletes should behave well at all times is that their behavior is tremendously influential. Spectators respect players and many copy their actions and behavior; therefore, if top players misbehave or violate laws, some of the fans may feel compelled to follow their example and behave badly. For example, after an acclaimed baseball player was caught using drugs some years ago, the number of people who were arrested for the same crime significantly increased. This shows quite clearly why high profile players should consider their actions very carefully in order to promote a peaceful society.In addition, the behavior of athletes might affect the popularity of their sports. Some companies sponsor successful athletes who boost their brand recognition and sales of their products. Players and sports industry executives are financially compensated for endorsing products and participating in commercial advertisements. If they demonstrate poor behavior, sponsors could direct their money elsewhere, and as a result sports matches could suffer due to lack of funds. To illustrate, Sumo, a traditional Japanese sport, is held every season thanks to resources donated by companies. In a year when a Sumo player was involved in a violent crime, no matches were held, resulting in a large deficit of funds.In conclusion, I completely disagree with the opinion that top athletes are permitted to behave badly because their behavior may negatively influence the public behavior and sports industry itself.AssessorÃ¢ÂÂs comment: This response addresses both sides of the argument by exploring the reasons why some people think athletes are allowed to behave poorly as long as they play well, and the reasons why others think poor behavior has no excuse. This response deserves a high score for task achievement because of that. A good range of cohesive devices is used in this essay; that and the organisation of ideas makes it easy to follow. Sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is quite rich, the author also showed good control of grammar and spelling. It is worth noting that this sample is longer than the recommended 260 Ã¢ÂÂ 285 words, however, this isnÃ¢ÂÂt an issue provided the author can complete an essay of this length and quality in under 40 minutes. Overall this is a good example of a Band 8 essay.",

    "prompt": "Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military, while others disagree (opinion)",
    "essay": "Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military. Others think that women are less suitable for this kind of job. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Sample EssayIn recent years gender equality in employment has been the topic of heated debate. While some may argue that women are less suited for certain jobs such as with the police or the military, I believe that female candidates should be treated the same as their male counterparts.Those who consider women to be unsuited for some kinds of jobs including the police or the military often hold that opinion because such jobs are extremely physically demanding. As the female body has smaller muscles and less physical strength compared to male body, women may have difficulty engaging in strenuous activity which can be exhausting even for men. In military service, female soldiers are more likely to struggle while defending themselves than their male peers when they are forced to move around carrying heavy firearms in the battle, which can increase their risk of mission failure. Because of the hazards and extreme conditions they may encounter, some people advocate that women are not suitable for work in these fields.Nevertheless, I believe that female applicants should be considered for police or military placements without a gender bias, because women are more suited to certain tasks. In the police service, female officers can perform important roles on some occasions such as a body search where male officers are restricted from touching female convicts. In the military service, female nursing staff are more likely to care better for injured soldiers since maternal instinct makes them dedicated and heart-warming professionals. Furthermore, for the sake of fairness to all, job seekers should have an equal opportunity to choose their jobs freely, regardless of gender. Many women have the desire to work in the police and the military and some of them have relevant expertise and qualifications. Therefore, they should not be discriminated against in employment opportunities for these jobs.In conclusion, although some say that women are incompatible with police and military duties because of the high physical demands, I believe that they should be treated as equal to men. This is because there are certain roles with the police and the military that are more suitable for women than men, and therefore both genders should have equal employment opportunities.",

    "prompt": "In many countries young people start living on their own after high school, is this a positive or negative development?",
    "essay": "In many countries around the world young people decide to leave their parentsÃ¢ÂÂ home once they finish school. They start living on their own or sharing a house with friends. Is this a positive or a negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples.Sample EssayNowadays it is becoming increasingly common for youngsters to start their independent life by moving out of their parentsÃ¢ÂÂ home after graduation from school. This trend has positive effects on the society and the reasons behind it will be discussed next in this essay.There are various benefits for both young people and their parents when individuals start living independently after finishing school. Young adults, in this way, have to take care of their daily needs, from house chores, cooking or cleaning to financial independence. Thus, instead of wasting time on childish activities, they are motivated to learn skills and work part-time or full-time in order to cover their living expenses. Although it might seem challenging for them to live on their own at first, it would give them valuable experience, helping them to become mature, responsible adults. Parents would also be pleased with this practice since they can enjoy their own lives by having more time for themselves. Not only would they have more financial flexibility due to independence of their children, but they also donÃ¢ÂÂt have to change their habits in order to adapt to the new generationÃ¢ÂÂs lifestyle. For instance, it allows many people to travel around the world, which would be impossible if their children were to stay with them after finishing high school.Admittedly, there might be some challenges involved in this way of life. In some cases and especially under the influence of new friends or housemates, youngsters might choose to get involved in dangerous activities that involve drugs or petty crimes. However, instead of keeping their children close through adulthood, parents should prepare in advance and raise their children to distinguish between right and wrong and teach them to take responsibility for their actions.In conclusion, although there might be some adverse consequences to this relatively new practice, I believe that the advantages of young people leaving family home outweigh its drawbacks, for both children and parents.",

    "prompt": "In the past people wore their traditional clothes, but these days most people wear similar clothes, is this a positive or negative development?",
    "essay": "In the past, people wore their traditional clothes and followed their culture. These days, most people wear similar clothes and therefore look very similar to one another. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?Sample EssayThese days, peopleÃ¢ÂÂs perspectives on the value of clothing are changing, and individuals tend to wear similar clothing compared to people in the past who opted for their traditional clothing. I believe this tendency exerts a positive influence on the society.It is certainly true that there are some drawbacks to this tendency because it may lead to a loss of global diversity. It can be argued those who wear ordinary clothes such as T-shirts and jeans cannot feel a connection to their roots, and they are likely to neglect their culture and the contribution of their ancestors. Therefore, these people may not take pride in their region, and they might migrate to an urban location rather than contribute to the development of their community. Consequently, many ethnic minorities could suffer from depopulation and eventually disappear.However, I believe that there are more positives than negatives in people opting for similar clothes. The first explanation is that individuals can feel a sense of unity with people all over the world even though they have different religions and ways of life. This would motivate people in the world to support one another, instead of thinking that different parts of the world should deal with their own problems when natural disasters and other terrible problems occur in different nations. Furthermore, this tendency is economically profitable. Generally speaking, as ordinary clothes are automatically manufactured, they can be produced faster and more affordably than traditional clothing such as Japanese Kimono, which is hand-crafted.In conclusion, although people today tend to wear similar clothes instead of traditional ones and this trend cause several problems, I believe that the society as a whole can reap more benefits of this tendency.All parts of the task have been covered.

    "essay": "Some people think that it is best to encourage children to leave their family home as soon as possible. Others believe children should stay at the family home for as long as they like. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayAlthough it is thought by some that urging young people to abandon their family home at an early age is beneficial for them, others believe that it is better if children stay with their families for longer. In my opinion, leaving family home early has many advantages for children.On the one people think that youngsters ought to leave their parentsÃ¢ÂÂ house so as to learn life skills at an early age. Their reasoning is that it should push young people towards independence and make them learn from life lessons rather than merely rely on their parents. For example, students who pursue tertiary study away from their home city might learn taking personal responsibility. Also, living independently will teach children a lot by presenting some difficulties, which, consequently, will add some more experience that may prove essential in their future lives.On the other hand, it is argued that children should stay with their parents for longer for several reasons. Firstly, young people need advice from adults, and no one would be better suited to that than their parents. Secondly, life can be generally harsh, for children in particular. In other words, they might or take unnecessary risks if they mix with the wrong crowd. It is commonly known that young people tend to be by unethical people. To avoid that, being under parental supervision is utterly important for children.To sum up, while peopleÃ¢ÂÂs opinions may vary, I believe that young people should leave their family home at an early age, while parents ought to provide them with appropriate advice and keep an eye on their well-being.This essay covers the task by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of leaving the family home early in life, and the writerÃ¢ÂÂs opinion has been clearly stated.

    "essay": "When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers for people to spend their free time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Sample EssaySome people argue that town planners should have a preference for more parks and gyms to be created than business districts and shopping malls. While I understand the concerns of people who hold this opinion, it seems to me that shopping centers are just as important as parks and gyms in a town.There are reasons why public facilities are crucial to city inhabitants. First of all, they provide suitable spaces and equipment for people to exercise. For example, people can go jogging in the park and play tennis or basketball at the sports stadium. That helps to keep their bodies fit and it also elevates their mood during the day. Besides, parks and sports facilities are good spots for people to socialize with their neighbors. People can connect with others when they are playing sports or talking casually with passers by in the park. A harmonious relationship between residents helps build a caring and friendly neighborhood.Although parks and gyms give the town dwellers all kinds of benefits, I would like to point out the importance of shopping malls to the district. Firstly, a shopping center could make shopping more convenient for the local residents. It would enable them to easily purchase things in town and transport them home with less effort and at lower cost. They would not need to spend extra money on transportation or shipping of the goods. Secondly, a shopping mall can provide employment. Locals can find work in retail, maintenance or security of the mall, hence earning an income to support their families.In conclusion, although parks and sports facilities serve as places for exercise and social activities for city dwellers, I believe that shopping centers are equally important, since they can provide job opportunities and convenience to the town residents.This essay would score well on Task Achievement because it addresses all parts of the question, discusses reasons for and against building more parks than shopping malls and expresses the opinion of the writer.

    "prompt": "Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home, why and what are the advantages/disadvantages?",
    "essay": "Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home. Why do you think it happens? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a choice?It is a very popular practice in the modern society to order ready-made food from restaurants, rather than cooking at home. The main reasons for such a tendency may be cheap prices in some restaurants and peopleÃ¢ÂÂs desire to save some time . Even though ordering food some obvious advantages, its disadvantages should not be underestimated.On the one hand, ordering prepared food may be the best choice for a busy person, who does not have time for cooking and cleaning. Cooking food at home requires a considerable amount of time, moreover the cleaning process may take even more time and resources than cooking itself. For example, cooking a simple dish such as chicken with rice home requires significant amounts of water and electricity for electrical appliances such as the oven and dishwasher. Hence, having an opportunity to order food from a restaurant will save a lot of time, electricity and water.On the other hand, delegating the process of cooking to some restaurant a dramatic disadvantage of not having the information about the ingredients used in the meals. With high demand, grow the volumes of required products, which sometimes can affect the quality of purchased produce. For example, it is a very common practice in some restaurants to make salads from products that are about to go bad and mask the rotten scent by adding some chemicals and spices. Hence, some restaurants may use poor quality products or chemicals for boosting taste and preservatives, which may have a negative effect on the customerÃ¢ÂÂs health in the long run.In conclusion, ordering food from restaurants may be a tempting choice for people who have no time for cooking at home, but this approach has a critical disadvantage of being not informed about the ingredients used in the meal, which can have destructive consequences.This response covers the task requirements by giving a reason why people would choose to buy ready-made food and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of this trend. The ideas are conveyed quite clearly and supported by examples, paragraphing helps to present the information in a neat and easy to follow way, and the level of coherence is adequate in this essay. A range of complex sentence forms and advanced vocabulary is used and there are very few instances of erroneous grammar or inaccurate expressions (see corrections underlined in blue). Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.",

    "prompt": "Nowadays that many women have full time jobs, it is logical to share the housework evenly between men and women (agree/disagree)",
    "essay": "Nowadays in many countries women have full time jobs. Therefore, it is logical to share household tasks evenly between men and women. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Nowadays an ever-increasing number of women work full time, and in this reality it is widely believed that house chores should be shared between men and women equally. I strongly agree with this statement.One of the reasons for sharing housework between is to promote gender equality. A stereotype that has existed a long time is that females ought to stay home, taking care of the family once they got married. This includes looking after the children and doing all of the housework, which is fairly labour-intensive. However, this approach could have quite a few disadvantages. It would render women less able of keeping abreast of what is happening in the job market, thus forming a lifestyle where they might find it arduous to step into the society again. To avoid this, many women are willing to get back into the workforce soon after their maternity leave, and once they do, it makes sense that their husbands should share part of the household chores, to fulfill their family responsibilities.Nevertheless, we cannot be oblivious several drawbacks of this trend. One potential downside is that men are less experienced in dealing with household tasks. This is because many seldom take an active role in doing housework, according to customs of many countries. As a result, they may end up doing household tasks in a less than perfect way, which could contribute to some unnecessary quarrels between partners, hindering their family bond. However, the likelihood of this happening isnÃ¢ÂÂt very high, because wives can offer some tips or guidance to their husbands when they learn how to share house chores such as mopping floors or doing laundry.To sum up, although some conflicts might be triggered when equally sharing the duties of household tasks, the benefits of this trend are relatively oblivious.The writer covered the task well by discussing the positives and negatives of sharing housework equally between men and women. Each paragraph has a clear purpose and assists with orderly presentation of ideas, making this essay easy to follow. The ideas are explained and substantiated, and the writerÃ¢ÂÂs opinion is clear. The range of vocabulary is wide enough to avoid unnecessary repetition. Accuracy of expression could be improved (see corrections underlined in blue), but all in all this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.",

    "prompt": "Some believe the government should take care of retirees, while others think everyone should save for their own retirement (opinion)",
    "essay": "Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding oneÃ¢ÂÂs own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age, including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.This response addresses all parts of the topic, by discussing the merits of funding oneÃ¢ÂÂs own retirement versus relying on government pension. The writerÃ¢ÂÂs opinion has been stated as well and is very clear. The neat presentation of ideas has been helped by appropriate paragraphing, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. The authorÃ¢ÂÂs vocabulary seems to be rich and there is a variety of sentence structures used in this essay. Overall, this essay deserves an IELTS Band 8.",

    "essay": "Some people say that art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are an essential part of education, and every school should include them in its syllabus. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and examples from your own experience.Art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are fundamentals that enrich our lives. However, some parents say schools on teaching more academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature and history. In my opinion, both academic and arts subjects should be taught and I will expand on the pros and cons of including arts in the school program further on in this essay.On the one hand, academic subjects are often required when we get into higher . Academic subjects may be considered as in the academic world. Personally, I have never taken an entrance exam of art subjects for high school or university. In other words, schools measured my academic abilities using academic subjects, not art subjects. To suit the current educational system, many parents in my home country, Japan, send their children to cram schools to study academic subjects deeply.On the other hand, art subjects can strengthen the creativity and flexibility of individuals. Liberal arts, which include cultural understanding and knowledge, also include other arts subjects. In addition, we are living in the era of automation and artificial intelligence which are replacing human labor and office work more and more. In this regard, human creativity becomes more important. Therefore, art subjects are being more in demand to make a difference between individuals and computers.In conclusion, academic and arts subjects should blend in a school syllabus in a balanced way. Art subjects can also a better personality in individuals, so participation in these classes should be encouraged as well as academic achievements.The writer explored the reasons why including arts subjects in school syllabus is a good idea, while fluently expressing ideas and supporting them by examples.

    "prompt": "Nowadays people waste a lot of food, why is this happening and how to reduce waste?",
    "essay": "Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?At the time when famines heavily strike impoverished third world countries, many people living in wealthy countries waste tremendous amounts of food daily. In my opinion, understanding the probable reasons of this phenomenon is important and may lead us to some applicable solutions that will result in reducing food waste.The low cost of food seems to be one of the obvious reasons, exacerbating the problem. Due to the revolutionary technological achievements, people have increased both the quality and the quantity of their crops. In turn, according to the laws of supply and demand, the prices of the crops have immensely dropped. A recent study of the FAO stated that the global crops prices have dropped 50 per cent over the last decade. This enabled people to buy excessive amounts of food without a real need.Furthermore, the absence of strict regulations to discourage or punish this attitude can also be considered a major cause. Not everyone is aware that wasting food may create problems. Consequently, they are likely to resist any calls for controlling the consumption of dietary supplies unless they are forced by the power of law. Several countries in the world saw a drop in their national food waste after implementing a ban on the excessive purchasing of food.Fortunately, there are some possible approaches that can be adopted by both people and governments. Firstly, raising the awareness of this issue is immensely important. Using social media platforms can draw public attention to the potential dangers of food waste and how communities can confront it. Secondly, enforcing laws that prohibit the wasting of food by people and companies will deter such harmful practice.In conclusion, the decreased price of food as well as lack of regulations allowed the unfortunate trend of throwing away food to continue. I believe that creating awareness and legislation are parts of a straightforward solution to this issue.The writer explored the reasons for throwing away food and suggested some solutions, effortlessly conveying his/her ideas in this well-written IELTS essay. The information is presented in an orderly, logical and coherent way. A wide range of vocabulary is used in this written response. The sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is impressive.

    "prompt": "Some parents encourage young people to leave home while others think they should stay with the family, discuss and give your opinion",
    "essay": "Many parents encourage young people to leave home when they become older, while others think they should stay at home with the family. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.With the tremendous influence of modernisation, remarkable changes have taken place in the family structure to such an extent that nowadays, youngsters are motivated by their parents to live alone as they grow up. However, some people are of the view that it is more practical for a youngster to live with their family.On the one hand, there are many positive aspects to youths living away from their parents at young age. This provides the opportunity to young people to live a life on their own terms and make any decisions without the interference of their parents. Besides, living alone not only makes them independent but also makes them self-reliant, which is a crucial life skill to their successful career. For instance, managing all the house chores such as cleaning, paying bills, cooking and so on will make them well experienced at learning and managing diverse activities and will also boost their confidence.On the other hand, there is no denying the fact that youngsters living away from their family may find themselves in circumstances that may adversely affect their life. NaÃÂ¯ve and inexperienced young people in the absence of parental supervision are more likely to fall prey to bad influence and dangerous activities, such as drugs or alcohol consumption, which may jeopardise their career or lead them astray from moral values. However, this situation is less likely to take place with youngsters still living with their parents. Besides, emotional bonding and family relationships can be maintained better if everyone is living together under one roof.In my opinion, although encouraging youngsters to live alone may lead them to learn various life skills, negative aspects and risks associated with living alone can far outweigh the benefits.This response covers the task topic well, by discussing the positive and negative aspects of living alone as a young adult, and the writerÃ¢ÂÂs opinion has also been included.

    "essay": "Many people believe that learning a foreign language is a very difficult task. What are the most difficult things about learning a foreign language? What is the best way to overcome them? Explain and include your personal experience or knowledge of these problems.It is true that acquiring new language skills is by no means an easy task. Language learners might encounter several challenges such as unfamiliar accents or grammar structures a foreign language. However, in my opinion, such difficulties can be tackled by a well-rounded education system.When it comes to languages, it is undeniably crucial to get used to a native accent and intonation for effective communication. However, picking up an accurate accent can be enormously difficult, especially for adult learners because of their lack of language learning ability. If a language learner has an unrecognisable accent and intonation, they would not be understood by native speakers. On top of that, each language has different grammar and typical grammatical sequencing of words. For example, Korean sentences always end with verbs whilst English not, which means that a Korean English-learner should the correct order of words.Despite the aforementioned difficulties, I strongly believe that everyone can master a foreign language when a couple of feasible steps are taken. Firstly, it is more important than anything to start learning a new language at a young age. By incorporating foreign language programmes in the primary school curriculum, children can easily be exposed to languages of the world and eventually acquire language skills without difficulties. Secondly, the government can financially subsidise schools to run student exchange programmes that help adolescents to get experiences abroad and make friends overseas while improving their foreign language in a way.In conclusion, I believe that individuals can have difficulties in learning a new language because of different accents and unfamiliar grammar, however, these problems can be overcome by a good quality of education system subsidised by governments.The writer covered the task by talking about some difficult aspects of learning a new language and steps to overcome them.

    "prompt": "Should employers pay more attention to personal qualities rather than qualifications?",
    "essay": "While recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and include relevant examples.Recent decades have witnessed a burgeoning growth of numerous industries; therefore, recruiting the right person for the position is crucial to the development of enterprises. But how do we determine if a person is the best fit? Advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job. Nevertheless, some people argue that candidatesÃ¢ÂÂ personal qualities cannot be ignored. In my view, both components are of equal importance.To begin with, the conventional approach of checking potential workersÃ¢ÂÂ qualifications via their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital. Apparently, whenever we submit a job application, we are always required to attach a CV while a cover letter is optional. Without a decent qualification, even if that candidateÃ¢ÂÂs personal characteristics are suitable, the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually.On the other hand, occasionally during an interview some HR officers ignore the significance of assessing how candidatesÃ¢ÂÂ individual qualities can fit in the company. Employers should assess not only candidatesÃ¢ÂÂ qualifications but also their enabling skills, ethics and value propositions. The more an employeeÃ¢ÂÂs personal qualities fit in a companyÃ¢ÂÂs culture and values, the more he or she is motivated to contribute to that companyÃ¢ÂÂs vision. KPMG is a great example of evaluating candidatesÃ¢ÂÂ personal qualifications and skills by utilising a game-based assessment process, followed by a video interview. This methodology enables a comprehensive assessment, and is embraced by many companies nowadays.To summarise, employers should assess both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting people as each of these elements has its own vital contribution to make in talent-seeking enterprises.This response covers the topic well.

    "essay": "Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your own opinion and examples from your experience.At present, the Internet plays a vital role in almost every aspect of human life. As a result, individuals are searching online reasonable solutions to their illnesses. Not everyone is convinced that access to such information online is safe and helpful. However, in my view, providing the general public with access to trustworthy information about medical disorders would invariably improve the quality of the medical care for the whole society.Nowadays, even though there are plenty of online platforms developed for medical education, most of the sites have not been written by professional healthcare providers. Hence, there is a high possibility of spreading wrong medical information throughout the world, unless the site developers are held accountable for the content they provide. If patients receive incorrect information about a medical procedure and follow the wrong advice, for instance, to remove a wart at home, it might lead to a serious infection, excessive bleeding or another medical emergency. That would constitute a negative effect of using online knowledge for medical treatments at home rather than visiting a professional.On the flip side, the Internet, the society is well aware of most common medical disorders and preventive measures. Consequently, a reasonable and prudent individual can decide whether to get professional opinion on oneÃ¢ÂÂs disease or to handle it at home, that they get reliable online medical information. Moreover, if patients can manage mild medical problems themselves, it would certainly reduce the workload at the local hospitals, freeing more doctors for patients in real need. Besides, if patients come with a certain extent of knowledge about their condition to the medical consultation, it would invariably be helpful to the medical practitioner for effective decision making.To sum up, it is evident that online search for information on medical disorders can be a positive development as long as the general public receives trustworthy information.This response addresses the topic well.

    "prompt": "Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves, why is this happening?",
    "essay": "Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves. What are the reasons? Is it a positive or negative trend?These days a vast majority of people want to lead an independent life. The fundamental reason lies in peopleÃ¢ÂÂs educational qualifications that fuel their craving for freedom in life. This can be seen as a positive trend because living alone is likely to nurture a mature mindset at early stages of oneÃ¢ÂÂs life.Many people are well educated to stand up on their own. Tertiary education broadens their horizons, and they wish to experience freedom of life. With a very good educational background it becomes easier to find a well-paid job, and with lucrative income they gain confidence to lead an independent life, thereby achieving their goals. For example, engineering graduates can find a job in another town and their salary is enough for them to move and settle down there. This enables them to move away from their family and live on their own.Living alone helps one to develop maturity, which can be seen as a positive impact on individuals and the society as a whole. Being independent means young people have to face life challenges alone and going through this process improves their resilience. They become more responsible, as they have to take care of themselves and develop budgeting skills and saving habits, for their future needs as well. Better planning of their finances nurtures the custom of wise spending at early stages of adult life.In conclusion, the reason why many people wish to live independently these days is because their education level gives them both the awareness of freedom in life and means of achieving it. Since living alone promotes oneÃ¢ÂÂs maturity, it seems to be a positive trend in todayÃ¢ÂÂs society.This response covers the task requirements by addressing the two parts of the question, why people choose to live alone and whether this is a positive trend.

Many people may heavily rely on quality education as preparation for real life employment and experiences. However, there are other factors that are needed to propel a country towards success.We must acknowledge the way the education system of a country prepares most individuals by equipping them with various skills. Prior to gaining a qualification to practice certain professions such as teaching, nursing or accounting, it is necessary for the individuals to undergo rigorous training. Certificate and diploma programs as well as university degrees are good examples of that.

However, it seems that producing graduates alone isnÃ¢ÂÂt a guarantee of the advancement of a country. There are other factors that should come into play, and motivation of individuals is one. Without motivation, people may lose track of what they intend to do to contribute to the improvement of a country. drives people to achieve and maximize their potentials, because they are determined to get better at many aspects of their life, eventually yielding improvement for their entire country.Furthermore, the availability of natural resources and job opportunities may also affect the growth of a national economy. Innovations of many individuals require raw materials, and should the country be able to mine these, their production and perhaps even export may help in stabilizing the local market. Finally, it is also important that the availability of employment is aligned with the skills of individuals applying for the positions.

Why do you think this is happening? What can be done to help children stay healthy?Write at least 250 wordsFor many years obesity was perceived as a condition occurring only in adult life. However, in recent years the number of children suffering from obesity has grown significantly. There are several causes and numerous solutions which can be used to tackle this worrying phenomenon, and this essay will present a couple of them.While some reasons for childhood obesity are genetic, others include poor food choices exacerbated by easy availability of fast food, insufficient physical activity and a history of family members being overweight. Unlike the former, the latter factors can be changed, if the adults in the childÃ¢ÂÂs life gain awareness and are willing to take action.To begin with, health is a complex matter which requires a balanced approach. In other words, there isnÃ¢ÂÂt a single solution to maintain health, on the contrary, it is rather a mixture of multiple factors, such as and regular physical activity. For this reason, increasing the awareness of healthy habits among children is a responsibility of utmost importance. What is more, it can be easily achieved through the education system.On the other hand, childrenÃ¢ÂÂs education might to stop the situation from worsening. Along with well designed health education schemes, we should also try to stop food companies from overusing sugar in products the young ones. It has been proven that more than 70% of the products available in an average supermarket contain dangerously high levels of white sugar. Sugar rich diet not only causes a significant weight gain, but also contributes to diseases, such as diabetes in young population.To summarize, emphasis put on the awareness of healthy living among children is invaluable. Furthermore, combining healthy habits with stopping food companies from in products which are easily children can be effectively implemented by the governments.

Thus, it is considered by some that it should be mandatory to educate school children the administration of money. In my opinion, people should not leave school without a sound knowledge of financial management.To begin with, a countryÃ¢ÂÂs development is strongly upon the purchasing capacity of its inhabitants. That is to say, people who are in debt or financially vulnerable, would not be able to spend freely or invest, for example, in a new house, thus hindering the economic growth of the country. As a consequence, the rate of inflation would rise and people would be able to afford even less, which could ultimately result in the collapse of the entire economy. A good example of this vicious circle can be seen in countries such as Argentina, where people have to buy household items in the black market, because they cannot afford to buy them in regular stores due to skyrocketing prices. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to teach children early money management.Another point to consider is the low standard of living that people have when they mismanage their finances. Individuals who are constantly short of money could eventually end up being socially isolated and unhappy, because they couldnÃ¢ÂÂt afford to participate in leisure activities, such as going to the cinema with a friend, resulting in their from social life. However, this could be avoided with ease by offering courses in money management.In conclusion, I strongly believe that school children should be taught how to manage their finances to prevent social isolation later in their life as well as to maintain the economic force of their country.The writerÃ¢ÂÂs position is clear throughout the essay.

A better regulative approach is required traffic accidents can be reduced. Some people say that changing the driversÃ¢ÂÂ age limits is the best solution to the problem. However, there are other, more practical ways to deal with this problem.One alternative is imposing heavier fines the drivers who exceed the permitted alcohol consumption. According to recent , a great proportion of traffic accidents has alcohol as its reason. Utilising technology and installing devices that detect drunk drivers and lock car ignition can be used to keep people with track record of drunk driving off the roads. On some occasions and for repeat offenders in particular, a prison sentence may also be considered.Furthermore, people should be better educated and more careful while behind the wheel. To be more specific, people should learn to obey road rules and respect the other drivers instead of causing tension or submitting to road rage. In addition, heavy fines should also be levied for exceeded speed limits. Last but not least, safer and wider roads should be constructed to make for easier and more comfortable driving.Tightening age limits for drivers can be a complementary approach. For example, the elderly with vision problems or other important health issues should be excluded from driving. Besides, young people under 18 years old are considered immature to drive. However, maturity does not necessarily always increases with oneÃ¢ÂÂs age, which is why other measures are needed dangerous driving.In conclusion, I believe that stronger measures should be implemented for the prevention of traffic accidents, and drivers should have a more responsible attitude. Setting age limits could be helpful but should not be considered the optimal and only solution to the problem.The writerÃ¢ÂÂs position is clear throughout the essay.

    "prompt": "IELTS Essay, topic: Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between the rich and poor, while others disagree (discuss)",
    "essay": "Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between rich and poor people, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.There is no doubt that modern technology is reshaping our planet and affecting every aspect of human lives. From a social perspective, many people argue that the gap between the upper class and lower classes is widening as a result of technological advancements. Others, however, believe the opposite.There are several reasons why one could think that the wealth inequality is, indeed, increasing. The most common reason is automation. Driven by technology, automation reduces the need for manual labour. As a result, less work opportunities are available for unskilled people. With each iteration of the cycle the competition increases and wages decrease. , technology has increased the minimum level of needs that should be satisfied. Nowadays, everybody should have a mobile phone and an internet connection, including the poor. This increases the monetary burden on them as they must borrow to cover these new needs.However, I firmly believe that the aforementioned opinion is ludicrous. The most obvious reason is that modern technology has facilitated the road to riches in an unprecedented manner. For instance, many of the internet billionaires are from lower and middle classes. Moreover, the major leaps in agricultural technologies magnified food production. As a result, food has become more affordable and available. Finally, leveraging technology has dramatically increased workersÃ¢ÂÂ productivity. Consequently, compensations and salaries have increased.In conclusion, I strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the difference between social classes. Increased food production, opportunities and productivity are just few examples of technologyÃ¢ÂÂs contribution to bridging the wealth gap.This essay adequately covers all parts of the task. The ideas expressed in this written response are relevant, well-developed, ordered in a logical way and supported. The paragraphing is suitable and cohesion is maintained throughout the essay.

    "prompt": "Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents (agree/disagree)",
    "essay": "Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion and include relevant examples.It is true that parents need some knowledge and experience in order to raise their in an appropriate way. In this regard, many families attend different training courses. While I agree that these courses might be useful for some of them, I totally disagree with the recommended obligatory of such training.On the one hand, training courses usually offered by governments could be very useful for those guardians who have a with special needs. For example, if a child has a birth defect or has been diagnosed with any mental or musculoskeletal disorders, these kinds of training could be lifesaving. Additionally, as we know, the first few months after birth are really a crucial period of a childÃ¢ÂÂs life; parents should obtain different information related to their childÃ¢ÂÂs vaccinations, common health problems, different developmental issues and so on, which can be delivered through such training courses.On the other hand, I believe that making these programs a mandatory option would cause several problems for societies and individuals as well. To begin with, in order to achieve this goal, many professionals should be trained which may not be affordable for some governments. From an individualÃ¢ÂÂs point of view, this kind of programs could be very time-consuming for some families who have other at home or who work long hours. The other important consideration is that parent training courses may not provide all the necessary information for each and every family. To be more specific, parents could get more beneficial information through different websites such as YouTube according to their own preferences.In conclusion, although I believe that many families can take advantage training courses, I do believe that making them a compulsory option for everyone is too time and money-consuming for individuals and governments.The introduction is very good and relevant. The writerÃ¢ÂÂs position is balanced, relevantly and properly developed in two body paragraphs. The conclusion summarizes both sides of the argument and logically finished the essay. To maintain the necessary level of formality the word Ã¢ÂÂkidsÃ¢ÂÂ should be replaced with Ã¢ÂÂchildrenÃ¢ÂÂ everywhere in this essay. The use of prepositions needs more attention as some are inappropriate or incorrect. The length could be reduced Ã¢ÂÂ itÃ¢ÂÂs not necessary to write a very long essay to get a higher score, and often it is better to write a shorter essay (no shorter than 250 words though!) but spend more time proofreading, correcting errors and improving the quality of writing.

    "prompt": "Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement (agree/disagree)",
    "essay": "Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement. Do you think there are other measures that could be put in place? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?One of the most conspicuous trends of todayÃ¢ÂÂs world is a colossal surge in the number of vehicle accidents cars, trucks and buses, all over the , be it in impoverished or developed nations. There is a wide range of factors that . In my opinion, this situation could be remedied, provided some effective measures are taken.Measures to deal with this soaring concern are many; the most significant are not remote or complicated but accessible and practicable. The primary one lies in the fact that governments should take a firm stance and apply stringent rules and regulations to lower the speed limit. Secondly, using electronic devices while driving should be forbidden by law. Finally, an awareness program could be initiated by individuals to educate the public about the catastrophic effects of unsafe roads and the projected enhancements for road safety. Only when convergent efforts from all sectors are ensured, can we expect to see considerable progress in tackling this problem.There is a deluge of merits for implementation of reduced speed limits. High speed is likely to impose life threatening danger on people crossing the roads, due to the perilous nature of this hazardous speed with danger being an integral part of it. Not only does reducing the speed limits contribute to decreasing daily accidents, but it also raises the standard of driving. Needless to say, all these advantages have a far-reaching impact on pedestrian safety.There are, however, some pitfalls that can easily overpower the potential benefits of limiting speed. The primary one stems from the fact that slowing the speed could lead to augmenting the daily traffic hours. Besides, it could also delay delivering sick and patients to hospitals. Hence, it is apparent why some individuals are against changing the standardized level of speed.From what has been discussed, one can conclude that despite the drawbacks of reducing speed limits, the expected benefits of this measure are indeed far greater.All the parts of the task have been covered fairly well. The response presents a wellÃ¢ÂÂdeveloped position that addresses all parts of the task prompt with suitable, widely covered and thoroughly supported ideas. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of task response. There are some mistakes in word choice and grammar.

    "essay": "Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. Nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries . Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.Those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. Their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a childÃ¢ÂÂs personality. There is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. As a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. It is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. It fosters young social and emotional capabilities. Moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to and practice new languages. Mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. According to a recent study published by the University of Chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects. Acquiring new languages, and an open minded and tolerant personality are just few examples of the many possible benefits.This essay presents a wellÃ¢ÂÂdeveloped position that addresses all parts of the task prompt.

What are some simple actions that could help the environment?It is commonly believed that preservation of natural resources is imperative, yet most people seem to exert no effort in doing so. Understanding the causes of this negligent attitude may help with devising some simple measures to safeguard the deteriorating environment.Lack of awareness is probably the foremost reason why the vast majority of individuals appears to be unmindful of the current environmental issues. Normally, people have tendency to downplay abstract problems, or those to happen in the distant future. This is because they are not properly informed of the possible detrimental effects of taking the environment for granted. To illustrate, residents in urban areas often deliberately dump their into the nearby creeks and drainage canals causing them to become clogged. It is only when devastating floods strike, that they come to realize the consequences of their actions.Some basic solutions that could be carried out are extensive awareness through all forms of communication and strict implementation of waste management. In addition to the traditional press, social media is a powerful means of disseminating information regarding the impending disasters and their potential hazards. This is a good way of persuading the public to actively take part in the campaign. Another straightforward solution, and by far the least anyone can do to help save the nature is disposing of garbage thoughtfully. Apart from avoiding throwing trash anywhere, everyone should practice proper segregation of biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable wastes at all times. These actions, when coordinated by the local governments, can be tremendously successful.In conclusion, while individual awareness is key to maintaining a healthy ecosystem, concerted efforts of governments and are much more effective in achieving such goal.The response is well written, it contains reasons, solutions and fully addresses the task.

    "essay": "Some believe that people should not continue to work once they reach the age of retirement. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience.In recent years, with the improvement in healthcare sector and better , people are able to live longer and contribute to the economic progress of a nation more, compared to the past. Some see this as an entirely positive development, while others point out the drawbacks of working beyond the retirement age.Delaying retirement enables individuals to actively contribute to the society. On a personal level, working past retirement age provides an avenue for individuals to remain not only physically but also mentally active. Moreover, this option empowers the ageing population to be financially independent and economically self-sustainable past retirement age. In countries with growing ageing population such as Singapore, for instance, citizens are given an option to work beyond their retirement age based on the demands of their job and their capability to handle these tasks. Hence, working beyond retirement age empowers workers, ensures economic progression of the nation, and alleviates the challenges faced by an ageing population.On the flip side, working beyond the retirement age may result in adverse health impacts on workers and a decrease in productivity levels. In Japan, the suicide rates have recently been increasing due to rising stress levels at work faced by the ageing population who are pushed to work beyond their optimal capacity. Escalating stress levels from work to various health complications putting a strain on the healthcare system. Hence, working beyond retirement age may worsen the overall welfare of individuals and adversely impact the economy.To sum up, though working beyond retirement age health hazards leading to reduction in productivity levels, it seems to me that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, by assessing the capability of individuals and tailoring their jobs to their health profile, firms and companies should actively involve their workers to be productive beyond their retirement age.This essay is an excellent example of IELTS Band 8 writing. The author presents sound arguments making his/her point of view very clear, examples are being used to support the writerÃ¢ÂÂs points and the organisation of information is handled very well.

The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension.

    "essay": "In many countries senior positions have higher salaries compared to those of young workers of the same company. Some people think this isnÃ¢ÂÂt justified. Do you agree or disagree?While some believe that rewarding those in managerial positions with higher pay packets is appropriate, not everyone agrees with this view. Personally, I am leaning towards the latter position due to negative impacts caused by significant difference in salaries within a company.For one, executive officers should know that higher than sufficient salaries are not necessary. Indeed, the higher the remuneration they receive, the more likely the company to suffer from devoid of financial capability. Furthermore, they often gain powers that money canÃ¢ÂÂt buy. For instance, they often make important decisions over how to make their company thrive. They are also entitled to allocate companyÃ¢ÂÂs budget and designate tasks to other workers. these non-financial entitlements, they should refrain from earning more than reasonable amounts as salaries.Unreasonably high salaries granted to the executives can also afflict other employees. In fact, it is foreseeable that many employees would feel powerless or even when they find out about the huge salary gap between the executive officersÃ¢ÂÂ and theirs. Accordingly, some may leave the company, and others may go on to strike and demand a pay increase. However, those actions . Therefore, unfair salary systems like this would yield unhealthy working environment for both employers and employees.In conclusion, I oppose to those in managerial roles with obscene amounts of compensation because it can cost the company its prosperity and discourage other employees .

To what extent do you agree or disagree?With the advent of the Internet, advertisements, originally displayed only on TV, billboards, posters and so on, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and commonplace for the general public. In my view, this kind of impact could be both crucial and, on a certain level, detrimental.On the one hand, this phenomenon could denote that although we have already had a diverse range of , people are still capable of inventing innovative approaches catering for all kinds of requirements of advertising. It is a symbol that demonstrates the creativity rooted in human beings. Apart from that, it also represents that the speed of spreading information is conspicuously escalating. More purposeful is, therefore, the fact that, besides booming of the advertising, it constitutes a major reason why people could be so prosperous in this digital age.On the other hand, there are various unpleasant consequences as well. Firstly, with the omnipresent , it could potentially cause people to do impulsive shopping. Secondly, the , if regulated in a mismanaged , could make people constantly feel uncomfortable or annoyed. In this sense, instead of being an instrumental tool to promote amenities, advertisements could be considered a hindrance when people are frequently blocked by them. Furthermore, it would cost one precious time to have to sift the helpful ad from a host of others.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, advertising is a beneficial phenomenon for all with a number of insignificant drawbacks. I believe that in the future we can improve the way advertising is done at present, and embrace the positive influence of advertising even further in the long run.This essay is another example of what Band 8 writing may look like.

What can be done to change this negative attitude towards international tourism?Many individuals think that foreign tourism brings negative effects to their countries. There are several reasons for such negative attitude towards international travelers. However, a couple of solutions could be adopted to handle this situation, as will now be discussed.International tourists are often criticized for their contribution to the environmental degradation. It has continuously been noticed that they throw rubbish in their surroundings irresponsibly, which increases the amount of litter everywhere, despite all attempts to reduce waste produced by the local community. This contributes to water, air and soil contamination.Furthermore, foreign tourism has a harmful influence on traditional customs and indigenous practices of host countries because many tourists are careless and insensitive the emotions and feelings of local residents. For instance, in India, some foreign travelers wear inappropriate clothes or expose too much of skin when they visit sacred places, which leads to some negative attitude and the local public.However, this situation can be improved different solutions which could be handled by the government. The government should explain the benefits of international tourism which contributes to the development of local . They not only spend money in shops and restaurants but also create jobs in service industries, and this aspect could be publicized. Additionally, the government should increase the awareness among the foreigners through different media such as roadside billboards and advertisements, and tourists should be encouraged to get rid of rubbish correctly.In conclusion, the inhospitable feeling that the local people have for international tourists can be explained in many ways. However, in my opinion, the governmentÃ¢ÂÂs involvement is essential to change the negative attitude by citing various advantages of international tourism to their country and raising awareness among tourists in order to protect local habitats.This essay covers the entire task topic by exploring both reasons for negative attitude towards international tourism and some possible actions to change it.

    "essay": "Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research for the benefit of human beings, while others argue that it is wrong. Discuss both views and give your opinion.People have different views on how medical research should be conducted and tested. Although many people support the use of for developing medicines, I personally believe that animal testing is morally wrong.The main reason why some people value to conduct medical research is because animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments. It is true that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. For example, experiments in which dogs had their pancreases removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, critical to saving the lives of diabetics. Furthermore, it is impossible to release to the market before proving it no harm to humans and laboratory mice are appropriate research subjects because they are similar to human beings in many ways.However, I people who consider medical development that involved the use of animals cruel and unacceptable. I believe that the lives of all creatures should be respected and we, humans, have no right to for our own benefits. Governments should invest in developing alternative methods that can replace when doing medical research. For example, a software program can be developed to model a human immune system and new drugs can be tested on the software rather than animals. In this way, no animals will suffer from the medical tests and the society can still benefit from medical development.In conclusion, although it is undoubtedly true that animal testing has helped scientists in drug developments and medical discoveries, I believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused to animals and we should use alternative methods when doing medical research that do not involve animals suffering.This is a great essay. It addresses the two sides of the argument by exploring reasons why animals should and should not be used in medical research. The ideas are well explained and supported by examples.

In my opinion, if the city offers security and green areas, I agree it is a better place to raise the next generation some advantages both sides.Firstly, the countryside in touch with nature, taking care of animals and helping with the gardening. Because of that, they learn how to protect the environment and to live without any technological equipment. Besides that, they have more freedom to play outside the house without any security worries, whereas in the city they are kept at home smartphones and computers for this reason. On the other hand, schools usually have lower quality and it is hard to find extracurricular classes. Therefore, children difficulties trying to develop their abilities besides the school curriculum.However, schools at metropolitan areas tend to have better quality and offer all kinds of activities. Even if there is a sport or an art course that the institution does not offer, it is possible to look for it in another place around the city. As a result, all childrenÃ¢ÂÂs talents and passions can be easier to develop. On the other hand, security, pollution and contact with nature are issues that we have to worry about. The better option would be a city with an excellent quality of life where children could play in parks and gardens.To sum up, growing up in the countryside can be very positive for someoneÃ¢ÂÂs childhood, but the city will usually offer better opportunities for their talentsÃ¢ÂÂ development.This is a well written essay.

    "prompt": "should children grow up in the city or countryside (advantages/disadvantages)?",
    "essay": "Some people think it is better for children to grown up in the city, while others think that life in the countryside is more suitable for them. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both places?Living in the rural area is the best option for children by a group of people, while others believe that cities offer more opportunities. In my opinion, if the city offers security and green areas, I agree it is a better place to raise the next generation some advantages both sides.Firstly, the countryside in touch with nature, taking care of animals and helping with the gardening. Because of that, they learn how to protect the environment and to live without any technological equipment. Besides that, they have more freedom to play outside the house without any security worries, whereas in the city they are kept at home smartphones and computers for this reason. On the other hand, schools usually have lower quality and it is hard to find extracurricular classes. Therefore, children difficulties trying to develop their abilities besides the school curriculum.However, schools at metropolitan areas tend to have better quality and offer all kinds of activities. Even if there is a sport or an art course that the institution does not offer, it is possible to look for it in another place around the city. As a result, all childrenÃ¢ÂÂs talents and passions can be easier to develop. On the other hand, security, pollution and contact with nature are issues that we have to worry about. The better option would be a city with an excellent quality of life where children could play in parks and gardens.To sum up, growing up in the countryside can be very positive for someoneÃ¢ÂÂs childhood, but the city will usually offer better opportunities for their talentsÃ¢ÂÂ development.This is a well written essay.

    "prompt": "should unpaid community work be mandatory in high school (agree/disagree)?",
    "essay": "Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programs (for example working for a charity, improving the neighborhood or teaching sports to younger children). To what extent do you agree or disagree?It is argued that voluntary services charity, cleaning the neighborhood, imparting knowledge to the underprivileged, should be made mandatory in the high school curriculum. I strongly agree as it not only helps in students becoming socially responsible adults but also in shaping their character.Firstly, community service inculcates a sense of responsibility towards the society, something that is needed to shape a good society. For instance, the introduction of Swatch Bharath scheme in my school, The Hyderabad Public School, ten years ago taught me not only to keep the surroundings of the school clean but also to never litter wherever I go. Hence, now I feel responsible to maintain cleanliness everywhere. Such services are needed to develop a better society in the future.Secondly, voluntary services cater to the overall character development of an individual. It a feeling of empathy in children which is needed to build a better character. For example, an alumnus of Montessori High School, who indulged in petty law-breaking activities during school confessed that it was the charity service that he did in high school; which in his mind; him in becoming a better person for his family and refrained him from committing socially irresponsible acts. Thus, such voluntary activities teach us to value what we have and in turn to our personality development.That being said, we cannot deny the fact that many students misuse the time allocated for these services by considering it as an excursion to enjoy with friends rather than a learning .In conclusion, although compulsory voluntary community service has its drawbacks, it is still useful in shaping a child as a socially responsible citizen and also in their overall personality development. Therefore, pupils should be encouraged to involve themselves in such activities.This is a well written essay. It addresses all parts of the task and the arguments and ideas are developed and supported. The information is presented in a logical order and the ideas are linked by appropriate connective words. The use of vocabulary conveys the exact meaning of the writer and there are only minor instances of a word being used somewhat unnaturally.

    "prompt": "Why do criminals commit another offence after being punished?",
    "essay": "Many offenders commit more crimes after serving the first punishment. Why is this happening, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?It is true that some criminals commit crimes again after they have been punished. While there are several reasons for this alarming trend, some effective measures can be taken by governments to tackle this problem.There are two main reasons for re-offenders. Firstly, the prison system can make the situation worse. Criminals put together in prison and they make friends with other offenders. While they are locked up in prison, they do not have much to do there, and they would exchange information about what they have done before they came to the prison or they may plan crimes with other inmates. Secondly, offenders often do not have any other means of earning money. They are poor, uneducated and lacking skills needed to maintain a job. Also, a criminal record makes finding a job difficult as people usually avoid hiring .To solve this problem, governments should focus on rehabilitation of criminals rather than punishment. Above all, prisons need vocational training which inmates to prepare for life outside the prison. They can learn practical skills such as computer programming, car maintenance and graphic design. In this way, they can be hired for a position that requires this certain knowledge and skills. Community service is another way to reform offenders. Rather than being locked up in prison with other inmates, offenders can help society and become useful to their local community, and these activities would eliminate the negative influence that prisons can have.In conclusion, it is true the one of the problems our community; it can be solved by focusing rather than punishment itself.This is a good essay. The requirements of the task statement are covered, the reasoning is logical and presented in a coherent, easy to follow way, the range of vocabulary is wide enough and the writer shows fluency and flexibility.

    "prompt": "Schools should select students by their academic abilities, agree or disagree?",
    "essay": "Some people think that schools should select students according to their academic abilities, while others believe that it is better to have students with different abilities studying together. Discuss both views and state your own opinion.Some people contend that mixed ability classes are more beneficial for childrenÃ¢ÂÂs development than streaming them on the basis of judgement about their academic abilities. However, from my perspective, I disagree with this contention.Admittedly, mixed ability classes provide a better environment for childrenÃ¢ÂÂs all-round development. In such classes, children with different abilities study together and in turn they can learn from one another. From example, a student, who is good at academic study but weak in dancing or painting, can learn how to dance or paint his peers. In this sense, mixed ability classes allow students to develop their abilities in different subjects instead of only academic abilities.Despite the argument above, I believe streaming students brings more benefits to teachers and students. As for teachers, separating children with better academic abilities from others facilitates effective teaching. This practice helps teachers to control their students more conveniently and easily. Compared with mixed ability in which teacher should consider studentsÃ¢ÂÂ differences when they are using teaching methodologies, streaming makes this situation simpler. To be more specific, students are at the same level of academic ability in a class, and in turn teachers can use the same methodologies for them all. In this way, the narrower the spread of ability in the class, the more convenient the teaching can be.On top of this, enables students to learn in an effective way. According to studentsÃ¢ÂÂ different abilities, they are taught in different ways that are more suitable for them. In the top streams, students use more difficult materials, therefore, they can learn more. In sharp contrast, teachers can explain the material more slowly to those in bottom streams. Under this circumstance, students with different academic abilities can study effectively and efficiently.In the final analysis, mixed ability classes are beneficial for studentsÃ¢ÂÂ versatile development, but in my opinion, segregating students based on different academic ability is better for both teachers and students.The writer presented a balanced discussion of the topic, effortlessly delivered in a form of a fluent, well-written IELTS essay.

    "prompt": "Children these days are suffering from obesity, why and how can it be solved?",
    "essay": "Modern children are suffering from the diseases that were once considered to be meant for adults only. Obesity is a major disease prevalent among children. What are its causes and what solutions can be offered?Nowadays, the increasing rate of overweight children and adults is a worldwide health issue. Obesity is a major problem which is increasing day by day in children. There are various reasons behind it. This essay will discuss the causes of obesity and offer some solutions.The first cause of obesity is junk food. It is often seen that mostly children are fond of burgers, pizzas, noodles and . These types of foods are easily available to them in school canteens. Children love to purchase chips, , ice-cream for lunch. Moreover, in this modern era, parents are working and they do not have time to cook at home. Parents often buy dinner for their children instead of preparing food at home. This calorie-rich diet is making children obese. This problem can be solved by teaching children to cook healthy foods for themselves and banning junk foods and fizzy drinks in schools. This diet can be replaced by milk, juice and fruits for lunch.The second cause of obesity is . It is true that the use of computers and television is increasing children. They spend most of their time watching television or playing video games on a computer. This technological advancement has reduced the level of physical activity in this specific age group. This issue can be resolved by encouraging children to do physical exercises. Parents can take their children to park to encourage playing with friends. Furthermore, schools can add sports in their curriculum to maintain physical fitness in their students.To sum up, it is clear that main causes of obesity are unhealthy eating and not enough physical activities. This ailment can be prevented and treated by healthy eating and physical exercises.This is a good essay. There are only a few minor errors that could have been easily prevented by proofreading this essay one last time before submission (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections).

    "prompt": "Children should be engaged in paid work, agree or disagree?",
    "essay": "In many countries children are engaged in different kinds of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?The issue of whether or not children should be engaged in some paid work has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that having some employment experience is conducive to a childÃ¢ÂÂs learning and development, I contend that it would bring harm to the childÃ¢ÂÂs and learning.First of all, a workplace designed for adults normally child-friendly facilities. Desks and chairs are too high for a child; the light switches are installed on the walls unreachable children; also emergency training and facilities such as phones are only provided to adults. Furthermore, various hazards such as polluted air and chemical fumes are still produced in factories and farms. Undoubtedly young people would suffer in such workplaces.Also, children would find it frustrating when they are not properly inducted before starting a job. A child working in a cement factory would feel a setback when he could not get immediate support while struggling with the procedures of recording different raw materials that required by the job. Further, without sufficient support, a childÃ¢ÂÂs misunderstanding or inappropriately communicating with adults would only disappoint him and prevents him from active learning and interacting with other people.To conclude, a childÃ¢ÂÂs paid employment experience would lead to a negative impact on their health and active learning. However, recognizing the importance of childrenÃ¢ÂÂs learning and their awareness of responsibility, it is advisable to encourage them to be involved in some volunteering opportunities where they can meaningfully learn and interact with other people with sufficient care and support in place for such jobs.This is a good essay. There are only a few errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections), but otherwise this work seems worthy of Band 7.5 or 8.

    "prompt": "Should people spend a lot on weddings and birthday parties?",
    "essay": "Some people think that spending a lot on holding wedding parties, birthday parties and other celebrations is just a waste of money. Others, however, think that these are necessary for individuals and the society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Throwing parties can be expensive. While some people do not find these fancy gatherings worth what they cost, others believe such events are important to both individuals and the society.People choose to throw parties for a number of reasons. For starters, they can make better teams. Project kick-off parties are good opportunities to break the ice and help team members to know each other better. Celebrating a victory create a sense of success and belonging. Companies do not see parties as of money and allocate budget to support such events; moreover, they often leave good memories. From our own experiences, we all have happy memories of our birthday parties when we were little. Every family has great photos at family gatherings in their album. In addition, contrary to what some people believe that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually create value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people better experiences.The popularity of parties, however, causes some tension in the society. They are hard on introverted people who find themselves uncomfortable in the crowd. This is a clinic symptom which psychologists call Ã¢ÂÂsocial anxiety disorderÃ¢ÂÂ. There are other ways to celebrate important events that may have greater value for their cost. For instance, companies could send out gifts after successful projects and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.In my opinion, while a party is a form of social event that brings many benefits to individuals and the society, other choices should also be considered, either to cut spending or to relieve the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations.This is a very good essay. Other than minor inaccuracies there are no problems (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Seems to be worth IELTS Band 8.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is not enough. Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills . There are two following reasons to support for my opinion. I refer to the group of people who study from school to university as Ã¢ÂÂgroup AÃ¢ÂÂ and the other group Ã¢ÂÂ as Ã¢ÂÂgroup BÃ¢ÂÂ.Firstly, at school and university, what group A gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. Of course, theory is very , however, you canÃ¢ÂÂt do everything with just theory. You must have experience. This is what group A . Although in the third or fourth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they arenÃ¢ÂÂt trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students canÃ¢ÂÂt accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience.Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies take this cost from group AÃ¢ÂÂs salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, group B members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B gets more benefits absolutely.In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university. That way, not only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to get a good job and have a brilliant future.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and personality is a controversial issue. I personally believe that paid works is harmful for children for several reasons.It is said that children gain valuable experience in the work place. This may be true. However, I would argue that children are mainly employed in jobs that require manual work and are poorly paid. The recent statistics reveal the common tasks that children are assigned to are washing dishes, mopping floors or serving food in restaurants. Meanwhile, this kind of jobs actually provide children with necessary and useful skills to apply in their future .This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child labour that it is an effective method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to them in a real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is yet to come. They may become so preoccupied with the benefits ahead of them such as small salary that they may leave school.Finally, supporters say that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have compassion for their parents. This is true to a certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on children. As children can make money at an early age, they would feel that it is appropriate to spend it on luxury things.In conclusion, I think that parents should take measures to restrict their child from work, otherwise it would have negative consequences to their future.",

    "essay": ". There are two factors that influence their decisions. The first is the kind of customers they aim at. each kind of readers and watchers has its own features. For example, if your customers are almost entirely teenagers, you have to concentrate on something attracting them such as stories, photographs of singer stars, film stars, funny tales, and fashion. It be very silly if you to provide teenagers with economic or news. On the contrary, and politicians may never read news about James Blunt or Keira Knightley. Therefore, what influences news editorsÃ¢ÂÂ decisions the most is the taste of their customers.The second factor is how hot and attractive the news is. Who or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week? The answer is . In the energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for a really news. So that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they may lose their customers. None of editors wants that bleak future.The type of news is also an important consideration. Whether on television or in newspapers, we seem to get more of and become used to bad news. It is harder for us to come across a piece of good news. We canÃ¢ÂÂt deny that bad things happen on Earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more , which means more and more money, using bad news as a magnet. bad news makes us curious. We want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of course, news editors.In my view it would be better if more good news reported. Bad news makes us good news makes us happy. There should an an equal amount of good and bad news. In that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news. Any inequalities between good news and bad news should be avoided. Nowadays we cannot live without news, and for that reason the role of news editors became very important. We should support them, and in turn they should try their best to provide us with useful news, both good and bad.",

A single individual cannot be blamed for the world pollution, however every person should take care of his or her habitat. In addition, it is vital that environmental issues are treated internationally.Lately, many presentations, conferences and international summits are held to deal with waste treatment, recycling, and soil and water contamination. joint efforts and consolidation can only help in the mutual war the ongoing environmental disaster. For instance, governments should offer support to companies and organizations, involved in manufacturing, industry or agriculture in order to find environment-friendly approaches.

For example, always remember to save energy by switching off lamps, computers and everything that we do not use. Our next obligation is to separate waste and throw bulk only in the designated areas. Driving vehicles can also be environment friendly. For example, we have to avoid accelerating the engines too rapidly or using the air conditioning in the country, where it would be better to save energy and simply open the windows.To sum up, environmental problems should be handled by local and international authorities as well as individuals.

In a society dominated by fear and government control, it is foreseen that this penalty will continue .Maybe this is not a simple question.

Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.Despite these positive are lots of negative effects to smoking too. Initially, smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems. Moreover, passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are are three times as likely to start smoking themselves .In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make.

Whether it should be made easier for them to access university education becomes an ongoing concern, which incurs a highly-charged debate.Obviously, higher education opportunities bring about benefits to students in multiple ways. For example, higher education becomes increasingly important to senior high school graduates, partly it determines if they have the competitive edge in the job market, and partly because it is seen as a guarantee of a certain level of the mental ability, from the computer literacy that is required by the most employers to the capacities of acquiring new knowledge the soonest possible which is valued by most .

The brief responsibility of children is learning. They are not old enough to understand what working experiences are. Nevertheless, they can help parents do chores or housework. This will be a much better way for them to become more responsible for . In addition, childhood is one of the most remarkable memories and must not be taken away by forcing them to work.In conclusion, since all children are the great concern of parent and society, they should be allowed to enjoy life and rather than to work. Hence, one must ponder what view is actually appropriate for the sake of the children.",

    "essay": "Traffic accidents are on the rise these days. Most of the accidents injuries or death. Research have found that most of the accidents are caused by inexperienced drivers, for example young drivers.Young drivers tend to be more daring and are unable to avoid a crush when they face one. They tend to be more daring after drinking alcohol at night and this causes them to lose control of the car. Drunk driving will not only risk a personÃ¢ÂÂs own life but may also cause an life to be lost.The government should encourage the driving to conduct driving lessons for drivers for a longer period. This will give them a clear picture about how accidents happen and teach them about the safety of others on the road. Drivers that have been in an accident after drunk driving should be from driving for at least two years and be given driving lessons again.However, for the aged drivers, the government should not only the age limit but also check the capability of the aged drivers for instance eyesight, hearing and other related health conditions to ensure safe driving. It does not mean that an aged person not fit to drive and has a problem with the heart but a young or a middle aged person could also have heart failure these days.To conclude, I feel that to raise the of young drivers not the best solution but to about the problems they may encounter on the road and to ban them from driving if they have caused an accident due to carelessness. As for the drivers, as long as they are capable on the road before a certain age and there are no health issues there shouldnÃ¢ÂÂt be a problem.",

Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.Despite these positive are lots of negative effects to smoking too. Initially, smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems.

In the UK children whose parents are are three times as likely to start smoking themselves .In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make.

As a fan of those competitions, I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity, but only partially, because such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries.First of all, the World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, South and North Korea have football games regularly two nations a chance to understand each other . In the mid of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events. Even if it sounds ridiculous, many South Koreans were quite surprised at that moment when North Koreans shouted and cried during the match.

Through the sports, two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity.On the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse.

For example, higher education becomes increasingly important to senior high school graduates, partly it determines if they have the competitive edge in the job market, and partly because it is seen as a guarantee of a certain level of the mental ability, from the computer literacy that is required by the most employers to the capacities of acquiring new knowledge the soonest possible which is valued by most .

Their daily meals consist of fast food which contains large amounts of fat and salt.

    "essay": "There is currently a contentious argument that using English as an international language will always have more benefits than drawbacks. Despite the use of English, which has been spreading globally, has positive effects on communication in various aspects, I personally believe that the disadvantages of the spread of English will eventually be more significant.\nIt is true that when more and more countries use English as a common language, the advantages of this implementation will outweigh its negative consequences. A classic example of this is that people from any country could communicate to each other in the easier way. This is because there will be no language barrier, preventing people to deliver their messages to others. Furthermore, using English globally tend to have less misunderstanding when communicating. This is exemplified by natives who live in the same country and speak the same language. These people can understand what each other say completely. Therefore, in terms of global perspective, if everyone has conversations in English, misleading communication tend to be less occurred.\nIn spite of the aforementioned positive consequences of the growing use of English, there are also potential drawbacks. A common example of this is the missing of some languages. Languages which are only used by small groups of people tend to fade away due to the fact that the majority of people would pay more attention to English without conserving these languages. In addition, nations that do not apply English as an international language tend to have small global economic growth. This is because most countries in international markets can understand English. Hence, countries whose people are unable to apply English could inevitably have less opportunities to make commercial deals with other countries, having the ability to speak English.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that the spread of English positively affects the way people from different countries communicate to each other and significantly decreases inaccurate information in conversations. Nevertheless, as this development can lead to the lost in other languages and the declining economy of some countries, I totally disagree with the notion that the advantages of the increasing popularity of English will continue to outweigh the disadvantages. This is because I personally think that the aforementioned negative impacts are the two most crucial aspects when using English.",

I strongly agree with this phenomenon.\nTo go into detail, European countries, such as Switzerland, and Belgium are configured with some languages in one country, such as German, French, and Italian. Therefore, English is categorized as a common language in these countries. In addition, the US and European countries have been leading in a variety of fields, such as science, technology, and academic topics. Therefore, some countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and north European countries followed learning English to keep up with technology. Therefore, the number of non-native speakers has widely and drastically increased in Europe to communicate smoothly. As a result, since internet technology has widely spread around the world, Japanese people can search for any kind of information in English more than five times higher than searching for the same information in Japanese. Therefore, learning English is inevitable for Japanese people, as well as other Asian countries or developing countries.\nFortunately, thanks to recent technology, it is getting easier to study English. For example, online English lessons, such as Cambly allows us to learn English 24/7. In addition, in some social media, the name of an app \"Club House\" is a convenient app to have a conversation with the same users worldwide. Therefore, we can easily share cultural differences and tips to improve our English skill.\nIn contrast, some people are concerned about their own native language might be vanished in the future. In Iceland, although there is a native language, \"Icelandish\" language still remains and is spoken in Iceland, but some people are anxious the language's complex grammar and vocabulary are difficult to explain in some detail. According to the researcher, they are astonished young students are all hanging out only in English, instead of Icelandish. Therefore, the government has been making an effort to maintain the native language by taking advantage of national Media such as, podcast, radio, TV broadcast are only spoken in Icelandish language.\nFinally, thanks to English language, more people are willing to communicate with a lot of people who speak English. This phenomenon is not only convenient to understand cultural differences, but also helpful to learn a variety of subject in English for developing countries, like in the Philipinnes. Tagalogue language is limited to cover some vocabulary to learn academic subjects.\nIn conclusion, English will continuously spread worldwide.",

    "essay": "Some countries and culture already utilize insects as part of food source. As such, it can be relatively inexpensive to consume insects - which are often freely found in certain environments and do not take much skill to be collected, killed and consumed - as compared to the cost and manual labor involved in raising animal livestock, butchering, as well as preparing the meat for consumption. Similarly agriculture also involves consistent manual labor, and has costs associated with it, including for machinery and materials needed. However, people may be against the idea of consuming insects due to the novelty of it, and they may also feel disgust around it. As the prompt states, some may find it unhealthy. Harvesting insects on purpose will also require some physical and psychological work - but the benefit here is that it may be easier than harvesting large animals or cultivating crops.\nI have never consumed an insect product - and my father has mentioned to me that had lived in such-and-such country, I would not be so scared of cockroaches - viewing them as a food source. He intended this to be an ironic comment, meant to comfor me somewhat due to my strong aversion to cockroaches. However, he may be correct! For individuals socialized in such a society, their aversion to roaches may be lower than mine. Hence, part of the issue here is socialization and accepting this new food norm, should it be novel to the individual and/or the country.\nI have tried an octopus for the first time when I was around 20 years old - as I was curious about this dish called Takoyaki, and had heard good reviews of it. It was not unpleasant to eat the ocotpus, per se, but I likely will not go back to it. All in all, new experiences, including consumption of new types of food, may create strong aversion at first, but once dip your toes into it, so to speak, it may be tamer than the experience you were expecting - even if you never go back to eating it again.",

    "essay": "Food is one of the the most essential need for human beings. As the world population continues to grow rapidly, members of society have expressed concerns over food supplies and demand. A huge percentage of the world population are experiencing starvation and nutrients deficiency. In order to solve world hunger issues, providing edible insects as an option for food could be a feasible solution.\nChicken, beef, fishes, are some of the most common food products in the current days. There are thorough and informative research on them to ensure people are consuming them consciously. On the other hand, the same couldn't be said about insects. A large group of people seem to believe that they are an unhealthy food option. This could be due to the the insect habitats, which may seem unsanitary compared to other sources of protein. Furthermore, harvesting insects may negatively affect nature. Although small, they are a significant part of the ecosystem. Making insects a food option would decrease their numbers which could create crucial changes that we are not prepared for.\nHowever, using edible insects as a food option would help to provide a bigger and wider range of choices for the world population. As the population grows, it is only logical to also increase the food supply. Furthermore, there are countries across the globe with high willingness to try insects as a food option. If we utilize this data accordingly, we may be able to provide an additional option to countries that would like to try them.\nIn conclusion, people in many parts of the world are not ready to consume edible insects. In my opinion, raising awareness on reducing meat consumerism may be easier and a more feasible solution to the problem. It is evident that our societies need more research on insects as food product.",

    "essay": "As the world has been experiencing rapidly aging population, the issue of providing proper care for the elderly is concerning the society. However, I am inclined to believe that the increase of elderly people will be under control. While many challenges are likely to taken place, there will be effective ways to manage this civil segment with the cooperation of both government and private sectors.\nAs the elderly population is expanding, the demand for nursing homes or eldersÃ¢ÂÂ clubs are on the increase. To meet this demand, private sectors are investing on this type of institutions and services as they foresee the lucrative profit these businesses can probably generate in the near future. Apparently, young people are occupied with their daily job which makes it impossible to take care of their parents or grandparents. Therefore, sending the elderly to nursing homes or hiring personal care service are reasonable options to be consider.\nAnother reason to validate my opinion is the balance in labor force. While some developed countries are experiencing aging population, the scenario is opposite in developing countries whose birth rate is considerably high. As a result, many developed countries such as Germany have encouraged a welcoming entry of those young laborers into its nursing industry. One of my friend has been settling in Germany following her moving to the country 5 years ago to become a nursing staff in privately-owned elderly clubs.\nLast but not least, government interference in elderly care is highly recommended. It is suggested that the government allocate more budget to establish publicly-owned elderly homes to mitigate the financial burden to acquire this service. Moreover, regulations on pension plan should be properly adjusted and taken more seriously by employers so that people are assured financially when they are retire.\nIn conclusion, I believe the elderly problem is likely to be handled well if there are joint effort of both private and public sectors in creating healthcare system and human resource management.",

    "essay": "In our modern society and the development and improvement of health care sector, the average expected life age has increased comparing to what it was like in the past. This as good as it is, aslo raised the cncern of tkaing care of elderly people. In my opinion, I believe that the ability to deal with this concern depends on two main factors, which are the degree of country developement as well as the society characteristics.\nFirst of all, to be able to take care of elderly people, the relevant orginizations and innstitutions should be in place. However, this condition most of the time cannot be found in under-developed countires. That is because of the lack of funding resources. On the other hand, more developed countries, such as The Netherlands, Norway, and other european countires, are more capable of taking care of elderly. That is because they have the enough resources to fund such non-profitable orginizations.\nNevertheless, other factor that must be taken into account, is the society characteristcs. Here we mean, wheather the society is considered individualist or socialist. In social societies, countries do not need to allocate a lot of resources on elderly care, because this role is already taken by families. Where in individualist societies, most of the times elder people will be living alone. Therefore, when they reach the point where they cannot take care of themselves, they will go to elderly care houses.\nTo summarize, the ability to taking care of elderly people depends on two main factors, the country developement and the society type. If the country is developed or the society is considered social, taking care of the mental and physical health of elderly people will be eaiser. In contrast, if the country institutions are under-developed or the society is considered individualist, taking care of eldery people will be much harder.",

    "essay": "While it is considered by some that young pupils should not be handed out assignments by their teachers, others strongly believe they are crucial for educational purposes. I completely agree that assigned homework can put unhealthy stress on children. However, there is one significant benefit of giving young school children homework in moderation, provided that they are not assessed traditionally as they are today.\nIn regards to giving children a redundant amount of homework, there are some drawbacks to consider. Many people, especially parents, are worried for their childrens quality of life when they are expected to perform outside of school classes. This can be because some children show a range of symptoms connected to performance anxiety, which might be caused by their own expectations of achieving certain grades. Since they are taught on an everyday basis that they have to perform on a high level at school, in order to satisfy the teacher, they are at risk of not experiencing the positive aspects of being a child.\nBy contrast, many other adults argue that home assignments plays a vital role in childrensÃÂ´ life, so they are adequately educated from an early stage. The significant advantage of implementing homework in elementary school is that pupils will learn study strategies and be able to familiarise themselves with the concept, before the homework becomes more difficult as they get older. If they would not be handed out homework tasks at all, they may find themselves in a situation where they are not able to keep up the pace.\nIn conclusion, while I strongly agree that putting a immense amount of pressure on young school children by grading their works is contraproductive, I think home assignments are necessary to give children an opportunity to adjust to how school works in real life. In other words, teachers should not grade childrens homework to release some of their pressure, instead they should assess tasks by speaking about their weaknesses only.",

This in other terms lead to an good export and import trading.

Other important factor is sports, by participating in worldcups, and olympics will also make a valuable progress by being recognized world-wide may lead to many opportunities.

This could be ture to some extent, but I do not agree compeletely with this openion.\nOne of the biggest health concern could come form air polutions, as big cities likely to have heavy trafics, especially in the third would coutries. However, in the developed coutries, many cities have as same amonut of trafics as suburban areas, or evern less. For example, many big cities in developed coutries charges a lot for parkings.

    "essay": "In the past decades, the rise of urbanization has brought trends of moving into the cities. While some people believe that the availability of resources and welfare in metropolises can outweigh the unhealthy environment, I strongly believe that the fancy infrastructures come in exchange for health sacrifice.\nTo begin with, most megacities are overpopulated. With scarce resources and higher demands in every aspect, products and services received in these bustling locations usually come at a higher price, lower quality and longer waiting time. For example, it could take up to weeks or months to queue up for non-urgent medical services while it takes only a few days or even without booking in non-busy areas. Moreover, the nature of crowded areas accelerates the spreading of transmittable diseases during the pandemic.\nAnother undeniable health factor for those residing in cities is pollution. Most cities come with traffic issues where there are exceeding amounts of cars which create air pollution. It is proved that, in long term, smog in the air could result in respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. Furthermore, the number of the city's population is equal to the extremely large amount of waste and without an appropriate waste management system, it could lead to several more problems. One of them is pests such as mice and bugs which are the perfect mediums for severe diseases such as rabies.\nAll in all, urbanization has tremendous benefits to human society as a whole and is unavoidable in the present context. Thus, governments should focus on addressing these issues to ensure the sustainable progress of cities and the citizens' quality of life.",

However, some people consider that the life in big cities is generally hazardous for the health of people. In my opinion, although big cities provide many amenities to the people but the city life is not good for a person when it comes to health.\nThe main reason is continuous increase in population. Metropolitan cities attract people from small towns and/or villages in search of better opportunities, good education for their children or medical facilities. This migration makes these cities overcrowded. As population increases, there will be many vehicles on roads. More traffic will lead to more air and noise pollution. Likewise, as the population increases, the demand for housing also will escalate. To fulfill the demand of housing, local government has to reduce the green space to built more buildings in the city which will lead to more pollution. Obviously, pollution causes many health issues.\nAnother reason is stressful and busy life in the big cities. People working in big MNC companies in the cities, have deadlines to complete their work. If they are not able to meet the deadlines, it will affect their growth in the company. People in metropolitan cities are so busy that they don't have time to take care of their health. Living in a continuous stress without taking care of the health leads to many health problems.\nTo conclude, the life in a big city is very stressful, busy and surrounded with a lot of pollution, which is not good for health of an individual.",

    "essay": "Never has the topic concerning citizensÃ¢ÂÂ health failed to attract peopleÃ¢ÂÂs attention. However, when it comes to whether living in a metropolis would do bad to peopleÃ¢ÂÂs health, individuals hold different views. As far as I am concerned, it does diminish individualsÃ¢ÂÂ health conditions.\nUndoubtedly, living in a metropolis has some benefits for the inhabitantsÃ¢ÂÂ health. A big city is more likely to provide individuals with high level medical services which can be helpful when people are afflicted with various diseases. Precisely, there are numerous community clinics as well as large hospitals where individuals can get access to offering people the most advanced medical technology and medicines. Thus, greater recovering possibilities are provided by big cities for sick people.\nHowever, urban life can also be unhealthy due to numerous reasons. Firstly, individuals tend to suffer from greater mental stress in a metropolis. Specifically, the increasingly higher housing price contributes to the heavy financial burdens of individuals. People are compelled to struggle with high-intensity works due to the high cost in housing, which would cause a high mental pressure. Besides, one of the reasons for individualsÃ¢ÂÂ mental pressure can be the indifferent relationship among urban inhabitants which is caused by the lack of a sense of community.\nFurthermore, the poor air condition which is caused by the remorseless rush of pollution in big cities does do harm to citizensÃ¢ÂÂ health conditions. For instance, the waste gas that discharged by the cars in the streets and the factories is polluting the air in urban areas, leading to a higher rate in diseases. As a result, citizensÃ¢ÂÂ health conditions can be diminished physically.\nIn conclusion, although a metropolis can provide advanced medical services to urban inhabitants, living in big cities can also be hazardous to individualsÃ¢ÂÂ mental heath and body health due to numerous factors. In my opinion, living in a metropolis is more likely to undermine peopleÃ¢ÂÂs health.",

    "essay": "There has been a lively discussion revolving around the megapolice influence on human health, as some people presume living in large cities results in a variety of problems. In my humble opinion, I consider big-city life to be harmful.\nA row of arguments can prove this point of view. The air and water pollution in cities tend to provoke a spectrum of lung and skin diseases. A number of people encountering lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, eczema and psoriasis prevails in megapolicies compared to small towns and villages. Even I have acquired chronic bronchitis while leaving in Moscow. It also must be mentioned that constant contamination of enviroment has long-term consequence for human genetics. For instance, several decades ago the phenomena of allergy was not so widespread. And nowadays, several hundred thousands of people are suffering from it, as their immune system responds inadequately to ordinary things, such as animal fur or dust.\nOn the contrary, the medicine level in small villages cannot be compared with medicine in large cities. Some urgent problems such as limb break, infection, serious inflammation, heart attack, seizures or appendicits can be tackled only in large cities, where you can call an ambulance and it will come in a blink of an eye, while in countyside it can cause a dramatical outcome. My friend's grandpa in a distant village broke a rib and it stabbed his lung, and, unfortunately, ambulance did not make it in time.\nTo sum up, living in megapolice can possibly extend your life, but for me the quality of this life is still doubtful.",

    "essay": "Despite to the presence of vast amount of translation programs on computers and other electronic devices, it is still considered more beneficial in terms of learning language itself. In this essay, I will be describing my total agreement with this dilemma.\nThe utmost reason for learning new language instead of using various programs is that human brain makes necessary changes in its structure and produces necessary chemical substances which in turn gives other functions to the brain. As a result of this human brain gains new functions in addition to the language skills.\nAnother benefit coming from directly learning language is the opportunity to express your beliefs and emotions in that language which is impossible to realize via software programs. People around the speaker tend to understand the spoken language more easily and get the speaker's ultimate goal in a more usual and humane way.\nThe third reason for studying the language rather than carrying a software to translate might be the possibility of immediately using language. In other words, software programs can not find the right words according to the situations or conversations among people. As a consequence of this, due to different meanings which translation devices remain useless in such cases, huge misunderstandings can occur.\nIn a conclusion, in addition to the reasons mentioned above, using language by learning it always seems realiable and more realistic way than using device for this purpose. As I raised my pure opinion toward gaining language skill earlier I strongly believe that this method has been the most preferable method for decades and it will be.",

    "essay": "Some people claim that language knowledge has still benefited inspite of appearance of applications and websites providing translation in real time. Modern special software is able to give quite quality translation into different languages, and it seems that it will soon replace the translators and will get rid of necessity to learn new languages. However, in my opinion, there are still some essential advantages to know foreign languages.\nFirst of all, any language is so complicated and constantly changing system that it is impossible to automized translation process to keep all senses. For instance, if you interlocutor creates a joke based on words game, it will unlikely recognise by AI. Thus, it is too hard to teach a computer to uderstand all meanings that you want to provide.\nAnother important aspect of learning languages is knowing new cultures. Language is the great source for understanding other nations and countries. If you use online translator, you will never know the origine of some idioms or phrases that contain culture code.\nMoreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. It helps to develop memory and imagination. For instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.\nFinally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. Then online translators are not available. But if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.\nTo sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress. Although artificial intelligence is able to translate everything you want, it is crucial to continue learning languages in order to understand all sense and meanings in conversation with foreigners, to know new cultures and understand their peculiarities and, of course, to make your brain work.",

    "essay": "Despite several translation programmes exist on different platforms, studying and acquiring the essential rules of a language has more benefits. Owing to limited usefulness of translation softwares in daily life, to large extent, ÃÂ± agree with this statement. However, educationalists may use these programmes as supporting management systems for academical purposes.\nA growing number of softwares are available on online platforms to help people for translating documents or improve their language skills. Individuals from different sociocultural or educational levels frequently utilise these open-access and easily understandable operating systems. Moreover, some teachers recommend their use to promote the learning process of primary school pupils. Last but not least, because translating a sheet by using these programmes is less time-consuming and free of charge, its use is gaining popularity among young individuals with regard to academic communication and correspondence.\nOn the other hand, the utility of these file management systems are questioned by some experts in the field of philology. Some linguistic scientists stated that translation supporting systems distracts childrenÃ¢ÂÂs motivation and eagerness to learn the grammatical rules of a language. Additionally, while these operating tools have benefits in terms of easening the written communication, it has no practical advantage or use in verbal interaction. From my point of view, softwares should not be introduced to children before learning basics of a language and gaining an intermedicate level of spoken and written vocabulary.\nIn conclusion, although translation softwares have limited benefits such as costeffectivity and usability, it should be restricted as a complementary tool for people with a significant background and knowledge of a language, and the advantages of learning a language including practicality in face to face communication clearly outweighs.",

    "essay": "In reality, translation softwares makes a lot of people's lives easier when communicating with others that don't speak the same language. However, in my opinion, learning a new language might be more advantageous than using this software.\nFirst of all, the process of learning new languages involves the ability to correspond words in two different dialects, which also requires using a lot of parts of our brain. Therefore, this process improves certain areas of our neurologic system, specifically, the left hemisphere, responsible for communication and speech.\nIn fact, multiple studies have shown that people that speak different idioms have a lower risk of neurologic diseases such as Alzheimer's and Dementia since the left side of the brain is more developed than others that might only know one language.\nFurthermore, these types of software are not always accurate. In spite of being correct the majority of the time, there are some situations where the translation is wrong because of different factors.\nOne of them is that there's no translation for certain words in other languages, for example, \"Saudade\" in Portuguese has no correspondence in English.\nBesides that, when using Google Translate one has to pay attention to the translation given in certain languages. In reality, when translating from English to Portuguese, sometimes the programme doesn't consider the fact that in Portuguese adjectives come after the noun while in English they came before.\nLastly, someone that chooses to use this type of system to communicate with someone, instead of learning that language loses a bigger amount of time than others that already speak that dialect. That is because one has to first record what the person is saying then tell the software their answer and wait for it to be translated to the other. This results in a quite complicated setting that might be aggravated in situations where the translator doesn't understand one of the persons involved in the conversation.\nTo illustrate this, when talking to the AI \"Siri\" on the iPhone or \"Alexa\" on Google, a lot of the time they don't comprehend what we are saying, which results in people having to repeat themselves several times.\nIn conclusion, I believe that learning a new language is easier than using a translation software. In fact, this not only boosts our knowledge but also avoids difficult situations where what people are trying to say is wrongly translated.",

    "essay": "Translation softwares are a convenience that we see popping up more and more around us these days. I have seen these being used in daily life around me even very recently. For example, I was recently at the airport to travel from the east coast to the west coast of the US. While there, a passenger in line before me at the luggage drop off had his phone out and was talking to the attendants using his phone. On paying closer attention I realized, he was using a translation software to understand what they said and to respond back to them. It took some effort on both sides, but in the end, it worked!\nThis is a real-life example of translation software making peoples' lives easier on a regular basis. Witnessing this got me thinking - what would have happened in the absence of this service being available literally on the tips of our fingers. In the absence of this easy access to technology as we have today however, it has come down to one thing - the human capacity to learn and communicate in more than one language.\nComing from a multicultural background where none of my neighbors spoke the same language as me, it was inevitable that I would be exposed to multiple languages since childhood. This is a reality for most metropolitan cities around the world. When I was three years old and could communicate to some degree in my mother tongue or native language, my father ensured I also learned another one of our National languages that was prevalent in the region. By the time I was six-seven years old, I could conveniently speak in two languages. Meanwhile, in school, I was being exposed to the English alphabet in addition to the two other languages which made it easy to learn and understand English too. I can categorically say that knowing all three languages made my life infinitely easier for me since we moved around a lot due to my father's work arrangements.\nLater on, during my college days, I met my best friend of eighteen years and was exposed to her native language or mother tongue and since then have picked up a passing knowledge of the language as well. The movies and plays around us while young used multiple languages too and as a result I have a passing knowledge of six languages today. This knowledge not only makes communicating a breeze for me in most areas in my country, it keeps my brain active.\nIn conclusion, I believe while translation softwares definitely make life easier for us on different occasions, being bilingual, trilingual, or a polyglot serves to make life interesting and easy at the same time. Truly understanding and speaking a language brings to light so many nuanced facets of an entire culture surrounding the language which cannot be translated through a translation software. It has been proven that learning multiple languages helps keep the human brain adaptable and flexible - all marks of a young and active mind. From my personal experiences, I believe that the translation softwares serve as a quick solution to the language barrier for people in general, learning a language brings in a level of richness to ones experience of life as a whole. Translations softwares should therefore not be considered as a replacement for learning a language but as an aide to learning a new skill.",

For example, working in the same company for many years not only make a sustainable income but also become more expert in this working field.

It is the kind of sport I never play in my life, I am not only got a new way of enjoyment of this sport, but also bring me to know a ton of new quality friends I got from the golf society. This event can lift my life quality to another level I did not expected before.\nIn summary, I would say that the advantage of doing new things outweigh the disadvantage of its.

Cause of, the most important feature of life is to be happy.\nOn the other hand, the human nature is to evolve. I think, adaptation to his own environment is crucial for deal with the recents climate. Moreover, if we stop to learn new behaviour, we could not be able to adapt sharply for the global warming. For example, one solution about the global warming is to learn news behaviours and habits. That can help to reduce smog and, as we know, our brain are plastic, but if we do not use it, it will stop to work.\nTo conclude, to change is important because in our century we have big issues.

So they rather stay in that place because they're too afraid to lose it and end up worse. I believe that this is an understandable and common reason around people, however i believe that change can give more chances for improvement.\nOther people believes that change is always a positive thing. Changing is an opportunity to grow and discover new things, It's a chance to achieve something better and improve. There are people who doesn't like to be in the same place (phisically, economically or emotionally) and prefer changing. For instance, going to a new country because the idea of living in the same place forever is not charming enough, so find out new places to see, and places to feel confortable ,emotionally and economically for instance, is something that only people who are hungry enough of change would do it. I believe that sometime it's better risk it than live the same life everyday.\nIn conclusion, the preference about change depends on people and wheter is beneficial or not depends on the different point of views and situations. I think, that change is important, everything change even if try to avoid it. So, it's better embrace it because no matter how things go it will leave you either with an experiece or with a lesson. So, in my opinion change is a good thing.",

This essay will descraibe both saids and draw my personal conclusion.\nFirst of all, when we live on same schudale for all days that mean the tommorw we know what we do.

Students of today are the proffessionals of tomorrow and thus is very important they recibe a propper education. In my opinion we should divide students based on their academic ability.\nIf we educate all students together regarthless of their different academic abilities we will be making a hughe mistake. Students with higher capacities will not be adressed in a propper way and it will discourage them. Smart students tend to get bored very fast and therefore special attention must be pay to them.\nOn the contrary, if we educate students based on their academic abilities we will not only see better results in the smarter ones, but we will also take better care of the students with more learning difficulties. By using this method the needs of the students will be adressed in a better way.\nEducation should have an indiviudal focus or at least in different groups, taking academic abilities degrees in account.\nIn my personal expirience I shared classrooms with students that had special needs and teachers educate them in different ways than the rest of as. These special students have different learning times and needed more atenttion from their teachers. On the other hand, some students were very smart with great academic abilities and some of them had some behaviour troubles becouse they got bored at class, I remmember one student named Jackson Bell who was brilliant and was sent to the school physicologist due to behaviour problems(he hit other students) and if teachers have gaived Jackson the extra attention he needed that wouldnÃÂ´t happen.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, a topic often discussed is the education and its relation with the difference in people's ability and possibilities. According to some, it should be better to separate students based on their academic skills, while others believe that a valid education can be transmitted without discriminating people based on their ability.\nPeople that support the separation of students believe that an omogeneous group can learn better and faster. Indeed, if someone has less skills compared to the others component of the group, teachers have two possibilities. First, to lower the level of the lessons in order to allow a catch up. Second, leave behind the student wiht low ability. Both solutions are not optimals. Thus, if we put together students with similar capabilities, we can make the process of learing more efficent for both groups.\nThe other vision is to educate students all together. By doing so, you can encourage low skills students to engage theirselves to catch up with the most brilliant one. Moreover, if you split the group, students with less capabilities can develop self-estimation problems and so, they will think that they can not be in the \"best\" group. Another good point for educate all students together is that people with higher ability will help their classmates. However, the level of the class will be probably lower.\nTo conclude, I think that the best solution depends on the purpose of the educator and on the age of students. Indeed, it is very differet the education of children or teenagers. For example, if you want to create the future class of engineers, you should divide students based on their academic ability. But if you want to educate people as humankind you should not divide the class.",

    "essay": "Some people argue that students who have noticeable abilities and nice educational skills in academics should be separated during the learning process. The other says that it is no object who a better in education who not they should study together. I believe that it is terrible idea to include separation among students.\nOn the one hand, when students with strong and weak academic abilities educate separately, teachers could control the learning process more thoroughly. In this way the teacher could give them more difficult tasks and focus on really relevant topics. A good example of this are private schools with fees and entering exams. It is the fact that there students in final classes have better knowledge than in common schools.\nOn the other hand, when students with different skills educate together the strong students will help weak ones. In these classes there are standards and all students should follow them and there are opportunities to ask schoolmates how to solve some task correctly. The nice example of this is my school. If I did not know how to solve a task I would have a chance to wait for help from my more wise mate.\nIn conclusion, although separate education will give a chance to learn a lot of difficult tasks and it helps teachers, the losing way of asking help if you do not know how to solve the task would be devastating for the educational process. In addition, it could be separated by abilities and wisdom, anyway it is an awful idea.",

    "essay": "I believe students should be divided according to their academic ability this is because specific students require different amounts of support according to their abilities.\nStudents that are divided based upon their academic ability are more likely to learn specific parts of their subjects. This will help students not only to learn more but also help them gain more confidence so that they can believe in themselves and so that they are more likely to understand the information required by their subject as they are recieving extra help.\nHowever if students are divided according to their academic ability they are more likely to feel bored as they may not have their peers to interact with and there's also a high chance that the students may feel isolated as they believe they feel like they do not have the knowledge requirements for their subjects which can demotivate the students and further leading to poor grades.\nIf students are educated together they can feel like that their not left out and they can help recieve information from their peers which can help them further understand the subject.\nHowever if the students are educated together there's a high chance that they are more likely to be distracted by their peers and they would be less focused on their subjects which can lead too poor grades. Morever if students are educated together there's also a chance that specific students may not understand what the teacher is teaching or talking about as diffrerent students have different understandings and academic abilities.\nOverall I believe students should be divided according to their academic abilities this is because students are more likely to understand the information provided by their teachers as they are provided with additional support and students should be more mature enought to undertsand that if they do not meet specific academic requirements they should not be demotivated, they should understand how to handle the situation and show that they can be courageous enough to do even better as the students are provided with additional support.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, people hold different ideas about how to distribute students at schools. Some individuals argue that minors should be taught separately based on their academic performance, whereas others state that they ought to be educated together. This essay will discuss both viewpoints, although it is my opinion that it is better to allocate students together regardless of their capabilities.\nProponents of the idea of dividing children at different levels argue that the selection can better facilitate an efficient and productive learning environment for different students. More specifically, by doing so, schools can provide specific objectives to meet studentsÃ¢ÂÂ needs as young people have distinctiveness in learning preferences, personalities, and interests. Therefore, through selecting and separating the youth into a range of classes based on their talents and intelligence, schools cannot only tailor a result-oriented syllabus to explore each studentÃ¢ÂÂs maximum potential but also improve the quality of education since excellent students can learn in a fast way without anyone being left behind. In contrast, ordinary students can still keep up with the majority with complete comprehension. Furthermore, this can also minimise the possible pressure that some academically challenged students suffer from the negative psychological impacts, considering their poor performance in the exams or assignments.\nOthers, however, who point out that mixed classes attach great importance to the contribution of healthy competition and collaboration, also make valid arguments. Despite the possible imbalance in each studentÃ¢ÂÂs academic performance in a class, superior peers can serve as a desirable role models to others. Their strengths, such as learning attitudes and methods, can enlighten the rest of the class to improve and study. In addition, the diversity in class can promote mutual study among children with different abilities and create a better environment for childrenÃ¢ÂÂs all-rounded development. Since the way of streaming students has been proven effective and practical, this mode of teaching is highly advisable by educational experts, and there are still many schools following this norm to educate children rather than set them apart as many students who are not excellent at study may experience disappointment and a lack of confidence when compared to those straight-A students in separated classrooms.\nIn conclusion, although the teaching resources can be assigned more precisely to target youngstersÃ¢ÂÂ gifts in the streaming, it is still too early and unfair at this stage. Therefore, I believe it is better to mix students with different levels of abilities in a dynamic and harmonious class, and undoubtedly, we should never discriminate unfairly against students who should be highly encouraged instead.",

    "essay": "There are a lot of different opinions regarding the teaching of children and what is best for a childs developement. Although some people believe that homeschooling is the best teaching method for the developement of children, most people are of the opinion that it is essential for children to go to school.\nThe most popular of the two opinons is that it is important for children to attend school. The main reason that people believe this, is because socialization with other children in school is viewed as being essential for the cognitive and social developement of children. The advantages of children attending school therefore consists of an improved social life with more friends their own age. This can help young children figure out how to navigate social situations better and improve their own self-image by receiving confirmation from their peers. Although there are a lot of advantages for children attending school, there are also a lot of disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that children don't get to spend a lot of time with their family. This can decrease the influence that parents have on their children in the long term and inable their ability to raise their children according to their own values.\nThe other less popular opinion is that it is better to teach your children at home rather than to send them off to school. The main reason that some people believe this, is because these parents are concerned that outside influences have the ability to disturb their childrens upbringing. The greatest advantage of homeschooling is that it promotes a better nuclear family and provides parents with more control concerning their childs upbringing. However, this schooling method comes with some disadvantages too, since childrens social developement can be hindered due to inatequate social interactions with children their own age.\nIn conclusion, I believe that it is best for childrens developement to be taught at school, rather than parents teaching their children at home. I hold this opinion since school attendance can enhance childrens social skills and their ability to navigate the world around them.",

    "essay": "There is no agreement between supporters of the school and home education. While there are strong arguments in favour of teaching children at home, I still believe positive sides of going to school outweigh the opposite view.\nOn the one hand, there are obvious arguments why some people may prefer to teach their children at home. Children safety is the most common reason. Everyday way to and from school is a persistent danger for the younger generation as thousands of children become victims of the road accidents every year. Some other safety concerns include negligence of the teachers, while being stretched by the dozens of students, and criminal incidents such as mass shootings that are not so rare in the recent few years.\nOn the other hand, attendance of school provides learners with some essential social skills and help them to benchmark themselves versus their peers and subsequently to move forward. Interaction with people, work together on something and even competition in some aspects are key for future adjustment to the adult life. The recent study suggests that those primary school students that had started their education before the outbreak of the covid are on average show better results on various tests. Furthermore, education in the school tends to motivate most of the children via competition within the group.\nIn conclusion, there could be different opinions on whether teaching children at home is better than school education as there are certain advantages and drawbacks. I strongly believe that school education brings more benefits and couldn't be equally replaced by study at home",

    "essay": "The topic of gay marriage merely failed to be discussed. However, when it comes to whether gay marriage should be allowed legally, individuals hold divergent views. As far as I am concerned, the government should treat gay marriage as a legal thing.\nUndoubtedly, gay marriage can be beneficial. First of all, it is able to shrink the disparity between the affluent and the impoverished. For instance, some countries which allow gay marriage legally have become well-known tourism sites now by attracting foreign gays to come. Thus, their tourism industry can be thrived and the moribund local economy can be turned into the resurgent one, which may help to avoid turning the gap into gulf. Additionally, allowing gay marriage to be legal is also able to undermine the crime rate. On condition that some gays cannot enjoy the right of marriage, they may feel underrated, underprivileged and underappreciated, which may give them the predisposition to revenge the society to express their resentment and dissatisfaction. What is more, the government is able to diminish cultural conflict through making gay marriage a law. Provided that some individuals get little acquainted with gay culture, they may deem it as aggressive. However, by admitting it as a low, we can minimize such vulnerability and promote the mutual understanding of divergent cultures.\nOn the other hand, treating gay marriage legally also has various disadvantages. Firstly, it may undermine family rapport for the reason that some family members may not willing to accept gay marriage, which may cause the increasingly indifferent among family members and finally lead to family skirmish and splintering. In addition, some young individuals are possible to make mistakes at an early age if the government makes gay marriage law. It is widely acknowledged that some young people are not mature enough to choose the right partner. Provided that they get married at an early age, they may suffer irreversible loss.\nTo sum up, although there are some disadvantages to let gay marriage be legal, the benefits of it are multifaceted. Considering the development of the economy and culture, I agree with allowing gay marriage to be a legal option.",

    "essay": "Some people argue that gay marriage it is a trend that might negatively affect society. Controversially, some others believe that same-sex marriages are natural and people have the right to choose this kind of marriage. This essay discusses why gay marriage should not be defined as a trend but regarded as a people's right, thus as a legal marriage.\nDuring the last few years, several arguments arose against or in favour of same-sex marriage. For decades, people believed that gay people should not be allowed to get married as it was considered against the traditional image of a family. For example, same-sex people wouldn't be able to love and care for a child as a traditional family could. The belief behind this thought is related to the patriarchal educational concept where a child needs to grow in the presence of a mother and a father. Thus, same-sex relations are considered not natural by some people. Considering the definition of love and what caring for someone involves in, isn't indicated that same-sex people cannot feel and express love to each other and care for someone. Love is a feeling that goes beyond the gender. As such, people have the right to love and get married.\n,\nhence, due to the presence of such a patriarchal belief in most of the world's countries, gay marriage isn't a legal right yet. In a world where people express the need to be more democratic, politically correct and free from biases and discrimination, same-sex marriage should be globally legalised. As such, a change of mindset might be needed. for example, people should begin to see marriage as an expression of love rather than a right and moral action to procreate.\nTo sum up, while for some people same-sex marriage is only a trend that should could impact the society, for some others, gay marriage it is a natural expression of love. Thus, marriage should be allowed regardless the gender and people's sexual-orientation. govemrnts. should support and legalised same-sex marriage.",

    "essay": "Thanks to the modern society, people feel free to behave more naturally than before, without the necessity of hiding aspects of their personal life, such as the sexual orientation. For that reason, the number of omosexual women and men seems to increas and some people are worried about the impact that this could have on the society. In my opinion, the government should not interfere with this topic and, consequently, gay marriage should be legally allowed.\nNowadays, being a omosexual couple is difficult because the society does not recognise them the same rights of an eterosexual couple, such as the possibility to adopt children or to share goods. As human beings, gay women and men should have the same opportunities and rights of every other people. Hence, they should be allowed to legally marry and live their life as a normal one.\nFurthermore, I think that gay couples do not affect the wellness of the society in any way. Indeed, even if people believe that the only possible family is the traditional one, it is not true and other kind of family does exist. Many children grow up by people of the same sex and this does not affect their education or influence their thought. For that reason, different type of family should be recognised.\nConsidering the above point, I think that people should have the right to choose from their own who to share their life with, without any legal restriction. In order to allow that, the governement should legalize the marriage between gay couples.",

    "essay": "The scenario of two people getting married was always welcomed in society but not if those two are of the same sex. This question remains quite arguable currently. A part of the population tends to have the opinion that gay marriage could affect the community in a destructive way, while the other part sees this perspective as the development of social nature, freedoms, and basic human rights. I believe that every individual person has the own will to decide for themselves who they want to marry, overall, other people are not the ones to make a decision.\nFirst of all, it is widely recognized that conservative and religious societies have a low tolerance for gay marriage because it can destroy their core values and outlook in life. It is generally known that such people think that the legalization of gay marriage can lead to the devaluation of heterosexual couples and their marriage, which is extremely harmful to the community. For example, there is one opinion widely spread in Utah that such legalization can devalue heterosexual marriage, which will lead to an active extramarital sex life, and therefore to a wild increase in the number of abortions. So, it is clear that gay marriage can be adverse.\nOn the other hand, forbidding marriages that are not heterosexual equals ignoring the basic rights and freedoms of every person. Besides, the research in Utah shows that the previously mentioned fear is completely irrational and Global Health Organization declared that being homosexual is not one of the mental problems. When couples live together and love each other but can not be bounded by official documents, it can cause a lot of legal problems. For instance, when one of them is in the hospital in critical condition, the other can not make a decision about treating or even visiting a beloved one due to the fact that they are not legally related. Such conditions could lead even to fatal consequences.\nIn conclusion, I believe that each individual person can have their own opinion, but this should not affect other people's lives in a negative way. That`s why I think that homosexual marriages should be legalized.",

It is argued that the government should be held solely responsable for this pandemic, but I personally disagree with this statement.\nThe government is already taking measures to prevent this devastating issue. Firstly, it is promoting numerous campaigns against obersity at a young age showing the detrimental effects that this condition can trig in a life time with the terrific consequences. Moreover, authorities are trying to correct unhealthy habits, taxing sugar in drinks and foods and removing sweet and high fat products from public areas, such as schools and hospitals. Therefore, Government can be consider highly active on confining the increased percentage of overweight children.\nNot only ministries are exstensively advertising health pattern to control weight and discourage consumption of toxic products, but they are also involving the communities in outdoor events, such as presenting the new city soccer team. So that, while promoting sports and active lifestyle, youngster can be influenced by these athletes to pursue a better physical conditions. Nevertheless, government is promptly enhancing the importance of personal training class in primary school offering schoolars the possibility of choosing gym as extra class to add to their curriculum.\nTo conclude, although obesity rates are rapidly raising, I do not agree that government is responsible of this outcome. Clearly, it is broadly active engaging children in outdoor activities, yet limiting products from public areas. Hence, authorities are commiting to prevent this plague that could have horrible consequences on future adults.",

    "essay": "Obesity among children has risen in the past years. Parents and government share the responsibility to keep children well-being. This essay will discuss reasons and examples of how both sides have responsibilities toward the children.\nTo begin with, Politicians should have an obligation to legislate laws that stop some food companies from selling high-calorie diets in the country. Laws toward diet companies should ban them from increasing sweeteners in candies to rise profits. In the same manner, the government has a duty to build outdoor play-ground and clubs to help parents raise healthy kids. Gardens should be grown to overcome obesity. In the UAE each block in the city has its own garden and playground. Research in the Netherlands shows a huge decline in obese children after the government renewed old playgrounds.\nParents on the other hand share a tremendously important rule. Parents should encourage their children to practice sports and substitute bad habits. Pampering the kids with a sweetened diet should be stopped. Parents should read about the effect of obesity on their kids' health. For example, simple sugar rise the glucose level rapidly causing the unexpected energetic status of the kid before bedtime. Some medical cases were seen among children related to obesity like cardio-pulmonary illnesses. If the parents were aware of these consequences they would discourage the bad habits of their children.\nTo sum up, government do its role in keeping the kids' wellness by building institutions and providing laws on their behalf. Also, parents should educate themselves and their children, and stop unnecessary food habits.",

    "essay": "It is believed that responsibility for the rise in obesity in children is on government. I strongly disagree with this opinion. I think that state policy cannot lead to the people's obesity. Moreover, I am sure that only parents are responsible for their children diseases.\nFirst of all, it is important to say that government's actions can not be followed with the obesity. It is responsible only for control that all available products are not dangerous for people's health. Food that consist of a lot of fats do not put your health under the threat after the first consumption. Only overeating of this kind of food can be harmful for your health leading obesity. For instance, there is no government's responsibility if you go to the mall and buy 6 cans of beer providing health problem for yourself. I am sure that government is responsible only for making 1 can of beer acceptable for your health.\nSecondly, children's actions and potential consequences of these actions should be controlled by their parents. Obesity can be a result of a permanent overeating. Because of their age, chilldren cannot control themselves. That is why this responsibility goes on their parents. As it was mentioned before, there is no product that can be harmful for the healh after the first and the only consumption. There is no reason to condemn government because of the permanent consumption of any products. For example, child could eat 3 pieces of cake insted of 1 just because of his wish. In this case, his parents should stop him after the first one to avoid potential obesity.\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that I do not see any reasons to say that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children. It has no responsibility for people's overeating and lack of parents' control over their children.",

    "essay": "Some people nowdays are really interested in finding out their families history. There are a lot of web-services which will help to create your own genealogical tree. Some people even hire a special agent, who help them to invistegate some information from various source of infromation.\nBut why do people do this? In my opinion, there are two main arguments. First of all, some country offer a citizenship for people with specific roots. For example, if you have Jewish roots, you can recieve Israel citizenship. For repatriation you need to have just a quater Jewish roots, it means, that your grandmother or grandfather must be Jewish. Sometimes it could be really difficult to provide it, but genealogical tree is a good support. Second reason why do people explore their history is just curiosity. It is really intresting to understand who were your ancestors. Maybe they were just labor or fermers, but maybe they were very famous people.\nIn my opinion, this is positive, that people are intresting in their history. As I see, when people are interested in their own history, they become more involved in history of their country or even in world history. In general, history is very important subject, because it could give general overview on how our society works. Also, creating family tree is good oportunity to establish relationship with distint relatives and spend excellent time with your familly.\nTo summarise, finding out one's family history has two main reasons. In my opinion, it is really good, that people are intresting in their famillies history.",

    "essay": "In some countries it is a common practice for people to track down their bloodline's history. People give different motivations as to why they do it. I suppport this activity for reasons I will further explain in this essay.\nTo begin with, some people want to get information about their family's history just of pure interest. It can be a great hobby for someone to invest their time and enegry into. It will help one destress and have some fun, while also enrichening his area of knowledege. In addition to having something entertaining do to in their free time, one will learn a lot about what his family has been thorugh long before he was born. This is really important because without our anscestors we would not have been born or in other words - without the past there would be no future. If one respects his family and himself enough, he should learn about who they were and where they came from.\nFurthermore, learning about one's family history can be very benefitial in finding your talents. For instance, if someone finds out that in the family there once was someone who was great footballer, then this is something one should try out. Geneticaly, some people are born with specific talents, predisposing them to pursuit a ceratin career path. Being aware of your family's past can be a great hint towards your strenghts and weaknesses.\nIn conclusion, finding out your family's history is not only a fun hobby that you can do in your spare time, it can also assist you in finding your talents in life without having to always try out new activities.",

    "essay": "The world was a completely different place a century ago and it is a common belief that our ancestors had to face many hardships in order to provide their future generations with a comfortable and fulfilling lifestyle. Therefore, some people across the world try to research their own family's history in order to appreciate their efforts, this may be out of curiosity. This essay argues that one should not put out their inquisitiveness and should try to learn more about how their family really came to be.\nInquiring about one's predecessors should be persured as learning more about your own family can never be harmful, infact, doing so will only make one more appreciative towards their family and its history. Like, if it is revealed that one's family had made many sacrifices in order to preserve their bloodline and nuture it to what it is today then it would make the current family members thankful for what they have and where they stand.\nHaving knowledge about one's own family tree is one of the ways to make a person humble and appreciative for what they have, it also teaches a person to work hard for their own family in the future in order to provide them with a good and healthy life. Nowadays, majority of the families have cultures and customs exclusive to their own family and by studying their ancestors, the true significance of these activities can be discorvered, taught and passed down to the future generations.\nTo summarize, this essay believes that there really are no negatives in learning about one's own family tree, in fact, there are many positives in doing so. Asking parents to talk about their own families is a good way to build healty relationships and the knowlege gained can be passed down to future generations and the familty ehnicity can be preserved and cherished for many more decades.",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
    "essay": "The topic of motivation for work has merely failed to be discussed. Someone elaborate that the most significant factor is money while others suppose it is not. As far as I am concerned, although money is of great importance, it cannot always be the most valuable one.\nUndoubtedly, money can be a crucial factor to diminish the financial burden of families, especially for those who were born in a poverty-stricken area. To be more specific, only by earning sufficient money can they raise their later generations and keep the elderly. Provided that they cannot find a decent job that allow them to own some disposable money, it would add insult to injury.\nHowever, there are a great number of factors that may be considered as worthwhile to be the motivation of stay in the staff by some people. First of all, being in the workforce can help to strengthen an individualÃ¢ÂÂs interpersonal skills. It is widely acknowledged that there are a colossal number of activities as well as team programmes that require people to collaborate, compromise and compete with the others. Thus, individuals will tend to learn some social skills and become gregarious and sociable, which can help them better adapt themselves to the mainstream society. In addition, people may also get a chance to broaden their horizons and lay a firm basis for future development by staying in the workforce. For instance, under the circumstance that numerous companies may provide the staff with the opportunity to go abroad and get involved in some international programs, people are able to get access to different cultures. As a result, people can develop panning-for-gold thinking rather than sponge-feeding thinking in the process of understanding divergent cultures, which can be beneficial for their future careers.\nIn conclusion, although money is valuable for individuals to be in the workforce, there are many other factors that cannot be overlooked. Only by treating all the factors rationally can we enjoy the pleasure rather than pressure.",

    "essay": "Many people believe that money is the main reason why employees want to remain in the same workplace for a long time, even there could be many other reasons why to stay. It is true that nowadays almost everything is somehow connected to money, but I still believe there are some exceptions.\nThe reason why I agree with this statement is because society today is built up on finance resources. People somehow believe that if you do not have expensive things or an amazing car you are below them. Since money is the merit of a popularity and a good life, many people are remaining in the same job if they are going to be promoted or they are going to receive a pay raise soon, even though coworkers are poisonous and bad for their mental health. For example, it is easier to stay in their position with good money and bad colleagues than to change their job and try to make their way up again.\nOn the other hand, a lot of youngsters will probably choose the good working environment and nice group of people with who they will be working with, before a long payroll. Of course, it is pleasant to receive a huge amount of money every month but, if you will be working with people who are rude and annoying, you will be out of energy soon and moreover your workforce will be lower as same as your payment in the end.\nIn conclusion, I mostly agree with this averment because money is the great motivation for people, but I would also like to point up the importance of a great working group as it is another reason why to choose to stay where you are.",

    "essay": "With the development of society, it goes without saying that more people come to prior their carrier to their own private life. Some people say that this is due to money, however, I strongly oppose that money has the hugest impact on this choice in modern society. I feel this way for 2 reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.\nTo begin with, working is considered one of the crucial factors to fulfill people's life. Specifically, most people would be satisfied when they are helpful to others through their work. Besides, these experiences would easily contribute them to further hard work. Above all, human beings originally like being appreciated by someone. To be more specific, I like my job because I can feel self-confident through my work. It is manifest that money is not only the vital motivation for working in this regard.\nSome augments can be made that social status gained through the success of their business must be crucial enough to direct people to work. The main reason for this is that experiences of success would bring excitement and happiness to them. They also could feel superior to others. Close examination would reveal that people with high social status could have tons of options compared with common people. That is to say, it is completely evident that higher social status can become an important factor as money.\nHaving considered all the augments above, I would conclude that only money has the most influence on motivation for business.

It's undeniably true that we need money to sustain our daily life. We have to use our money to pay our bills such as foods, electricity, debt and other basic needs. Furthermore, we know that the number of the number of inflation keeps increasing this year due to the unstabilty of the economic circumstance which results in the increament of goods prices. Having said that, money becomes very essential reason to stay in the company because it really helps us to afford a better life.\nHowever, in my opinion, there is another important aspect that we should consider when we are in middle of deciding whether to stay in the company or not. The important aspect is the working environment. Aside from money, we have to make sure that we can improve our skills in the current employment. By having a positive and supportive working environment, we will be able to maximize all of our capabilities which can make us a better person professionally.\nIn conclusion, I agree that money becomes one of the most important factor that we should consider in choosing our job as we need money to afford a good life.

    "essay": "The public is rarely found agreeing on one opinion. One might take a simpe problem such as manufacturers responsible for excessive packaging, or customers should avoid buying such goods as example. Let me tackle this problem in brief.\nManufacturers and supermarkets may be noticed selling their goods excessivly packaged, and that may dissatisfy a portion of their customers. Those customers believe that such sellers should reduce such packaging. Looking into it, it sounds that sellers would also be responsible if their goods where damaged, which would lead to a decrease in income. It also does cost a little more to wrap goods securely to avoid damage, so while that may be a little inconvenient for manufacturers, it is necessary to avoid serious losses later on.\nCustomers have full right to avoid excessivly packaged goods, if it so contrasts their taste. They may feel it is tiresome to unwrap, or hard to get rid of all the mess it creates afterwords. They would think that is a manufacturer's task to unwrap the goods once they are available at the market, or even once the arrive at their houses if it is an online service. It would logically seem much convenient to them to have instant access to their product instead of all the unpackaging that preceeds the unboxing purchased goods.\nPersonally, I believe a little unwrapping isn't so invonvenient, and it doesn't have to fall on a manufacturer to unwrap his goods before selling. A little unpackaging might even be thrilling sometimes, to build up excitement before unboxing your awaited product. I'd add, with little offense meant, that people are getting a little lazy to do a simple task as unpackaging.",

A lot of people believe it is the manufacturers and supermarkets responsibility to reduce packaging of goods, while others believe that it is the individuals responsibility to avoid buying products with a lot of wrapping and packaging.

In my country it is believed that these companies should be held responsible by the government. For example in Denmark the government provides manufacturers and stores with certain environmental regulations, which also include the amount of material these facilities are allowed to use for packaging. This helps reduce environmental harm and provides more responsibility to companies to reduce packaging.\nHowever, the majority of people believe that this problem is an individual responsibility. This opinion considers that the moral obligation falls on the individual and not the company. The people who believe that it is an individual responsibility to not buy these products, believe that a decreased demand for products that harms the environment will lead to more environmentally friendly products produced.\nTo summarize, both of these opinions help reduce environmental harm. However, I believe that it is the individuals responisibility to not purchase overly packaged products, since this decrease in demand would lead to less production of these goods.",

    "essay": "Opnions are divided on whether manufacturers and supermarkets should reduce the numbers of packaging of products, or consumers should not buy over-packaging goods. From my perspective, although asking customers take this action is reasonable, I strongly hold that these service providers should play a more important role in this issue.\nOn the one hand, the reason why some people think customers should have more duties is that it ia driven by their demand. To be more specific, this is because they choose to buy some things with good packaging. But these goods are usually over packaged. Hence, if they reduce their demands for such products, producers and sellers naturally stop over package them to avoid a reduction in their busidness profits. For example, more and more people are persuaded to simply use a piece of paper to wrap the gift box instead of using a large number decorations.\nOn the other hand, they think it is driven by merchants as they have more control on it. Specifically, in order to sell goods better, they uauslly regard packaging as a tool to attract purchasers. In addition, if their competitors find it does help the sale of products, it also promote the competition on the packaging, which can further lead to excessive packaging. Take fast food for example, it is obviously that sometimes using just one bag can fit all food, but to gain a greater advantage over the competition, they may use a box or more to wrap them, and then, it creates a vicious cycle of over-packaging.\nIn conclusion, even though customers can help to solve this case, I believe manufacturers and supermarkets should take the main responsibility to reduce over-packaged goods, becasue if all sellers are competiting on it, customers will have no choices.",

    "essay": "In recent years, a variety of crimes and other violent news on television, in newspapers, as well as on the Internet report might have increased to a few decades ago. Although some people might be concerned these reports have adverse consequences, I disagree the news should be reported continuously.\nTo begin with, some parents might be concerned that these reports might be harmful to their children. Children tend to be susceptible to any information, including enjoyable news, and heavy crime news. Therefore, some parents just hope their children watch some healthy news, such as entertainment, sports, and technological innovation news.\nOn the other hand, some crimes, including violence, and murder cases should\nnot diminish the volume of news. Recently, the Japanese media tend to hide the actual violent scene. In addition, reporters, and writers tend to explain the detail in the verbal report, or detail in letters. This news must be helpful for parents to prepare some ideas for their children in order not to be involved in some dangerous crimes. For example, parents recently give a cell phone to children to contact any time. In addition, the parents can observe where the children are 24/7 by taking advantage of GPS.\nFinally, Japan is one of the safest countries across the globe. Therefore, Japanese people tend to overrate the Japanese society that crimes, including violence, will never happen to our life. In contrast, looking at some reports of crimes and other kinds of violent news will be a great trigger to educate children in order not to be murdered, and avoid kidnapping by criminals.\nIn conclusion, it is necessary to report crimes and other kinds of violent news for all people to prepare unpredictable future.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, more and more criminal activities and violent events are showed on television and in newspapers. Some people consider that we should restrict those kinds of information because of the adverse outcomes. However, in my opinion, those events shown in the media should not be restricted for the following reasons.\nFirstly, reporting of criminal activities and other violent news can reduce crimes. If those criminal and violent information can be showed to the public, people can clearly understand the whole process and detailed scenes of crimes, provoking them more easily think critically serious consquences. Abusing durgs, for example, people will be afarid of the severe effects on both social and personal areas when they vivily see real outcomes it may bring, thus prevent them from committing criminal acts. Hence, there will be fewer criminal activities or violent events occurring on our society. That is why we should not restrict criminal activities being shown in the media.\nIn addition, restricting the criminal activities may lead to a high rate of crimes. If people cannot easily obtain those information, they may consider that no one care about it and even take part in some criminal activities without thinking. Because they cannot image detailed impacts on social and personal aspects when they think wether can do it or not. Finally, to a large extent, they may commit cirmes and cause some severe consquences, which may bring nagative effects on society.\nIn conclusion, I agree that we should show criminal activities and violent events in the media , which can largely reduce crimes. Moreover, we should also think much more about that restricting this kind of information may lead to a high rate of crimes.",

If the public can directly get the criminal informations, which lead to a whole understanding of the criminal process, provoking them more easily to thinking critically inculding the bad effects on social and personal areas. Take abusing drugs for example, people will afraid to touch drugs if they can vividly see the serious outcomes of abuse, which can effectly prevent them to do some crimnal things.

This gives them opportunity to steal it.\nBy watching the news, this will alert the public to be on the look out and prevent the thieves from stealing valuable items from us.

    "essay": "During the dinner, most of families like to watch news on television or read newspapers. Sometimes these news could be violents and it could be an issues for our childs. Some people argues that they should be restricted. In my point of view, it is important to protect child from these horrific images, but also we need to keep informed them about the world if we want to protect them.\nFirst of all, children and young people need to be protect from these violent informations. One mean to accomplish that, is to explain to them these kind of violent images. Because, they are in fairly part of their development and that could be have a huge impact on their mental health. For instance, if your children saw an image of attentat in a high school, as a result, it could be difficult for him to go back at school further. Morover, he could likely developed mental health problem, as a phobia or anxiety about high school.\nOn the other hand, it is important to keep inform them about the real world and they need to be prepare for theses situations. For example, if an attack arrived at their school, your children will be prepared for. Conversely, if they did not watched news, and an attack reached the school, they will not be able to protect them and the consequence could be terrible. As far, news allow us to predict the world and be able to protect us and our family.\nAs far, we have seen it is important to keep contact with reality, because nowadays, our world are violent and as a result, some image could be violent. They need also to be protect from mental health problems, and so we need to explain that they watch and these images.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, it is often said that mass media interest in reporting crimes and violence happening in our society may lead to negative effects. Therefore, there is a public debate over the opportunity of excluding this kind of news from mass media, such as newspapers or television. In this essay, I will summarize the grounds for my stance, which is completely in favour of this viewpoint.\nThe mair reason why I believe that crimes and violence news should be restricted is the emulation risk. In this view, television is often watched by kids left alone, who may not be able to fully undestand what they see. Therefore, if they continue to hear about violence and crimes, they may begin to consider them as a normal part of our society and start adopting these behaviours. For instance, a teenager may think that it is normal to fight with someone else in case of an argue outside pubs or clubs.\nAnother reason in favour of crimes and violence news restriction is the exaltation of criminals. This may be epitomised by serial killers: on one side they are sentenced for terrible crimes, but on the other hand are sometimes proposed to accept a huge amount of money in order to make interviews or write books about their stories. If media did not talk about these crimimals, none of them would earn money as a consequence of its guilts.\nIn conclusion, I believe that there are many valid reasons for claiming a reduction of violence and crimes news on social media. Emulation of wrong behaviours by young people and enrichment of criminals are two of the most common arguments. All thing considered, I strongly advocate the need of restricting mass media's time spent to talk about crimes and violence. This aim may be pursued by public authorities, through the promulgation of new laws and rules.",

    "essay": "Environmental problems are the biggest issue that people have to concern and by product form fossil fuels is one of causes. Someone think one way that can reduce result from fuels is sale car fuels in higher price. In my opinion, I disagree with this because highly price of oil leads to other problems such as financial problem and impact to food price, moreover, we can heal their environment by other ways.\nThe negative effects of increasing the cost of vehciles fuels are improtant to human life. The significant points is price of basic requirements, for instance, foods and medicines which have to transportation by trucks that use oil fuels for movement. The expensive fuels increase business costs, so their products price are rising up. Futhermore, social problems follow by financial problems. When poor people do not have money but they still hunger, they will steal some food or water this situation roads to social problems.\nOther ways to reduce environment problems, the causes of this problem are not only fossil fuel but also agricultural or industial aspect which we have to focus on. Intustial areas are the top areas that make lot of pollutions such as air pollution, water pollution from thier procesing and chemical pollution which they use during process. Those of them lead to many problems and effect to qulity of human life.

    "essay": "Some people and governments believe in reducing the carbon dioxide of cars and other vehicles is the most effective way to solve the environment problem. Although there are some points also neccesaliry developed except for car and other vehicles, I believe spending the cost of fuel for cars which do not emit detrimental substances play the biggest effect for environmental improvement.\nCars, and other vehicles, such as airplanes are ubiquitous around the world. People rely on most transport type must be cars around the world, even in developing countries. In addition, recent cars released in a few decades tend to be durable and the most of energy is petrol which resource is made of fossil fuel. This means that cars emit carbon dioxide across the globe and the highest volume of carbon dioxide is considered by cars. Therefore, the majority of fact about global warming is caused by cars and airplanes.\nRecently, the car industry has become aware of this issue and they are starting manufacturing cars that never emit carbon dioxide. For example, some companies, especially Tesla, and Porsche had already released cars that consume energy as electricity, instead of petrol. This effort will cause a drastic reduction of transmitting carbon dioxide and some countries are planning to regulate laws all cars have to consume energy only by electricity.\nFinally, of course, there are other issues that lead to harmful environments around the world, such as deforestation, disposal of rubbish by incineration, and agriculture. For example, growing cows too much will generate methane gas which also relates to global warming. However, there is no doubt the total volume of the environmental problem must be cars; and other vehicles. Hence, it is the most effective to shift energy resources from detrimental and limited to sustainable and clean energy in the car industry must be a valuable first step to resolve environmental problems.",

    "essay": "Most vehicles release a toxic amount of fumes into the atmosphere. This, in turn, has grown into an environmental issue of global concern that governments across the world believe can be mitigated by adding on to the price of fuels. I chiefly disagree with the effectiveness of this method as next to nothing had been altered since the policy enforcement due to convenience issues.\nThe number of cars utilizing fuel has not dwindled. Even though many alternatives had been suggested, there was no mass production of transportation units for the use of average salary workers. The middle crust of society does not possess sufficient income to shift to environmentally friendly solutions for the fear of maintenance hardships. For instance, an electrical car would necessitate a spacious charging spot in front of a garage that not many possess. As a consequence, the more convenient and trustworthy solution to buy fuel is resorted to.\nThe population of the world as a whole does not stay in one place. As more and more people are born, there is a growing need for transport to be manufactured in a short span of time. Although a part of the population may be able to abandon their cars in exchange for bikes or buses, a significant portion of the growing society still opts for refueling cars in gas stations to get to places faster.\nIn conclusion, while the idea of the price policy introduction bore few fruits, they had not been enough to make a contribution to solving the carbon footprint.

Therefore, the air quality will be healthier for both animals and humans.\nIn my point of view, this decision will lead to several advantages such as increasing the number of people walking and considering bikes as a way to get anywhere they need. Therefore, goverments will change the current cities structure which are fundamentally depending on cars and vehicles. To transform it to a complete new walkable and more practical cities instead. So that kind of actions has benefits not only for the coming few years but also the future as a whole.\nTo strengthen my opinion, when gas prices are higher than the average the majority of people will consider another transportation methods that are less damaging and more environment friendly, namely metros, modern trains, bikes or even walking around. However, people also must be educated about curtain aspects when it comes to nature and how to not experience a harmful lifestyle in general, for both the nature and the human race.\nto summarize, increasing the gas prices without spreading awarness among youngsters equivalently would not be a convenient action. To confirm, extreme low gas prices could lead to another consequence that is traffic which creates a suffocating atmosphere that will surely kill wild animals and people as well as the years go by.",

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\nIn this modern age, some believe that peopleÃ¢ÂÂs quality of life is much better than that of earlier generations in past centuries. I agree with this point of view thanks to the development of healthcare service and technology in this century regardless of some opposing opinions.\nTo begin with, some think of this school of thought in the sense that people living in the previous centuries were less prone to diseases caused by the degradation of the environment. For example, air pollution these days has caused people a multitude of fatal respiratory diseases, be it tuberculosis or even lung cancer. These illnesses were believed to happen to a handful of citizens in the past, such as long-term smokers or workers in mines. However, in this modern age, people appear to have remedies for aforementioned diseases or, at least, methods to mitigate them. As regards the former, scientists have been believed to invent medicines to cure these diseases while, for the latter, air purifiers have filtered toxic fumes in the atmosphere, reducing the risk of suffering from respiratory diseases.\nThe standard of living in the 21st century is in all probability better than our predecessors thanks to technological transmogrification. Firstly, the improvements of the Internet has allowed people to connect with others from all over the world via communication platforms, such as social networking sites or emails. This will help people be happy. Additionally, the advancement of technology is beneficial for information storage. For example, data is, now, can be limitlessly stored in the Internet with less concern of being damaged. This did not happen in the past, when information was believed to be saved on papers or hard disks, which were prone to damage due to extreme weather patterns.\nIn conclusion, I believe that people living in the 21st century have a better quality life than the past.",

It is said to be the purest form of art but it is often claimed that the main purpose of music is to make people feel relaxed.\nMusic addresses our psychological, mental, and spiritual needs giving us relaxation. Without any doubt, it is a sure thing that there is no day when a person does not listen to music not even once and this is really helpful for them to reduce their stress after a tiring day at work and our brain produces some healthy endorphins.\nThis makes them mentally refreshed and also intensifies their moods. For example, I am really passionate about easygoing soul music or folk songs and listen to them with the help of several singing apps. As a result, it soothes my mind and helps to maintain a good vibe. In addition, music has proven its healing power in the medical industry to cure various diseases. Such as listening to the verses of the Quran is being used to cure many psychological disorders.\nFurthermore, a variety of authors of songs write them with their emotions when they are happy or sad. People who face similar challenges or situations like in the lyrics of the song resonate with it and that they are not the only persons with the same problems. Nature sings to every single sound that is heard in our surroundings like the chirping of birds, and the sound of heavy rain, and even when a glass is broken there is some sort of music.\nTo conclude, I think that the most important function of music is to explain life, its beauty, meaning, and feeling.

    "essay": "Many today have come to the conclusion that the most significant effect on people of music is to relieve stress. While I agree that music also has more important positive functions other than reducing stress.\nOn the one hand, I have to admit that music is a good way to reduce stress and it do plays an important role in our daily life. A good example of this can be seen in Shanghai, where has a large number of single karaoke rooms in the office buildings. As we all know, compared to the others cities in China, the people living in Shanghai face more stress, like the surprisingly high price of house and the fierce competition of work. Those public karaoke rooms, which were provided by the government for the public, become a good place for people to enjoy the music and have fun.\nOn the other hand, for many people, music is an ideal career to persue in their life, like the job as an accountant, which can bring them with incomes and improve their living standard. For example, the TV programs related to music attract more and more people to participate in, like The Voice. Most of the participants wish to show their excellent peformance in music through these stages with the purpose of having access to more business opportunities and making more money at the same time. It is undeniable that the following income would be exponential increased than before if they succeed finally.\nIn conclusion, it is not doubt that music is very essential for us, not only for its spiritual meanings, but also for its more important role in our society which could allow the person to relise their dream while creating more economical benefits.",

    "essay": "Many today have come to the conclusion that the most significant effect on people of music is to relieve stress. While I agree that music also has more important positive functions other than reducing stress.\nOn the one hand, I have to admit that music is a good way to reduce stress and it do plays an important role in our daily life. A good example of this can be seen in Shanghai, where has a large number of single karaoke rooms in the office buildings. As we all know, compared to the others cities in China, the people living in Shanghai face more stress, like the surprisingly high price of house and the fierce competition of work. Those public karaoke rooms, which were provided by the government for the public, become a good place for people to enjoy the music and have fun.\nOn the other hand, for many people, music is an ideal career to persue in their life, like the job as an accountant, which can bring them with incomes and improve their living standard. For example, the TV programs related to music attract more and more people to participate in, like The Voice. Most of the participants wish to show their excellent peformance in music through these stages with the purpose of having access to more business opportunities and making more money at the same time. It is undeniable that the following income would be exponential increased than before if they succeed finally.\nIn conclusion, it is not doubt that music is very essential for us, not only for its spiritual meanings, but also for its more important role in our society which could allow the person to relise their dream while creating more economical benefits.",

    "essay": "People tend to use more informal words in their language to express and communicate with each other rather than following formal words.\nThere are several reasons for this, and I believe that it has some disadvantages and advantages. The key contributor to informal writing is technological innovation. For instance, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram allow people to send texts to each other anywhere and anytime just by connecting to the internet.\nFurthermore, the texting culture of using abbreviated phrases has grown increasingly prevalent. As a result, applying casual language in written form has become more popular, and this substantially affects the written language.\nI believe that this trend may carry a certain degree of risk. Firstly, when using written language in an easier going way many times, people can forget how to write a formal letter. In fact, the current generation gets used to texting, so the young are not aware of how to write a formal email to apply for a job. Instead, they write these emails like they are texting with friends.\nSecondly, informal writing can adversely affect the academic performance of students. The students tend to utilize abbreviated words or slang in essays and assignments that require a greater level of formality.\nOne evident benefit to having more informal written communication in our professional lives is that it is less time-consuming. For instance, busy individuals working on the same task can share information instantly through a quick chat, rather than write a long and formal mail chain that requires thoughtful editing and proofreading.\nIn conclusion, although there are disadvantages to using informal words in written language, there are also attractive advantages. I believe individuals should use informal words when texting with family and friends but when it's an office or business-related work then they should use formal words in written language.",

    "essay": "It is noticeable that when we write something we try to use more informal language. Moreover the written text is more redundant, cohesive, calm and patient. From my point of view, it comes because we erase emotions from written text which we spread sometimes without intention via voice. Not only voice influence on it, but during the writing we have a chance to revise and check our text. Moreover this fact has advantages and disadvantages.\nOn the one hand, there is a huge advantage of this cartain. When we communicate through formal language and when we are more relaxed we have a chance to spread our ideas more thoroughly. For instance, I sometimes observe that for me it is easier to convince someone to help me if I write to him or her.\nOn the other hand, there is a disadvantage, that when we switch on to the speech from writing other people will be surprised or astonished with the differences. For example, during my work, I communicate via messages more than via calling. Sometimes there are cases when after this switching people notice that I was rude and insult them.\nFinally, written language is more relaxed and less formal. This fact has a lot of cons and pros. I think that cons dominate under pros. What is more, it is a nice way to mix this kind of communication for best results. Neither written way nor speaking will increase your chance to be recognizable in the right way if your basic idea is not relevant to consumers of your main idea.",

    "essay": "Nowadays most people tend to write in a more informal way, adopting a relaxed approach. This essay will cover the reasons why this behavior is so common, starting from the necessity of a more quick way to communicate, and then it will attempt to illustrate if it has advantages and disadvantages.\nHence the necessity to interact in a quicker way, due to the business of life at the present time, many people prefer to cure less the formal aspects of their written pieces. This rapidness has been allowed by the spread of emails as the principal mean of written communication. Likewise, the reader itself, having much less time, is prone to take just a rapid look at the emails, not caring much if the way they are written is formal or not.\nOn the one hand, this can lead to some advantages, such as a more relaxed atmosphere even in workplaces. For example, many workers are relieved to know that their boss is keen on writing informal emails and does not pretend his subordinates to do otherwise. Moreover, it has some positive implications also for strangers, that are often less prepared to write in a formal style.\nOn the other hand, it is often hard to draw a limit. Some readers can think that the person sending the informal email is just being rude, leading to a misunderstanding. This is particularly true when the generation gap is taken into consideration: generally, elder people may be less willing to receive an informal letter.\nIn conclusion, the reasons behind a more relaxed style in written language may be found in the faster means of communication. This has undoubtedly advantages, such as the creation of a more peaceful ambient. Albeit, there are also clear disadvantages, for instance, the misinterpretation of the context.",

    "essay": "Written language has been in human history since many thousand years ago. It was first developed through ancient egyptians and other old civilizations to keep history safe and remembered. It was then reformed for learning, teaching, documenting know-how and building new civilizations. From the Latin to the modern English, an enormous amount of changes and developments have emerged. Such things were derived through the intent of humanbeings to use easier language to deliver its usages. I am of the opinion, that changing language and using it in a more relaxed way could destroy its basis and strong meanings, which it shall deliver in its original form.\nUsing a less formal language for writing could be associated with multiple different advantages. More people will be able to write using a language easier and faster, if it is in a more relaxed way compared to the formal version of it. So using such easy version of the language, could promotes the amount of written work, which accordingly supports the idea of keeping our culture remembered. For instance, the amount of written stories in English has doubled through the years after making the english a more easier language to apply and write with. Furthermore, such more relaxed language will help many non-fluent speakers learn and use the language faster, which shall increase the amount of people speaking this specific language.\nOn the other hand, a couple of critical disadvantages could be distinguished applying such strategy in the written language. Maybe the amount of written ressources increased massively in the last couple of hunderd years, but what about the quality and sophistication of such materials? Are these materials concrete, concise and accurate? Are those materials capturing the needed knowledge within the current generation successfully? These questions trigger that easier language to use doesn't neccessarily mean better documents, but rather massive irrelevant amount of expolited work.\nTo summarive, I tend to be of the opinion, that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages of using a less formal language in writing. The long-term perspective could be significantly critisized, as only short-sighted point of views, shall think, that such methodology of written language helps human civilizations thrive in any way.",

    "essay": "Food crisis might be considered as one of the most worrying matters among the globe. Despite the fact that poverty ratios are constantely increasing, tonnes of foods were thrown away every year. I believe that uncountable reasons could be behind this awful phenomenon, and many solutions should be taken to reduce the amounts of these wasted foods and to reduce the starvation. I will mention some in this essay.\nStarting from the root causes, cooking a feast for a small group of people might be considered part of any country's culture such as many countries in the golf area, or otherwise, the person would look as stingy or even a bad host. Although some people order a huge amount of food just for the purpose of bragging, sometimes it could be due to wrong estimation of the number of guests or the portion that is needed for each individual.\nNevertheless, such matter should have immediate solutions, on both personal and global level. Governments should take all actions needed to increase the awareness of the danger of this problem and its negative consequences, whether through social media platforms or through the national TV, and to find innovative ways to hold their citizens responsible for minimising such cruical issue. Moreover, individuals should always make sure to donate the extra food to any person that is in need.\nIn conclusion, wasting food has been a significant issue since very long time ago. There are many reasons for this unpleasant habit, whether due to cultural impact or personal attitude; therefore, fast actions must be taken from both individuals and governments.",

    "essay": "In recent years, the crisis of food wasting has drawn the attention from all over the world. In my perspective, there are reasons to this problem and some measures should be taken into effect to reduce the amount of wasted food.\nFranklly speaking, based on my observation, there are several factors that leads to the food-wasting crisis. Firstly, with the aid of modern technology, especially those related to farming industry, we can get much more stable access to all kinds of crops than our predecessors, which means we no longer need to live in a food-saving lifestyle, thus leading to a number of wastes in terms of food. Secondly, due to lack of educations on saving food in school, the youngsters nowadays tend to be unaware of the importance of adequete food. As a result, people are used to order more amount of food than they actually need, constituting more food is wasted everyday. Finally, as the burgeon of economy in most countries, the fashion of showing off to others is curved into the mind of pubilc, resulting a number of extravegent consuming that could cost plenty of food wasted.\nSince the problem of food wasting is taking place everywhere around the globe right now, it is urgent for us to take some actions to deal with the problem. In my opinion, as it is impossible to reverse the development of science, we should then focus on educaitions, specifically children's education. For example, several lectures could be given to the elementary school students to highlight the hardships to grown crops for our ancestors, as well as the reason why we should save the food we eat everyday. On top of that, the autorities could organise the student for some visits to the farming field, where they can learn the basic knowledges needed for farming industry and then understand how harsh it is to grow food that is sold on market nowadays. Once the children aware of the importance of saving food, there certainly will be less food thrown away on a day to day basis.\nTo sum up, both technologies and lack of public education give birth to food wasting. Althogh several methods could be taken to deal with the problem, it is through our joint effort to reduce the food thrown away everday. Actions need to be implemented swiftly.",

This essay will discuss the reason that people are wasting food and suggest a viable solution.\nThe principal reason is that people are unable to finish their dishes as they often take more portions of food than they can, which can cause more food to be wasted. For instance, buffets are the most common place that wastes tons of food, especially in hotels. Hence, as more food you pick, the more reasonable the price of the buffet is.\nWasting food is slowly becoming people's habit in this modern world.

For instance, buffets are the most commonly wasted tons of food, especially in the hotel. Hence, as more food you pick, the more reasonable the price of the buffet is.\nA solution to this worrying problem is to take away the leftovers back home. As food can be kept for a few days in the refrigerator, people can cook it at their house without going out to afford meals. As a result, this can reduce the expenditure on food and transportation. In my experience, my mother would pack the leftover food and bring it back home. As a result, the food still tastes the same at the restaurant. Thus, my family and I will never discuss what to eat for the rest of the day. Had it not been for preventing food waste by bringing it back home, the amount of waste foods would never have been able to reduce.\nIn conclusion, one of the main problems with the over-wasting of food in many countries is unable to finish the food and this can be solved by taking away the food back home. It is predicted that more and more individuals will be taking away their remaining food to their accommodation and this will reduce the amount of waste food.",

    "essay": "Living in the 21st Century, it is without doubt that most of us already possess the luxury of having everything we need such as shelter, clothes and most importantly food and water. Despite this, it is sad to say that there are still a handful of the world's population that remain in the depths of poverty. And even so, many countries are found guilty to wasting huge amounts of food. In this essay, I will discuss the reason behind this food wastage and suggest solutions to reduce this effect.\nFirst and foremost, why do people waste food? It is to my belief that people tend to take more food than they can handle, especially at functions like all-you-can-eat buffets alongside weddings which act as a few of the many major contributers of food waste. In general, there is also the lack of awareness on poverty among the public to blame for. Therefore, people cannot practice consideration towards a cause they are unfamilar or unaware of. Other than that, they lack exposure to knowledge on the impact that food waste can bring to the environment and the society.\nNow, what actions can we take to reduce amount of food disposed? The government and country's leaders should take the first step in conducting educational campaigns on food wastes and poverty, particularly targeting school children and the public. This can play a significant role in shedding light onto the issues that need to be addressed urgently. People should also be strongly encouraged to take a more sensible amount of food before coming back for seconds to avoid the unecessary wastage as well as the excess weight gain.\nTo sum up, food wastage is not something to be proud of because of the all the adverse effects brought upon us, humans. Hence, we should quickly make the much needed change to help to turn this situation around and hopefully contribute to creating a better society.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, many countries are confronted with the increasing amount of waste and one of the major contributions is food wasted by people. This issue is mainly driven by an over-ordered food and misunderstanding about the method of food disposal. However, people could cease from creating food waste through the act of both restaurants and governments.\nTo begin with, it is obvious that countries have wasted because the amount of food that people buy is more than the amount they need.

As a result, they might understand that putting wasted food into a garbage is the only solution they could do.

In my opinion, I totally agree with this statement and many reasons will be provide in this essay.\nFor the first reason, Leadership is a skill that up to a people, and it is not specific by sexes. In modern world, there are many company that let their department lead by both women and men, and to measure the result for comparing a difference that can be shown on profits that own by each section. For example, It is can be argue if the traditional company is let women firstly lead the project rather than previous, which done by a men.

    "essay": "It is argued by some individuals that men aren't skilled enough as women in regard to leadership. This essay disagrees with the given statement as leadership skills are not depending on gender but are strongly related to people's personality and work experience.\nThe role of a leader should not be stereotyped according to gender, for example, women might be considered more powerful than men because they could normally appear more organised and perfectionist. Indeed, several studies concerning leadership and the role of the leader, have demonstrated that some people have innate attitudes of a leader regardless of their gender. Some of those attitudes are related to active listening, emotional intelligence skills and great communication abilities. Thus, if effectively developed and fostered, those skills can support individuals to achieve higher roles in leadership and management.\nIn the same way, the working experience also plays a crucial role in determining and further developing leadership skills. For example, a large number of women are still renouncing to their career paths in order to care for their families. Indeed, most of the women, apply for part-time roles which do not offer the opportunity to achieve a leadership role despite their abilities. For this reason, is difficult to affirm if women are better than men in leadership.\nTo conclude, the role of a leader is shaped by innate characteristics and people's personalities regardless of their gender. Moreover, the poor presence of women employed in leadership roles does not create pieces of evidence to support such a point of view.",

Firstly, female leadership is a relatively new trend in recent decades with the development of society and therefore has been put under the highlight. In the past, men were always seen as the superior gender to run the company and dominate the realm. At the same time, women were seldom taken into account to be qualified to do management, and in many cases, they were merely not eligible for leadership. Hence, the opportunity and success of female leadership nowadays are highly emphasized and kept firmly in peopleÃ¢ÂÂs minds, which probably leads to the imagination that women can better lead. Secondly, the statement can sometimes be regarded as propaganda for gender equality. In order to improve public awareness of the female role in leadership and create more chances for women to partake in leading, it is surely an excellent idea to set a good image of female leadership by advocating their merits. However, the decisive factors to successful leadership, which include capacities like communication, personal charisma, and intelligence, should not be misinformed.\nDespite the argument given above, I also believe that it is urgent to replace the stereotype of gender among the public, which contributes to the distinct impression of each gender about leadership. The male characteristics were traditionally defined as braveness, intelligence, and dominance, which match the requirement of leadership a lot. It is no doubt that women can be brave and able to take risks and responsibility in the leading position as well. A prime example can be female chancellor Merkel of Germany, who led the German government for more than 16 years and enjoyed a well-known reputation worldwide. Her political legend reflects the fact that the extraordinary competence of leadership does not exclusively belong to males.\nIn conclusion, although I completely agree that gender equality is of unparalleled importance. However, the key to successful leadership should never be related to gender.",

    "essay": "It is undeniable that nowadays, smart devices such as phones and tablets play an essential role in one's life. Through countless websites and applications, people can connect with each other without any boundaries. While many people agree that the introduction of these technologies has many disadvantages to the conservative way of starting and maintaining relationships, I personally believe that they rather develop new socializing methods.\nFirst and foremost, social medias and applications can help with keeping in touch with acquintances. Previously, people had to follow a precise time and location to meet up with their friends as they are unable to contact the others to reschedule. However, the internet allows them to update their plans at any time. This means that if there is any emergency, an individual can immediately postpone the upcoming event and find the next available slot to continue the plan. Furthermore, there are several applications that allow people to video call their friends and family who are currently living apart.\nThe current technologies not only offer us options to communicate with our current contacts but also allow us to discover new friends. In the past, it is difficult to find people with a common interest which had to be done through social events. Nowadays, online communities enable their users to connect with new friends virtually. Thus, fewer individuals are left alone, especially introverts and those who are living in remote areas which can have difficulties socializing offline.\nAll in all, despite the fact that there are many positive impacts of the invention of social medias and communication technologies, there are also risks and downsides of using them without face-to-face communication. Therefore, the time used for socializing online and offline should always be balanced.",

    "essay": "With the development of technology, there is a debate whether advanced communication technology would be a major contributor to worsening human relationships in modern society. In my opinion, the developing communication tool could have negative impacts on social relationships in the future. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.\nTo begin with, new technology could be out of control at an early phase of introduction. New technologies certainly enable us to live conveniently as a result, however, it often takes some time to fit them into our lifestyles under the control. Above all, the latest tool could bring worsened effects on society than we expect. To be more specific, bullying with the use of smartphone is one of the major problems all over the world today. It is manifest that new communication tools can easily devastate human relationships in this regard.\nOn the other hand, some arguments can be made that new communication tools make it possible that people across the world can have a chat without physical moving to another place. But closer examination would reveal that the introduction of new communication technology also causes fewer opportunities for people to meet up in person. A compelling example of this is that Japanese people have less relationship with their neighborhood than in the post. People living today might be satisfied with tons of telecommunication rather than direct communication. I strongly suppose this is also a negative effect on social relationships with the use of new technology.\nHaving considered all the above, I strongly believe that modern communication tools would lead to a negative result for social relationships because of uncontrollable aspects of the latest technology and loss of communication in person with the use of new communication tools.",

    "essay": "Some people believe that communication technology advancement leads to social problems. I partially agree with this statement. Social media applications such as Instagram and Facebook do have a toxic influence on people's relationships. But from the other hand, communication technology enables people to communicate freely, whether a person is physically in China or in America.\nThe rapid blooming of social media communication tools has made people's lives easier. But, there is another side of a coin Ã¢ÂÂ now individuals are able to create internet pages anonymously. This function has blown up people's trust. Now everybody can create a fake page on the internet and catfish another person, without revealing her/his personality. It is definitely a negative effect on relationships between people in general.\nNevertheless, modern communication technology connected so many people. For example, relatives who are living in different countries can preserve their family connections by communicating through online services and applications. This function can help to support relationships of people who are far away from each other. Moreover, there is evidence that people have started to date each other more, because of dating applications' progress. For shy and introverted people this is an important improvement because they can start chatting online and then gradually switch to real-life communication.\nTo conclude, modern communication technology has both benefits and drawbacks. The most important drawback is a deterioration of social trust because of the anonymous activity. But the benefits of using communication technology outweigh all the drawbacks. Communication technology gives the possibility to communicate with relatives, who are living on another edge of the planet.",

It is argued that negative consequences due to the modern communication technology can be shown in relationships of any kind.

More human-beings are comfortable with new technologies due to the elimination of anxiety or stressful feelings triggered by face-to-face meetings. Moreover, modern devices allow erasing unprofessional or informal messages with a simple click of a button.

    "essay": "With the development of technology, an increasing number of people try to acquire the latest technology such as computer programming, rather than to study history. There is a debate whether studying histroy could give us more advantages to understand the present society. In my opinion, obtaining knowledge of past history would be definitely helpful for us to live well in society today. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.\nTo begin with, looking back on history would give us the opportunity to notice mistakes which human beings used to make in the past. Specifically, all kinds of people and countries around the world had made innumerable mistakes throughout history. Besides, some of these mistakes might result in a huge number of victims. Therefore, human beings must avoid these tragedic events happening again. Above all, only knowing history could lead to avoidance of the recurrences. To be more specific, World War must be one of the serious events in human being history, and understanding of this truth have a significant impact on how we should live not to cause war again in the present society. It is manifest that leaning history is meaningful in this regard.\nOn the other hand, some arguments can be made that old stories have little something to do with our present lives. However, closer examination would reveal that all the relationships present today originally come from something in the past. Knowing history enables us to find the best way to a fruitful future. The compelling example of this is racial discrimination in the U.S. Understanding the U.S. history could give us the best manner not to deteriorate relationships in the U.S. I suppose that studying history would be helpful for all human beings from this aspect.\nHaving considered all the arguments above, learning history would be a major contributor to a better understanding of the present because we can know how to avoid the same mistake people used to made and how we should behave for the better result through history.",

While others believe that in order to identify history we have to study it to help us in our modern lives. In my opinion, in the past even if they reach wonderful experiments it could be difficult to reach to our era. However, nowadays we are capable of knowing about the old history via modern technology.\nOn one hand, old people are limited by the population which let the people in the same place communicate through symbols to be aware of enemies. Towards generations, these symbols turned into history. As a result, people think that it is just a piece of art by the old people. In fact, some of these are from scientists and have been written as a symbol. Moreover, till now those shapes meant nothing to us or are just small pieces of information.\nOn the other hand, these days the government take a step forward and is trying hard to clarify those stones and what it means, In addition, some historical centers have scientists studying the old tools in order to have an idea from studying that symbols. For instance, Tomes Addison one of his achievement was the discovery of the light lamp which we are used to living with it. Therefore, this exploration comes from studying old history. In other words, each generation is capable to help the following generation.\nIn conclusion, history is an element that can not be ignored from any period, because it could have very critical information. Finally, I believe that technology helped us recently to study those strange tools. consequently, the government should pay more attention to covering the experiment's expenses.",

    "essay": "There are two possible ways to interprete the significance of history experience for our everyday life.\nThe first point is to ignore the history experience. The main reason is based on the opinion that history never repeats. All historical persons that lived at the elder times never made their decisions in the conditions those surround us. The world has changed significantly. Technology, information, transport, medicine, human rights - all these important parts of our life has changed since the elder times. So, we can not directly copy the decisions of different problems of the elder times to our present life.\nThe second point is to use the history experience in our present life. This opinion is based on observed samples of very similar intervals of history. At different time periods in different countries there were some events or historical processes being very similar. There are a lot of examples illustrating this thought. All countries of Medieval Europe and Asia past through the feodalism period. Then leaders of that counties decided that the feodalism is not the most effective way to control the country and annuled it. Nowadays we know that experience and, I believe, there will be no attempts to buld the feodalism again. The second example is the practice of conquestions. There were a lot of great conquerrors in the world's history: Alexander Macedonian, Caesar, Chinggis-khan, Napoleon, Gitler. All the listed persons conquerred big territories, their armies were very strong. But some time past and their empires were broken. Sometimes their enemies united against the conquerrors, sometimes they just died and their successors could not save the empires. But always the empires died. Nowadays we have no any signs of old borders of that empires. Actually all state borders are based on nations' borders, not on the old conquestions.\nI think the second opinion is better. The reason is following. There are a lot of institutions in our life that we like. For example, human rights, property rights, education, medicine. All these institutions appeared as a result of historical experince. If our predecessors ignored that experience, we would never live in the modern society. In that case we would have no modern medicine and education, also we would live in the society with slaver. So, I think that we should thoroughly study the historical experience and use its conclusions in our present life.",

    "essay": "Spending money in family celebrations can be seen as a way of appreciating where one comes from. Although some people say it is a total waste of money, l assert that it is wiser.\nTo begin with, many people feel that it is of no importance to consume money on family gatherings. This is because people usually have more pressing issues in life like urgent health cases that require money. Also, some struggle to provide basic needs for their families, for example, tuitions, decent meals and shelter. For these reasons, it seems using money on family gatherings is just a luxury.\nDespite the merits of the arguments above, although many say it is wasteful to financially cater for family parties, l assert that it is crucial. One reason is that, it unites families and a sweet spirit is maintained if family members are recognised for their special days such as wedding anniversaries, birthdays and graduations where money is spent. Further, appreciation to others within the family cannot be expressed in many ways without forking out some money.\nFurthermore, money has to be spent on family get togethers where everyone is in a joyous mood so that people can catch up and release stresses from their straining personal lives. What is more, culture, closeness and love is easily displayed when families come together for such celebrations and use money for their own satisfaction. For instance, when my childhood birthdays were celebrated, l felt so much loved and l still cherish the memories as l vividly can recall.\nTo conclude, although others feel that it is money consuming to fund family gatherings, l advocate that it is a wiser option.

    "essay": "This essay will talk about the importance or not of spending lots of money on family celebrations.\nFamily celebrations are always important, at least for catholics as it happens in my country, Spain. Nevertheless in the last decade the celebrations have started to look like something aimed to show how much money you have or you can spend. For example 30 years ago a communion celebration was a familiar meeting, going first to the church and celebrating it afterwards at home or at a restaurant with the closest members of your family. This is about to disappear. Almost every family with children receiving the communion will choose to organize a big party, inviting all family members and friends, and organizing something special for children such as going to Disneyland Park (or any other theme park). The same happens with birthday parties, it seems to be a need of improving them each year, so parents struggle to find a more original idea year by year.\nOn one side it is understandable, it is a human desire to celebrate family events as much as possible. I can see the point of organizing a special event for the kids in their special days (if we stick to the communion or birthay party examples). We all wish to make these days unforgettable.\nBut, I canÃÂ´t see the point on spending so much money.\nI have been a kid of the \"old school\". When I was a child there was no option, the maximum you could get from your parents was a party at home with your 3 or 4 best friends, eat losts of sweets and when geting older even a pijama party!.\nIn conclusion I stick to the point of less is more also in this discussion. I still believe that family celebrations must remain familiar without big events but surrounded by the ones you really love and care of.",

Above all, regular appreciation toward them with spending a lot of money might enable us not to regret what we did to them if something tragic happened. To be more specific, a scientific report revealed that having a deep and peaceful relationship with someone ended up improving the quality of life. It is manifest that spending money on the family could bring us advantages in this regard.\nOn the other hand, some arguments can be made that paying money for myself is a major contributor to improving my happiness, However, closer examination would reveal that not spending a lot of money for others end up bringing us loneliness. There are a lot of things we feel satisfied with spending money for others in the world.

    "essay": "Science, as a fundamental subject, is significant for the development of technique. It contains the knowledge of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, and even medicine and astronomy. Developed countries holding great power and resource probably have grand teams of science professionals. But in many countries, there are only few of students have chance to take science class and study the further professional subjects. Although this situation seems biased, but this is not a referring to that these countries are less developed. There are some possible reasons.\nThe basic concept of science knowledge is generally given in fundamental education of many countries. In my home country, Science is a basic subject that fixed in the fundamental education system. Students come to Science in a very young age. They gain knowledge not only from textbooks, but also from experiments, and natural activities outside the school. And this kind of forms of teaching can be seen in many countriesÃ¢ÂÂ fundamental education. After entering the high school, not only science subject but also almost each subject are separated to more detailed subjects. Students are asked to choose a specific subject and study it, and expected to use it to be a career choice. And this is one of the potential causes of not having many students studying Science in some countries.\nIn developed countries, there are plenty of vacancies in different career types. For instance, we need medical professionals such as doctors and nurses, biological professionals, and even chemical and astrological professionals in the developed society to not only maintain our daily life but also to investigate and develop more advantage for the environment we are living. While in the developing or non-developed countries, there is a huge amount of the population doing farming or working in basic industrial area, which are not necessary in the usage of Science field.",

There is an evidence that the amount of students willing to learn science subjects is not sufficient. In this essay I will discuss the causes of the issue and the possible effect on society.\nThere are several casues for the fact that students tend to skip science subjects. First, studying science can be hard and exhausting. The complexity of some subjects such as math and physics requires from the student to study many hours at home. Secondly, there are students who do not only find those courses difficult, but also get low marks even after studying long hours. As for chemistry classes, some courses include labratory lessons which may not appeal to some students.\nThe importance of people having knowledge in science is great. The society relies on science on a daily basis. For instance, doctors who study medicine, must know mathematics, biology and chemistry well, because biology is relevant to the patient's body. In addition, doctors prescribe medications so they must know chemistry well. Another example is architects whose job is to plan and design buildings. Without a proper knowledge in physics, they could not plan buildings.\nDiscussing those facts, studying science can be challenging. However, it is vital for the society that students will study science. Without doctors, nurses, scientists and other professions that rely on science, the health of the society might be effected negatively.",

I think that the root of this issue are money and political problems. Also, the insufficient development of science will cause some social problems.\nFirst, to develop science, huge amount of money are required. It is necessary to establish certified facilities to provide a suitable environment for studying science and starting research. These facilities need to fulfil some international standards like ISO and IEEE which are not so easy to get, therefore the government might need to spend lots of money on building certified facilities. However, some countries dose not have such amount of money, so building certified facilities may be difficult for them to do. Second, some countries such as middle-east countries are suffering some political issues like civil war. it is difficult for them to develop science and to handle the war at the same time.\nScience influence many angles of our lives. First, life will be inconvenient. For example, people living in a poor country may not have cell phone. If there is emergency that needs to be informed immediately to others, it is difficult to find them. Second, internationally, the state of country may become low because of the low living standard of populace. Business will be influenced if the country dose not have great bargaining power. All the social issues will finally affect the financial stability and cause some sorrowful tragedies.\nIn summary, science is a key stone to develop a wealthy country.

    "essay": "This essay will talk about the general increase in talking about money.\nI will expose why I believe this is a negative development.\nIn worldwilde terms there has been a general society empoverishment.\nIn general terms, inflation has beaten the entire world very hard due to the fluctuations in energy prices, furthermore the war between Russia and Ucrania has worsen even more this fluctuation as Russia has almost stopped suppling Gas to Europe. On the other hand Ucrania was the biggest EuropeÃÂ´s seed warehouse and our economy at the food industry has also been affected by huge price increase.\nHowever salaries have not been rised up enough to reach inflation rate which directly has driven society to a loss of value. This fact induces us to speak more often and more in detail about prices, about our salaries or about our home rentals. Population wonders how come our governments are not settling different actions to repair this huge loss which is causing biggest wealth inequality rates, dividing even more the society between wealthy and poors and sending a lot of population to thicken \"the under the poverty line\" population .\nNewspapers and communication agencies daily inform about war status, but lately they are forgoting to insist on the economy crash we are suffering. Only in France there have been important strikes to report their disomfort with the enlargement of the retirement age as well as the general price increase.\nTo summarise, the economical situation worldwide is wobbling, and the least we can do is talking about it.",

    "essay": "Money can not buy happiness! Is one of the most famous sayings while talking about finances. It is argued that topics around money, wealth, and poverty are becoming dramatically more frequent between humans in different countries around the world. In my opinion, the extream part of it is a negative development; although, it has some positivities. I will address some of both sides in this essay.\nTalking about money during the major part of the day might make the person look stingy and this is an attitude that majority of the community would not like, thus, might effect on the person's social life. Moreover, having the same topic in mind all day might lead to an obsession, and as a result, this could lead to a depression because the person might not find the proper way to reach to the financial position that meets their satisfaction, which could lead to depression, or even worse such as going through illegal paths where it could destroy their lives entirely!\nNevertheless, the person should be aware of his /her income and spendings and try to enhance their financial position to the best possible way. Also, the inflation that we are currently living and the noticable increase in prices could be a driver for people to talk about money more often.\nIn conclusion, people should not be obssessed in money and to talk with everyone about it all the time. However, I believe that people should discuss this matter in order to benefit from each other, and to find more ways to enhance their quality of life.",

    "essay": "Increasing in interests about money happened in many countries worldwide. Obviously, aguements about wage and income has become popular topics for people. This essay will demonstrate reasons behide this and some possible consequences followed the statement.\nTo begin, in the modern world, social media plays a major role in which people, younger generation in particular, communicate with others. This can be a dominant cause leading to daily conversations about financial issues. For example, a plenty of contents posted on digital platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, are related to financial knowledge. This perhaps normalize the topics about financial to be more acceptable than in the past.\nFurthermore, luxury products have become an indicator of social status for younger generation. With tons of advertisements involved in every kinds of medias, people tend to spend their wealth on artificial things more and more. For instance, I experienced with a few individuals saving over a half of their monthly income to be able to purchase a high-end watch.\nAlthough having converstions about money might help people to understand deeper about money management and how improve themselves to get higher wage, this could lead to overspendings which could have a huge negative effect.\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that a widely used of social media and advertisements of luxury products are two major causes of a rising in popurlarity of talking about money. On one hand, the situation can help equip people with better knowledge about money management and self-improvement. On the other hand, daily discussions about money has a potential to raise an importance of external artificial objects.",

    "essay": "In modern society, most people believe that money is as important and indispensable as water. As a result, in many countries, people talk more and more about money, such as how much they earn or pay for things in everyday conversation).\nThis phenomenon, I think is a negative development. And I have three reasons for this:\n1. Inner hypocrisy;\n2. Lack of confidence in oneself;\n3. Thinking and vision.\nFirst of all, the inner hypocrisy. Many young people like to talk to their friends about how much they earn and how many expensive things they buy. At the college reunion, everyone should introduce himself or herself. For example, what kind of work he or she is doing now; Recently bought a house and a car somewhere, and then has to recommend it to others. The core purpose is to say \"I've made millions in just a few years and bought a house and a car.\" Although they look nice on the outside, they are empty inside. Therefore, the inner hypocrisy is because they are empty in their heart and have nothing else to compare with others. They can use the money to make up for and satisfy their inner emptiness, and only in others can they find their sense of existence, recognition, and attention to themselves.\nSecondly, I am not confident in myself. Many elderly people like to chat about their children while playing cards under the community pavilion. For example: if your child is married; How much does your child earn in a month; Did your child buy you anything expensive? If you answer in the negative, you will be looked down upon, even saying, \"Your children are working such long hours for so little money and they don't buy you anything nice.\" These people often talk about it because they are not confident in themselves and they know that their children are inferior in abilities and other aspects. In other words, they are uncertain and reckless. So they like to show off in front of each other and want to prove themselves and their ability to each other.\nFinally, the thinking and vision are not high. Every country or place has different classes of people, such as those living in rural China and; Paternal (they all lived in the past); on the surface look good in every way, but only after material things. Because they think money is the most important, money can do a lot of things, and only money can give them a sense of security. As can be seen from this, a person's circle of friends and living environment can determine a person's thinking and vision, so, only if your surroundings are positive, can attract more positive people like you.\nIn a word, if a person always talks about money, it shows that he is hypocritical inside, not confident in himself, thinking and vision are not high. So. Be sure to constantly improve your thinking and vision, constantly improve your ability in all aspects, and even keep positive at all times, so that not only can attract more people like you, but also your future life will be better.",

    "essay": "It is a face that people love to talk about money such as income and price of things in this modern society. In my view, there are some reasons in both physical and mental aspects, and it will bring about negative effect if it develop deeply.\nMoney is required when we live in this society while we have limited ability to earn money. Therefore, realistically, all of us cannot avoid to count our money when we spend it. Also, in macro view, the government also care about it. the figure of GPD issues every year for measuring wealth of a country. Populace pay attention in it not only because of the international state of a country but also because of the welfare of people. Regarding mental reasons, people generally think that the ability of earning money is related to the success of their life. Moreover, people like competition. So we always compare our level of income with our friends or companions.\nHowever, I think that this is a negative development when people deeply concentrate in it. First, I do not agree that money is everything. As a human being, embodying \"freedom\" is the highest value in our live. So I believe that accomplishing the mental achievements is more important that physical target. Otherwise, people will become heartless because they think that money is the only criteria for measuring how useful of a human. For example, we can help and take care of others as volunteers without any payment, and turn the topic of conversation from money to life.\nIn summary, Although money is necessary in our daily life, it turn us to be ruthless if we cannot control it well. So we can do some meaningful events with our friends rather than talking too much about money.",

    "essay": "In recent years, in some countries, including Japan, some people believe that governments should cover all tuition fees for students who are willing to study at university. Although the total cost will be massive and the governments need to increase the tax on citizens, I strongly agree with this opinion.\nTo begin with, it is absolutely unfair for students who need to give up going to university because of a lack of money. In Japan, they need to terminate to pursue their study at university, there are many students who study diligently though. If the government supported them financially, those who terminated their study could have continued studying and had the great job opportunities they hoped for.\nIn addition, some developed countries have been suffering from depopulation so there are some industries, such as IT, and Civil engineering that chronically have a problem with how to improve the shortage of employees. If governments encourage students to study these industries at university for free, the companies will be not only helpful to increase the number of employees, and also effective for students to obtain some qualifications in advance in university. This\nmeans that the companies do not necessarily spare longer training time than usual for new employees.\nFurthermore, economic growth is linked inextricably with education. If all students could have a variety of courses at university for free charge, they will be able to obtain skillful techniques and plenty of knowledge to pursue their career opportunities regardless of age. In addition, they will be able to study with working at the same time with light-hearted such as nighttime courses, and weekend courses. If they could work and study flexibly, they will obtain more creative ideas to improve their work. If they are required to pay more tax due to the education fee by governments, they are more than happy to pay the tax for themselves and other ambitious students.\nIn conclusion, the free education system in universities must be advantageous to improve their countries' economic growth in the long term.",

    "essay": "Regarding the suggestions that governments should offord the tuition subsidies to cover the cost of full classes, I could only partially agree due to various drawbacks derived from policies as such.\nTo begin with, higher educational levels is essential for young individuals in poor families reverse their situation, not only for themselves but for their families. In this case, governments have obligations to ensure the right of them to pursue higher education without the financial concerns. For example many university students nowadays have more than one part-time jobs since they need to support themselves financially, which left no time for them to concentrate on studies.\nOn the other hand, despite free ethic education could benefit a great number of students in need, the huge costs to maintain a functional educational institution should not be overlooked, by removing tuition fee in universities completely, it could derives various downsides, including lower quality of education and slower progresses of local constructions and developments caused by the shortage of budgets. Take the UK as an example, private schools are able to provide more educational materiols and professional educators, compared to public schools, which have high tendency classes, and outdated teaching equipments.\nTo summerrise, in my perspective, the right for students to study in universities is crucial, since it could not only cultivates talents who are able to contribute to societies, but allows them to bring their families out of poverty. However, people should not be ignoranced for the negative affects derived from removing tuition fee entirely, such as poor quality of teaching. Therefore, I could only partially agree with such opinions.",

    "essay": "This essay agrees on the need of that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities, but always under one premise: those students should have demonstrated their capability to comply with university studies successfully.\nThere are countries, for example Scandinavian countries, where their government helps students by giving them specific students' loans. These loans have special characteristics such as long loan terms and low interest rates. It is not for free, but at least a higher number of students can have access to upgrade their studies.\nAnd in many other European countries university fees are not large, so most of the students can access to bachelor studies. What it's not easy is having the needed qualification you need to access to the specific university study you want.\nIf we talk in worlwide terms, university studies are limited to wealthy people.\nIn fact I read only a couple of weeks ago that only a 17% of worlds' population have university studies. There is a contradiction between developped and non developped countries. As an example, in most countries in Europe we have too many university students. Actually they cannot find a job easily at their own country and sometimes they emigrate to another country in Europe or outside Europe. Furthermore vocational workers such as plumbers, waiters or receptionists can't be found, there no unemployment in vocational work!.\nThe opposite happens in non developped countries. As university studies have large fees, almost nobody can access to them, and vocational workers suffer unemployment, so they need to emigrate to other countries to find jobs.\nTo summarize, I believe fees should not be an obstacle to study in a university. The obstable should be your previous califications.\nEducation and Health, as much as a country can hold them, should be available for all population, poor and wealthy, with non differentiation.",

    "essay": "Education is an important requirement for students establishing their future, thus there is a considerable debate about whether the government should give fully supported payment for university courses to people who want to study at there. In my view, I partially agree with this statement because this is a beneficial scheme, but the selection of scheme participants is required for filtering those who really need this assistance.\nOn the one hand, it is a definite good plan for those families are low income. A completed bachelor's degree course may cost over 10 thousand dollars. However, some grassroots families are hard to afford it. So they may tend to not study at universities but find a job for earning money. After that, college may lose some potentially intelligent students. Therefore, if this scheme can be implemented successfully, those students will show their ingenuity and get higher academic achievement, finally giving back to society when they succeed.\nOn the other hand, this scheme is not suitable for everyone. qualification checking is needed for choosing someone who truly aspires to an opportunity to study at college. For example, setting a line indicating the limit of the monthly income of a family is a way for the government to distinguish who is needed to help. Because the cost of the study is also a type of \"inspiration\" for students studying harder. If a family was proven to be able to afford the fees, the government would not give assistance to them in order to avoid abusive use.\nIn summary, although this scheme is advantageous for low-income families, revealing their children's inherent power, the government can set some rules for filtering those who are necessary for help.",

So having great public schools to fundamental level, enable all students to been accept or get the approval for any univerties and even to requires a schoolarship, when it is necessary. Governments shouldn't spend public money in graduation or higher level education, in order to keep all efforts on be the number one in fundamental education.\nAnother public politic which may shows a good results is provide a specials credit lines for students who haven't enouth money to pay full tuition fees. These type of credit might create a sense of responsability and encourage students to loooking for a good job as soon as they've concluded the course. This kind of financial should consider that payment only starts after the end of their course.\nIn conclusion, I would argue that having the government paying the fees for university studies isn't looks to be a good solution to guarantee an university access for whole population. States should keep investing and execute their role to persue the best fundamental public education and might enable their students to get into any university.

I would say that I strongly agree with this statement.\nTo start with, the cost of course fees nowadays is much higher than it used to be a decade ago. One of the biggest problemss for school leavers is to manage to collect a huge amount of money that is needed in order to enter the university of your dream. Of course there are some scholarships that are very helpful. But the problem is that they are only available for very talented students who scored only high grades during their educational process, or for those who come from low-income families. As the result, students who have passion and necessary skills can not afford to study in the university.\nOn the ohter hand, paying for everyone's course fee would lead to a huge hole in every government's budget. The possibility of free studying for everyone sounds naive and kind of impossible. Another problem is that those students who are more likely not to participate well during their studies and might drop off the university after the first year will have an opportunity to enter universities. This will likely lead to problems with whole educational system. The only solution is to select wisely whether this or that student is ready to spend his or her time studying new knowledge and skills.\nIn conclusion, paying for course fees is a good idea but only for those students who have enthusiasm for studying",

Discuss both views and state your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
    "essay": "I partially agree to the opinion that hosting an international sports event has positive effects for the country. In most cases It is good for the country as it gives a chance to show off the nation's culture and power, but sometimes the cost of holding the event outnumber the benefits from it. I will break down my opinion here with the examples of Seoul Olympic in 1988 and Tokyo Olympic in 2021.\nSeoul Olympic was held in 1988 in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. It gave the nation great chance to advertise its prosperity. Many audiences got deep impression on how the country erected from the ashes of Korean war. In addition, the event had an important meaning in diplomacy, as it was an Olympic game that all communist and capitalist countries gathered after a long time. The event was prepared firmly, as South Korean knew how much this game was important to them. South Korea can earn lots of reputation, as well as money from many foreign travellers\nOn the other hand, Tokyo Olympic was held in 2021, in the middle of pandemic because of Covid-19. It was originally planned to be held in 2020, but postponed because of the danger of mass infection. This delay costed a lot of money to the hosting country. In addition, there were many problems in preparing the event, because of the spread of the disease. Moreover, only small amount of travellers can visit Tokyo to see the game, because of the tight regulations on travel to prevent international transmission of the disease. As a result, the money earned during the game was much less than the cost to prepare it, and its advertising effect was minor.\nAs we can see in these two cases, hosting an international sports event can be good in some cases, but it can be wasteful in other cases.

Most of all, how well the country is prepared is a key factor that the event can be successful.",

    "essay": "Some people believe that arranging worldwide sports is a nice idea for the country and it will give some benefits, while others suggest that is an awful idea. From my point of view, It is a brilliant idea for the country and for citizens when they host and are owners of international sports events.\nOn the one hand, arranging a sport event is always hugely expensive. In democratic societies there is always a doubt if these expenditures are appropriate or not. Sometimes it could be thought-provoking about spending this money on charity, medical insurance or to reduce juvenile delinquency for example. Also, there are people who are not fans or spectators, for them this kind of expensive event is not interesting. For instance, in Russia it is a fact that the winter olympic games in 2014 had a lot of controversial ideas about whether it was really necessary or not. I remember that in that time were a lot of discussion in TV and in the internet,\nOn the other hand, when your country hosts an international sport event it is a nice chance to show how rich your country is and express solidarity in your society. It is a fact that events like this, for example \"eurovision\" or \"olympic games\" and other worldwide events help to create an interconnection between countries and cultures. During these events we can see what happens in other countries and how people there live. For example, in 2018 Russia hosted a world football games, and this event invited a large number of foreign specialists and investors.\nIn conclusion, although hosting international sport events could be very expensive, the benefits which it could give to the citizens and to government institutes overload any disadvantages. I believe that each country should try to do it more.",

    "essay": "People hold different views about the benefits of hosting an international sports. While there are little advantages for some countries throwing such a sports event, I am convinced that holding an international sports event benefits the hosting country.\nOn the one hand, there are several reasons why in some situations people think it is bad for a country to host an international sports event. In the first place, average people draw more attention to daily necessities and medical treatments. They believe hosting such an event is of little value compared with basic infrastructure and amenities. Instead, they hold that if invested in economic development and recovery, the good effects will be doubled. Presumably, if a country , like Afghanistan and Iraq, host an international sports event regardless of its capacity, the country will lose its people's faith because after a war, people all want to fill their belly and want the famine to be eradicated.\nOn the other hand, throwing an international sports event can be a great means of developing a country's economy. Hosting an international sports event spurrs the economy and provide large quantities of employment for people, which revives and thrives all various industries. Apart from that, a sports event held by a country advocates the theme of health and sports, encouraging people there to lead a green positive attitude towards life, as well as setting up its renowned international position. Therefore, after the event, excellent businessman and geniuses all around the world will be attracted to invest there.\nIn conclusion, I can understand why people are unwilling to hold an international sports event, but it seems to me that more advantages of hosting one event like that outweigh than that of not conducting one.",

    "essay": "It is believed that the same punishments should be equally imposed on juvenile delinquency and adult crime. In my opinion, children should be responsible for their crimes, yet according to the severity of their actions, immature criminals should be punished the same as adults or not.\n\n \n\nOn the one hand, in the case of petty crimes such as robbery or fighting, I argue that young children should be punished with more lenient sentences. This is because they are too young to be fully aware of what they have done or to control their aggressive emotions. Therefore, instead of being punished in the same way as adults by being sentenced to 1-year imprisonment, youth criminals should be punished with community service. By doing so, they can compensate for their wrong acts as well as be deterred from reoffending.\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, in some serious crimes such as murder, I strongly support the view that the same punishments should be imposed on juvenile killers. It is undeniable that this kind of offence is extremely serious and leaves long-term implications for the victimsâ family members. Besides, killers pose a threat to the security of society, so they should be sentenced with heavy punishments regardless of their age. For instance, a Vietnamese teenager still received capital punishment due to the inhumane nature of his motives and the way he killed the whole family. In other words, with serious crimes, strict punishments can act as a deterrent against would-be culprits.\n\n \n\nIn conclusion, I hold a firm belief that the punishments that youth criminals should receive should be based on the severity of the crime. While juvenile offenders who commit some petty crimes should be punished to a lesser degree, serious crimes such as murder should not be reconsidered no matter what age killers are.",

    "essay": "Unemployment among young people is an ongoing and increasing situation in many countries around the world. The fact that students cannot find jobs after graduation is the cause of certain complications and can be addressed/solved/tackled/resolved using several methods .\n\nTo begin with, there are a huge number of issues related to young jobless people on a personal as well as community level. Firstly, in terms of finance, young people cannot generate income unless they have a career. Becoming financially dependent, they can face a lot of difficulties in maintaining their daily life. Also, they may become a burden to their own family, especially their parents who have to work harder and harder to cover their expenses instead of enjoying old age. Moreover, workless people are one of the reasons that make social evils more serious. A person without a job usually spends most of the time doing nothing, which makes it easy for them to engage in wrongdoing such as robbery, theft, and drug addiction. \n\nTo minimize and partially solve this problem,  education for the younger generations as well as government action are the most important. First of all, schools should equip students with practical skills and organize career orientation sessions for students. By doing this, it can be easier for them to find jobs after graduation. Also, motivating and encouraging students to participate in vocational training after leaving school for both studying and earning an income can help ease the problem. Furthermore, the government should promote the operation of local career and job placement centres. The activities of these centres should be propagated so that young people can easily access more job information.\n\nIn conclusion, unemployment among young people today is a serious situation and affects both themselves and society as a whole, but this can be tackled with proper education from schools and assistance from the government.",

    "essay": "Some people consider that leadership a skill inherited from ancestors. Conversely, others claim that coaching can be formed through experiences in life. Therefore, from my point of view, captaincy is a balance between gifted abilities and developed capacities.\n\nTo begin with, to be a chief demands some skills given by nature. First, a successful head is a person who can attract people. It means that their tone of voice is strong, fully powerful, and reliable. In addition, a leader needs sharp characteristics, a business mindset, and a far-seeing ability. Therefore, they can make decisions that benefit their business or country. Take Donald Trumps as an example. He is a businessman, according that his personality is extremely sharp. When he became the American President, he helped the United States back to the number one country in the economy, compared with China.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a few comments that leadership can be learned and trained. Because, nowadays, the programs to change an ordinary person to a leader are very popular. They can access the Internet and find an appropriate course such as communication skills in front of a crowd, people management, etc ... Through these studies, future managers will shape the skills that talented people possess. However, to become an expert, they need to practice persistently.\n\nTo sum up everything that has been stated above, in my opinion, if a modest person wants to be a leader without having any innate skills, they could also achieve their goals through hard learning and training.",

    "essay": "âSome believe that people are naturally born leaders while others feel that   leadership skills can develop. Discuss both views and give your opinion.â  Introduction  According to people perspective leadership is a god gifted quality that cannot be learned but that peopleâs  perspective and nothing in this world canât be learned with dedication and repetition.  Leadership is an action not a position. The matter of fact is that the practical meaning of leadership is far   different from theoretical world. The bookish language will assist you for sure but to be a great leader, a  person should hold two qualities courage and persistence along with hard work and that leads him to   enormous victories.  In my opinion if a person has this god gifted quality and yet does not utilize his true potential in terms of   leadership that means he runs his own life by himself and on the other hand if a person aims to change he   will ;indeed.  ââMan cannot remake himself without suffering for he is both the marble and the sculptureââ  There is an example of leadership qualities of Nelson Mandela who always think for the next generation, never focus election. He always motivate his nation, and picked his nation from the darkness to bright   future, he always talked about rule of law and never broke any law.  And for those who think that leadership qualities can built actually they were talking about politicians and   politicians always show-off their activities just act like leaders but they are not leaders and they not have   leadership qualities, they always focused just on the next election to make people fool. The best example  of such type people of is Nawaz Sharif from Pakistan.  That applies to the fact that if you are desperate enough to attain heights of success then for sure you will   attain. This then ends the contradiction that leadership is a quality people are naturally born with, with   dedication anyone can learn the art of leadership, coming to the conclusion of my essay.  Leadership always born naturally the their qualities are GOD-GEFITED but peoples can also learn a lot Good Qualities as leaders have, with the passage of time.",

    "essay": "Many are of the view that control is innate, rather than cultivated through time and experience. In my opinion, leadership is largely more developed rather than gifted.\n\nOn one hand, those who presume that there are naturally born leaders whose traits are fixed size. There are certain individuals who exhibit a natural personality and unique character of expertise. To be a leader, it demands certain natural skills, full of energy and strong personality to take the lead. All these traits help the ruler to manage, to gather people together and, also, to inspire and motivate them. For instance, Balaji Singh, Canadaâs president natural born political leader who inspires many people with his boundless professional abilities, charisma and display astounding skills. Therefore, being sociable, charisma and having strong traits are important natural skills for being a chief.\n\nOn the other hand, great direction is more thoughtful than impulsive. There are many individuals possessing all physical characteristics of a leader who are successful and inspire people. An instructive example of this is Balaji Singh. Early in his career, he inspired people with this exceptional talent, but, that had its limits as he pushed and degraded his political members ultimately leading to his removal from his own party. This mortifying experience led to softening the sharp edges of his character in the subsequent years by considering the others perspective and giving opportunity to other competent associates. These learned traits served him well when he was re-elected as president of Canada and reached what many believe as the apex of administration.\n\nIn conclusion, some people are born as leaders while others become rulers by their choice through cultivating it. Natural skills can be achieved by practice to a certain point, when the physical characteristics take the lead.",

Whilst certain individuals claim that this might pose a threat to the juveniles, other people share a contradictory view.

While relocating to different countries for improved job opportunities can enhance the financial well-being of parents and family budgets, it is often the children who are most negatively affected. To cite an example, establishing relationships at younger ages is a pivotal milestone for juveniles which needs to be accomplished successfully. As families move through different geographic locations, children too are obliged to adapt to their new lifestyles according to the new cultures, friends, and environment. Consequently, every detachment from the previous location and friends can drive children to be depressive and sometimes suicidal due to the inability to cope with the erratic changes that are occurring in their lives.\n\nOn the other hand, disruptive change is one of the most important factors that foster an environment of steady growth even among juniors. Some people  advocate for  constant exposure to  change and agility to experience as much diversity as possible by travelling to other countries.

I strongly disagree with this statement. \n\nthese days robots have many benefits for human lives for example there are bots that help us heal our mental health , choose things that suit us the best ,learn new things with their help ,or even answer all our questions and do many of the tasks that before them they would take a lot of time and energy from us , for instance chat gpt is a bot that can solve many of your problems and you can ask any question that you want and in some way it will give you the best answers and make you save more time. \n\nanother thing that leads us to have these negative mindsets toward robots is the effect of fictional movies, series , books etc ,that displayed robots as villains or creatures who destroy humans take control of the world and start to do evil things for example there is a series called west world which the story is exactly about how bad robots can be .while us humans should be more thoughtful and see the positive effects of these equipment on our world. \n\nto sum up , except for some workers who have been replaced by robots literally, we can only see benefits from this technology that helps us every day to raise the quality of our lives.",

    "essay": "Athletic competitions are perceived to be educative to adolescents by some but others debate the are solely disadvantageous. On one hand , teenagers are challenged to develop their skills only in these situations and on the other hand, they begin to grow seeds of jealousy and rivalry. I think it causes more misunderstandings among team mates.\n\nIt can help team mates nurture their individual skills by playing in the midst of one another because at this age, most of them learn better in the company of their mates. A pubertal boy or girl who loses a game will put in more effort to do better in their next challenge and this follows an upward trend of growth and development in their education of the importance of outdoor activities. For instance, my nephew who is used to showing off his football skills, only started intensifying his training when he lost his first match.\n\nThe declaration of one person as the winner and the other the loser in an organised game could begin to make colleagues see each other as rivals, who are solely after the downfall of  each other. The problem is in these settings where people are considered competitors, teenagers are put under pressure so they begin to focus on showing off and outshining the other or in winning and gaining recognition and not in the level of training and experience they can gather from the second person. For example, my niece slowly started wishing for her friend to stop showing up in practice because when she was around, this meant she will not score more points in volleyball.\n\nI think there are more disagreements and it takes away from the importance of sports and makes us focus on unnecessary things that can foster disunity. There are many terms that ought to be met in every sporting activity and a competition draws attention to these trivial issues allbecause one person wants to succeed and not the other. An example is how often the winning team is considered a cheat and how the losing team is seen to be the victim of such unfairness.\n\nIn conclusion, while the improved performace of any athletic teenager will depend on the number of competitions they have been a part of, it could also breed hatred and contempt. I think there will be more quarrels in such situations.",

    "essay": "Even though people are very busy with their jobs as well as studies, they may experience a longer commute time.some people state that travelling long distances for work or study brings negative effects on them while others hold the opposite idea.In my point of view, it depends on the outcome of one's career commitment.In this essay, both views will be analysed to draw a conclusion.\n\nOn one hand, most people struggle to make their goals realistic despite the challenges they face.For example , as good parenthood, people try to take their children to school in cities rather than in countryside in order to provide them a student-friendly environment and better facilities for education.Also, people immigrate to town areas for services like supermarkets, health care, shopping complexes and public libraries regardless of time they consume to reach and return.Moreover, individuals who concerned about their careers,always try to identify more trends than issues in their job field and promotions as well.As a result,though the public spend long duration in travelling,they receive better outcome for their commitment in return.\n\nOn the other hand,longer commute times cause more stress in people.For instance, if somone faces a traffic jam on the way to his job, he mentallyÂ  struggles with the time taken to reach the work place.This causes him an emotional damage.As well, when returning home, everybodyÂ  wishes to arrive early to their destination and women reschedule the rest of the day for house hold dutoes and plans for tomorrow. If it takes much time to travel, people may get tired easily and fed-up with household activities.This is an emotional burden.\n\nTo sum up, apart from the mental disturbances, most of the public manage all those tasks enthusiasticallyÂ  to achieve their goals.Therefore, long commute times do not always negatively impact the community. However, if the distribution of resources takes place with equal strength across society and if globalization positively affects rural areas as well, a better tomorrow will emerge.",

    "essay": "There is a common belief that individuals are influenced by several advertisements not solely on their regular commutes but also frequently on the internet in their lives. There is a more persuasive argument that these advertisements negatively result in citizen's awareness and their routine activities.\n\nMany think that businesses and companies are abusing the internet or technology advancements to raise their brand's recognition, promote their products, and increase sales. If residents see advertisements many times on their social media sites or in daily life, it will build up their consciousness and values progressively. Therefore, they will have a tendency to judge or accept the products' profit as what they have witnessed before. For instance, Coca-Cola has advertised their brand new Coca-Cola Zero drink, which contains nearly 0% sugar in particular net weight in a soda can, as they revealed. As a result, these customers consume more and more Coca-Cola goods, though it still severely affects their health, as it is the amount of carbohydrates included. \n\nHowever, I am of the opinion that companies may cater to numerous pessimistic consequences to society through their advertisements. When businesses want to boost their goods and expand their prestige more than other rivals, they invest in media or create many junk advertisements. Thus, these can make people feel inadequate and disturbed by spamming commercial videos and organizing many marketing campaigns. For example, YouTube ads gained payments from entrepreneurs to previously show clips of advertisements whenever videos are played, causing poor user experiments and feedback. Furthermore, they can influence our thoughts and decisions, resulting in adverse outcomes such as environmental degradation and superficiality.\n\nTo sum up, while it is apparent that publicizing announcements is strongly changing people's perceptions, it is undeniable that these ads negatively impact humankind.",

But unfortunately,  technology has a bad impact on communication skills and in society way. Moreover, there are people who have strong beliefs in the first opinion in a contrast there are people who see that the negative point is more than a good point.\n\nMany people  strongly believe that the future depends on  robots and that in future will not be any person working  only robots will work. In fact there is community have started taking this step as China now a lot of restaurants have replaced the polite with robots, and they are trying to make robots look like  humans so that children can accept the new change in the world . In another instance now with the new generation of Artificial intelligence (AI) as CHATGPT or PEO getting new information is  easier also you can do the homework and a great presentation with only one click . The negative stop in this is that people lost their advanced search skills and their ability to think  about what was happening around them . \n\nIn contrast on the another hand , while there are a lot of good impacts there are a lot of bad effects of improving  technology . Despite the long distance , people can communicate with their family and friend whom they are away from them but this impact  society , because meeting in  real life makes the connection between them  better in contrast with online .

Although technological advancement can aid in accomplishing tasks that humans cannot do, I think that it will give rise to theunemployment.\n\nOn the one hand, machines have the ability to go beyond the radar of where humans can reach. This comprises some challenging sectors like mining or working in countries with harsh weather conditions. Furthermore, the usage of machines can mitigate any kind of the risks involved with the human body. Moreover, artificial intelligence can help to detect information at a high pace compared to the human brain. For example, many low-wage workers from Nepal who work in the Middle East countries lose their lives due to extreme weather or falling off from a height. Hence, to  safeguard the lives of people, robots can be an alternative.\n\nOn the other hand, robots, if offered as an alternative, will take away the jobs of the public. Due to extensive technological upgrades, not only the white-collar employees, but all kinds of workers fear losing their income. For example, Naulo, a Nepali restaurant, has robotic waiters. This influenced other restaurant owners too as it attracts customers. As a result, waiters protested against all this strategy.

Many deem it to be a worthy addition to our lives, but contrarians to this notion believe that, it can prove detrimental to our society. In this essay, I will ruminate on both sides, before making my statement.\n\nThose  who consider robotics to be vital for the advancement of civilization, do so by observing several quality-of-life changes brought by it. Such as, the integration of rudimentary assembly line machines used for product manufacturing. Moreover, there exist self-driving cars, waiting to revolutionize methods of transportation. Additionally, there have been major strides in the development of life-like androids. All in all, the future seems bright indeed according to these supporters.\n\nHowever, trepidatious ones vouching against this technological progress, do so by witnessing drawbacks brought by these gizmos. Like, mass lay-offs caused by the introduction of automatic tools in many factories around the world. Furthermore, these people do not look favourably at the idea of automation in vehicles, as they are wary of hazards associated with it. Also, they hold fast to the belief that, there will come a day when automatons will completely render human talent superficial. As an example, the advent of artificial intelligence art (AI art) has filled artists around the globe with dread, as they think that they will soon be replaced by their man-made counterparts.\n\nTo conclude, In my opinion, both views of this argument possess merit.

Some say that they should not be allowed by the government since they have an adverse impact on society, while others believe that they are used for calming. Although movies and computer-based games are considered the best sources to reduce our anxiety, in my opinion, people become violent and aggressive.\n\nFilms and games based on fighting help to reduce anxiety. That is to say, people feel stressed after studies and work thus after playing these games and watching fighting movies, they feel relaxed. For example, many individuals in India play PUBG after work to reduce their workplace stress. However, in opine that, people should find other sources to reduce their anxiety such as interacting with their close ones.\n\nOn the other hand, many individuals develop aggressive behaviour due to these games and films. In other words, individuals do what they watch, therefore, if they would watch and play aggressive games and films then they might become the same. For instance, there had been a rise in cases of aggression-based crimes in India after the release of PUBG. Hence, I believe that these entertainment sources should be banned as they have a negative impact on society.\n\nIn conclusion, violent movies and games are becoming popular worldwide, some say that they should be banned while others opine that they reduce tension.

Robotics is now a field that is not unknown and the spike, we are seeing in its implementation is something huge. Today, robots are present everywhere whether it is at home as your cleaner and vacuum or in the operation theatre as surgeons' assistants. However, the opinions on it are quite the opposite. Some believe that it is the best invention in the history of mankind while some believe otherwise. I opine that its benefits are weighed higher on the scale as compared to its drawbacks\n\nTo begin with, robots have taken the world by storm through the outcome and  their performance. The first and foremost advantage is it has never been so easy to solve complex problems as it is today. robots have the innate ability to do various tasks together and to provide accurate answers. Secondly, they are now sharing the workload of human beings by performing various levels of  work thus providing them with  a sense of relaxation. For instance, many surgeries are now performed by Da Vinci which is a specialized robot to assist surgeons and in this way, half of the burden has been reduced.\n\nOn the other side, there are drawbacks that should be taken into consideration. One of them is the industry will soon be converted into an AI-driven workforce and as a ,result millions of people will be jobless as e!employers will prefer this one-time investment instead of paying an amount every month to the employee. Another thing that is alarming is the lack of power to change decisions timely. These electronics work on the installed and manufactured intelligence therefore they do not have the capability to switch their mode according to circumstances. For example, if a robot is teaching a class that is not disciplined, it has no power to process how to keep children motivated.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that in spite of a few deficiencies, it is going to help human beings in great ways in the near future . All we need to understand is that these creatures can take up our responsibilities but can never give us  emotional support. So, use the robots but stay connected to the people",

    "essay": "It has been frequently argued that spending leisure time gaming on the internet is worthless, whilst others opine it has assisted in the overall progression of young ones. In this, essay I would like to shed light on both perspectives along with my viewpoint in the upcoming paragraphs. \n\nTo begin with, developments in technology have altered the ways of spending free time as well, however, a few masses are against the over-utilisation of electronic devices by children as it is dangerous for them. Initially, they have been suffering from serious health issues as they do not perform any physical activities that could lead to obesity, subsequently, accumulation of fat is a fundamental cause of fatal diseases. Besides, it has adversely impacted the eyesight of operators due to long screening hours, therefore, they have to wear lenses or spectacles at a young age. For instance, these days, the majority of kids are observed suffering from immense eye problems. Moreover, an addiction to playing video games restricts them to concentrate well on their important tasks, in fact, they are frequently scolded because of receiving poor grades.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the masses assume playing computer games has brought ample benefits in the life of youngsters. Firstly, while operating  games, there is a great involvement of concentration and the neurological system of the brain, consequently, such children are quite intelligent. Secondly, they obtain valuable experience by using technical gadgets and these are helpful for the rest of life. For example,  kids could conveniently get white-collar jobs in the Information Technology sector and earn well by doing work, which they like the most.\n\nIn conclusion, parents are worried about their young ones as they spend their whole day merely sitting in front of their laptops, which has been deteriorating their physical health and wasting their valuable time. Although, a few masses consider it  useful as it plays a vital role in the upbringing of children and it assists them to get good jobs. In my opinion, the use of any device more than needed is harmful and a similar case is here, the users could obtain more benefits by using gadgets within a limit.",

People have different mindsets. The subsequent paragraphs would shed light on both approaches before making the final note.\n\nOn the one hand, there are a multitude of reasons why individuals think that business and cultural trade is advantageous. The most significant reason is that this helps in exchanging the things that are not available in one country. The tea leaves for example are not grown in England so they obtain these from India. In this way,  other countries are enjoying things that their countryâs climate does not favour. Besides this, cultural contact plays an indispensable role in increasing the countryâs economy. To clarify, some countries offer different countries to visit them during the different festivals or events organized by them which result in people travelling in and out of the country and increasing its economy as when people travel they spend a lot on their stay and food. \n\nOn the other hand, I favour those who opine that this is destructive as it destroys the nationâs identities. The first and foremost reason is that when people exchange happens people tend to travel to other countries, where they get influenced by the culture of that country. So, to adapt themselves to those people they try to change their way of living according to that country. Due to this, they lose their culture and identity. For instance, almost 60% of Indiaâs population has travelled to Canada and has been living according to Canadian culture and forgetting their roots. \n\nTo conclude, although the points in favour of the former view are substantial, I still opine that because of this contact between the countries, they are losing their identities as a whole.",

So, there are two different kinds of view as follow; the one is that shipment times can have detrimental effects on human beings, and the second is that longer commute times do not have drawbacks. Although there are so many benefits in working and travelling long distances to your workplace or studying institutes, I side with the first opinion.\n\nFirstly, transportation imposes a great deal of money on the national budget, and every day millions of people use public transport so governments have to disburse money and it is not financially justifiable.  However, by accumulating  money, authorities can provide job opportunities or progress to elite universities. Having provided career opportunities, governments can disburse  eco-friendly vehicles, and subsequently, they prevent air pollution which appears by transportation.\n\nSecondly, physical pain paves the way for mental disorders so, by travelling far distances, people are about to be frustrated. Consequently, frustration can make a lot of family conflicts, and it can affect their life  a group of problems will be appeared in the family such as family breakdowns and children's upbringing issues.\n\nFinally, it is said to immigration to the cities has increased in last recent decades, and it is due to better accommodations and facilities which are currently provided in megacities so it has a detrimental effect on our rural life. For example, our industries which rely on rural districts will be damaged and a great part of our domestic product will be decreased. Accordingly, GDP will decrease, and it hinder sustainable country progressions.\n\nIn conclusion, although there are so many benefits to working and studying in prestigious associations, it has lots of drawbacks to consider such as wasting the national budget, mental disorders, and destroying rural lives and industries.",

My view is sports games are very crucial for children's lives.\n\nTo begin, playing physical competition can improve their ability to control emotions. Firstly the sense of winning will bring happiness and of course, they will learn how to be happy and overwhelmed with joy in a modern and ethical way. Secondly, if they lose youngsters can take a chance to taste the bitterness of loss and how to control that. Kids when they play basketball,football or tennis games, for example, either win, lose or get an equal score.\n\nsports activities can develop their personality in the future life by discovering their ability, and limitations besides that their weak points.For instance, young football players train four times a month to be able to complete the whole match.\n\nPart of some nations have different thoughts although it's just games they said they have a negative impact on youth.

Many believe robots are crucial for human development whereas some argue they have a negative effect on society. This essay would discuss both  views with empirical evidence and conclude with my opinion.\n\nTo begin with, artificial intelligence is one of the greatest milestones achieved by humans. They can be used to study places which are inaccessible to humans. For instance, the world-renowned rover Curiosity, was sent to Mars for a detailed analysis of the planet's features. Without robotic technology, it would take another decade to achieve this feat. Hence, this technology plays a vital role in the development of mankind.\n\nOn the other hand, robotic machines have replaced men in many jobs. For instance, in many food and packaging industries, programmed machines are used as they are more efficient and fast when compared to a worker. Furthermore, a robot can work for long hours without any breaks, thus increasing in productivity of a company. This scenario can lead to an increase in the unemployment rate causing a detrimental effect on  society.\n\nTo sum it up, robots have a pivotal role in  future development and the need for them is inevitable.

However, there is  more persuasive that artificial intelligence is a very dangerous invention that could have negative effects on society. \n\n    On the one hand, Robots can help humans in dangerous activities. It helps citizens to raise production and work performance in a short time. People can use artificial intelligence to contact, manage and control their job. For instance, after the 20th century, engineers always use robots to check many problems in nuclear factories and toxic locations where humans should not come into. The AI can control precise employees and manage money for the big bosses.\n\n    Nevertheless, Nowadays, humans are more and more dependent on machines. Robots can make a lot of workers  lose their jobs. From that point, it is making society's vices and no one lives in vice city. In fact,  research shows that 80% of employees will lose their job in the future and the government ask  employers to comply with labour laws and control robots and let humans and machines work in harmony. Do not allow AI to replace humans in some important fields.\n\n     To sum up, while it is apparent that helping with activities is one-way citizens can support  their lives and jobs, it is undeniable that humans are the main deciding factor, not robots.",

    "essay": "Some people commented that the best way to enhance folk medical problems is from soaring game infrastructures. However, others believe that this advancement would lead to an insignificant impact on individuals' health. Personally, I advocate the second view opposing the first since industrialized food and tightened work schedules are behind this. Although, these furnishings could contribute significantly to boosting their lifestyle. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view and provide evidence to prove the arguments.\n\nOn the one hand, industrialized meals are responsible for crowd medical issues. In other words, these days people consume factory-based meals like hot dogs, and sandwiches, which are not  healthy diets, it leads to a plethora of clinical diseases such as obesity and heart attack. Let us take sugar as an example, the World Health Organization recommends only a teacup spoon daily, that said, 90% of Women and  Men eat three times more than the quantity endorsed. As a result, a myriad of them has high cholesterol leading to illnesses. \n\nOn other hand, sports infrastructures shrink people's work stress. Because of high demanded jobs, individuals need public facilities to warm and exercise to relax. 60% of full-time employees were found out  relaxed after spending a day per week in gyms, according to the University Zambeze overhaul carried out last year for instance. Hence, workers were more encompassed in their employment and  soared in profits. Furthermore, it is seen as the overriding reason for reduced hospitalization for supporters of the idea.\n\nIn conclusion, notwithstanding some benefits coming from sports settlement, it does not play a relevant role in folk lifestyle because lately what they are eating does. Therefore, I still believe that the quality of individuals' food defines their medical condition. I recommend ruling power economize financial resources that should be used to construct these facilities to allocate to other social projects.",

    "essay": "Basic education plays a critical role in everyone's life. These days some people think that there are benefits in going to private schools and others feel that public ones are better for overall development. In my opinion,  government institutions are much better as students will get a chance to interact with diverse family and cultural backgrounds.\n\nPrivate secondary schools are more focused to maintain education standards. This type of facility ensures that all the learners will study hard to have good scores in the board exams. However, getting admission to these institutions is pretty hard as they conduct an initial test to match students' knowledge bar. Because of these standards, most of the crowd wants to raise their loved ones in a private facility.\n\nOn the other hand, some people think that limiting the environment can cause a negative effect on  learners. In basic education, children need to have exposure to  diverse curricula for better social learning. People also feel that public institutions pay an attention to both mental and physical development. Moreover, these places don't require a lot of admission fees and provide opportunities for all types of families to get their children educated.\n\nTo sum up, I think private secondary facilities are more focussed on one area which may limit the learning of children. On the other hand, public organisations provide a better ambience where students can learn, play & make new friends irrespective of their family background. However, money also plays a vital role in an individual's life in deciding a learning place for their children.",

    "essay": "These days there is no doubt that a great number of films and games is increasing quickly. While video games and movies are played by many ages, some cases show that these activities cause negative things including violence. Therefore, this essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of watching movies and playing games.\n\nOn the one hand, movies and games are common activities to do in their spare time because they can make people relax from work and study. Those who watch films at the cinema or play games in front of a computer screen may enjoy the plots and adventures as well as reduce the excessive social pressure, therefore they will feel fresh and energic to face their daily activities. However, sometimes society finds actions which are inappropriate, showing porn or word harassment. These definitely are harmful to people ,especially children.\n\nOn the one hand, sharpening critical thinking and creativity is beneficial. Due to the fact that players must finish and solve the missions in games, they will involve their knowledge and experience to deal. Earning more money from gaming live streaming which many teenagers do for a living today is another positive result. Moreover, their behaviours are often influenced by what they watch and play so  it is possible younger people have a bad attitude as same as many people in online games.\n\nIn conclusion, people can gain many impacts from films and games in society either positive or negative. However,  parents can minimalize the negative results by making some rules for their children and governments should involve  legitimate  policies related to the issue, prohibiting cruel conversations and banning films and games that have the possibility to harm the citizens for instance.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, violent video games and films are extremely demanding among all age groups. while some people believe that these are detrimental to societies, others assume they are harmless and relaxing. Both views will be discussed in this essay.\n\nTo begin with, some families are worried about the harmful effects of violence shown in movies and games on people. They believe that people are more prone to act cruelly in real life by watching brutal scenes frequently. Therefore, these films should not be available to be seen worldwide. Exciting music and visual effects are usually added to violent acts making them more addictive and as a result, people will be more likely to watch or play similar films and games next time and will get used to them. I agree with this view since research has shown that the crime rate is much higher in societies in which people have unlimited access to brutal scenarios.\n\nOn the other hand, some others do not consider violent pictures harmful. This group state that virtual goings-on has not any impact on the individualâs real life and that playing such games is relaxing. They think adults watch these movies to be distracted from everyday lifeâs stresses and get the energy to back to work. Personally speaking, I disagree with their opinion because I am sure people will be impressed by violent scenes unconsciously. \n\nTo conclude, although one view is that watching bloody movies is an amusement, I believe it might have deteriorating effects on community health and it should be banned.",

    "essay": "Some individuals believe that robots contribute towards humans' collective progress while others argue that they have a negative impact on the society. On the one hand, robots can be used to automate repetitive tasks. On the other hand, they reduce the employability of a significant portion of the population.\n\nRobots are now used on an experimental basis to perform certain repetitive tasks. These robots are designed once and deployed with the intention of reducing the mundane labour hours of the task force. A primary example of this is how chatbots have been used to reply to frequenty asked questions at customer service. The chatbox thus helps to reduce the overwhelming volumes of calls that the customer support team receives as the employees can now focus on the more specific cases that require human attention.\n\nIn contrast, the usage of robots can eliminate the necessity for certain work forces. This will lead to a reduction in employability. If an individual has a limited skillset that can be performed by a robot, the indiviual becomes an easily replacable resource.For instance, robots can now be used to perform labours such as vaccuming or washing the dishes. In such cases, a house helper who previously used to work on these household chores becomes redundant. They will have to re-skill themselves to be employable.\n\nIn conclusion, robots will be a necessary aid in reducing the mudane work hours in an employees career.Employees who fear losing their jobs can understand the pulse of the market and re-skill themselves accordingly. The society should welcome this change as a milestone towards humans' progression.",

It is often argued by a substantial proportion of individuals argued that AI is extremely essential for humans. However, others opine that the invention of automation has a negative impact on the community. This essay will discuss both views as far as I am in favour of the latter notion.\n\nTo commence with, several industries are making their own self-working humanoid robots because machinery can effortlessly do hard work without any problem. Videlicet, Artificial Intelligence is many huge companies already make their own machines such as Amazon, Google and Meta. Therefore, they are firing many employees from the brand.  For example, more than two-fifths of numerous manufacturers are using mechanical personnel because it consumed less time and does effective work in their field. Thus, Bionic humans have many advantages.\n\nIn addition, the fact cannot be denied that computerized people have several disadvantages as well. Workers are replaced by AI because it is doing good work and many programmed humans are reading the actual human brain. For instance, the cyborg is extremely intelligent it is programmed by professional coding. They can effortlessly read the human brain. According to the Japanese authority, they made one robot named Asimo. After a few , the year they learn from many natives such as flirting, nudity and sexual chatting and the robot is sending many atrocious things to the women. As a result, automation is extremely harmful to residents. \n\nTo conclude, unquestionably, a cyborg has many benefits to the brands and population.

In my opinion, private secondary schools are better options than the public ones. \n\nAccording to some people, students should go to private schools. Generally, the level of education in those schools are higher than the others. Most of the time, private schools hire the best teachers to educate students. Those teachers also have high salary. That is why they are more keen on to work with students and try to share all of their knowledge. According to statistics, majority of the secondary school graduates have better job options and high incomes. In a nutshell, students from private schools have more chance to live in better conditions in the future.\n\nOn the other side, private education centers are expensive. People from poor families rarely have a chance to study there except some distinguishable students who get a scholarship from various organizations. Because of that, many intelligent and diligent students do not get a chance to study there. I know many people from my experience that their child was very clever, but because of their financial limitations, their kid did not get a proper education.  To sum up, people should carefully consider  private school costs before applying.\n\nIn conclusion, some people believes that  private school is a key to the best education but some thinks otherwise.

They usually provide a good learning scheme for their student, the pupils will be guided in more intensive ways to learn and adapt the knowledge compared to government secondary schools.\n\nHowever, the government secondary school is a place that all parents will afford to send their children.

    "essay": "The phenomenon of the effects of robots technologies development has aroused wide concern among various circles. Divergent as people's views on the issue in question may be, I believe that it is more beneficial for humans in the future.\n\nOn one hand, some people think robots will take their job away because the expenditure on robots is noticeably less than human salary. For instance, the basic cost between machines and human has dramatically different. Machines only need fuel and time-to-time maintenance, but a human requires much more, ranging from housing, food, and clothes to transportation. It reflects a company's spending on machines and humans respectively. As a result, some people strongly reject the development of robots.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe that automatons can bring us a more wide range of benefits. One of the advantages is that they can work in dangerous environments such as clearing the wall of tall buildings and deforestation. This will in turn prevent the accident occur. Another reason is better shipping efficiency with lower prices, it is beneficial to most businesses these days. For example, automatons shipping can run 24 hours a day which means the period of delivery will be decreased, and the price should be able to cut off half of the original shipping cost because it does not need to pay salary to a machine. Therefore, many people feel that robot development can bring us a better future.\n\nUnder this line of thinking, although there is a good reason in favour of the argument that robots are dangerous inventions for our future, I believe automatons development would replace us to finish the most basic work and allow people to live their own life.",

The proponents of this technology believe robots would play an important role in our future endeavours, while others believe it may have some adverse impact on society. I agree with the former view and this essay will discuss both views with more emphasis on the former. \n\nPerhaps the most important use of robots is that they could perform highly risky tasks such as bomb disposal and firefighting. They are more agile and can withstand extreme conditions that are impossible for humans to bear. In addition, they can work round the clock without complaining or restrictions. Teller machines and robots used in manufacturing industries are good examples of such continuous work. With the developments of artificial intelligence, every piece of equipment is embedded with a certain amount of intelligence making them more versatile and useful. \n\nOpponents of robotics raise two key issues against their wide use. Firstly, they express their concerns over the employment problem as robots would take over many jobs currently performed by humans. One such area of great concern is driverless cars which would deprive millions of drivers worldwide of their livelihood. Added to this problem will be the issue of computer viruses or going the control of robots into the wrong hands. This kind of malfunctioning or disruptive act would undoubtedly have disastrous results. However, restructuring businesses to offer more job opportunities to people in a technological era and a protective mechanism for the control of robots would mitigate such mishaps. \n\nIn conclusion, robots have useful as well as potentially harmful effects on society.

Besides, there are many mixed opinions, some people think that music has a bad influence on young people, but there are many people who do not think so. I personally think that music brings many positive things to young people.\n\nFirst of all, the current music trend is increasingly diverse such as hip-hop, jazz, rap,etc. Young music trends prefer songs that are vibrant and cheerful, not like the music of the next generation. before. However, there are some songs that use inappropriate language or MVs with images that are not suitable for all audiences.

This will adversely affect the music market of the country as well as the young people.\n\nOn the other hand, the music industry brings a lot of value to young people as well as the face of a country. Music is one of the methods to help people easily express their feelings, and convey the emotions of the singer to the listener. It makes it easier for people to get closer to each other. Besides, when a song can reach the international market and be accepted by many people, it will also help promote the image and traditions of that country to international friends.

To explain, Many high standards living halls will provide a qualification for their students because it will be encouraged learners' knowledge and it helpful for their nation's economy. For example, In Australian news channels reveal that headlines 89% person students all around the globe learn in their own private institute because it has well developed in their society.

For instance, In the USA lawmakers decided all schools are free for poor people because some families' growth will be not financially good it will impact  their public environment. Thus, Personal schools will don't have a negative outcome on their society it reduced  education common for all human beings.\n\nIn conclusion, Although private institutions have an important role show for educational purposes has a bad impact.

However, this has become a controversial topic, as a part of society argues that sport is a vital aspect of education. Opposing this is the view that physical education as a subject is unnecessary. In this essay, both of these opinions will be discussed and a conclusion will be drawn.\n\nOn the one hand, sports activities are considered to be detrimental to the studentâs educational outcome as less time and money is allocated for academic subjects. In other words, should physical education be mandatory, students will have to devote a part of their time for studying to it, simultaneously, schools may invest money in sporting equipment rather than teaching one. This ultimately results in students not having the best academic education. Another argument is that, forcing students to exercise in school when they do not want to can lead to negative experiences and memories connect to it. Henceforth, sports are leisure activities that are not school-related and therefore should be practised outside of school.\n\nMeanwhile, physical education was introduced into curriculums as a means to promote a healthy lifestyle and ensure every student gets access to regular exercise and its benefits. For already active students, sports lessons might be redundant, while those who come from sedentary families largely depend on schools for exertions. Furthermore, physical movements can help alleviate the stress of theoretical sessions and promote better concentration and efficiency.

One of the biggest reasons is that poor individuals could not buy new models because technological assets improve fastly day by day, but other people believe that automation can compound both poor and rich populations. I partly agree with this statement because both sides have justified thinking. Both of these viewpoints will be outlined in detail before concluding with my opinion. \n\nTo begin with, most societies can not earn enough money to buy technological appliances in many countries. For instance, although everybody wants to have a new iPhone, any person who has no money can not buy that. While rich societies use new applications for their high-quality phone,  poor societies can not. and hence, the range between rich and poor classes is increased. \n\nOn the other hand,  improving technology prevents discrimination between populations. Because everybody is the same on the internet. For example, in the past few, days Justin Bieber -a renowned singer-sang a song in the metaverse. Normally, if the metaverse didn't exist the public who are dying to watch him have to give money. Therefore there is no difference between poor and rich. In my opinion,  hi-tech provides many various opportunities for all humans and also gratis. \n\n \n\nTo sum up, the range of technology currently available may be looked at negatively by few individuals because of the increasing gap between the poor and the rich individuals but actually, it has many different benefits.",

In the following essay, my contention will be further scrutinized.\n\nTo begin with, it is widely known that the forms of art change constantly in order to adapt to the development of the era. This is because ,in  different specific time, the theme of the civilization is different which leads to different demands of people. Besides, art is a reflection of the characteristics of The Times. An eminent example of this is in the Renaissance era, many masters changed their painting or writing styles from praising the god and the church to celebrating the greatness of people such as Raphael and Michelangelo. Therefore, in  modern society, more and more informative technologies are invented and the fast pace of  life gives people under much more pressure than before. So watching some violent pictures can release stress and help people adapt to this fast-changing society.\n\nHowever,  some conventional opinions say that too much violence is not good for peopleâs mental health. To illustrate this, on some occasions,  individuals who are obsessed with  those kinds of film or computer games tend to have a propensity for violence. This will contribute to more crimes and cause social instability. Moreover, without too many restrictions, teenagers can easily find the resources for  violent films and computer games. This will definitely influence their mental health due to their immature mind. Thus, it is important for managers to implement some measures and policies to partly limit peopleâs behaviour especially setting some limitations for the youth.\n\nIn conclusion, after this essay has manifested the above-mentioned points, I can reiterate that I believe that watching films and playing computer games which contain violence are trends in this society and can help people relax. But these behaviors must be under control, otherwise, there will be more crimes and bad influences on peopleâs mental health.",

    "prompt": "Holding international games like the Olympics games is an exciting events. Some people thinks it has positive effects while others think it a waste of money. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.",
    "essay": "These days humans are becoming crazy about numerous multinational events. A section of society holds a notion that conducting foreign games have many advantages for the domestic countries, whereas, critics negate it and believe that it leads to wastage of hard-earned money. Although both aspects hold their own significance, my inclination is toward a former viewpoint.\n\nTo begin with, there are many reasons for discouraging such events. To start with, a huge investment is needed for its proper execution. Since hosting nations must spend enormously for making these programmes successful. Due to that, funds approved for other assignments like education and the social welfare of  society could be used for making the event a grand success. For example, in India, in 2010, Commonwealth games were hosted wherein, approximately Rs 2000 crores were spent on its execution by utilising funds from other areas as well. Secondly, there are extreme chances of misappropriation of funds during this period. As exorbitant amounts in the hands of a few would certainly lead to corruption and misutilisation of the allocated budget.\n\nOn the contrary, there are myriads of advantages of hosting international events. Firstly, it may assist in promoting the tradition and culture of the domestic nation. Particularly, all the events start with the welcome and ending performances, societies mainly plan traditional events during this time to show to masses their rich culture. For instance, while organising the commonwealth games in 2010 in New Delhi in India, a national anthem was always played before the start of any event, followed by a domestic cultural event. Furthermore, it will also benefit the nation by boosting  revenue. Though people from far-off places pay a visit to cheer for their teams consequently, tourism increases in the home nation, which will automatically pave the way for the influx of more income in the surrounding.\n\nTo conclude, even- if planning an international event demands bulk investment, in my opinion, factors such as promoting revenue for the whole community, besides showcasing rich cultural values to the foreigners plays a prominent role in the overall development of the nation. Hence, these programmes must be promoted for the benefit of society.",

    "essay": "Some people argue that family plays a crucial role in children's development. Others believe that television, books, etc., are the factors that can affect a child's growth. This essay will discuss these both views and argue in the favour of the prior.\n\nOn the one hand, When children watch their favorite comic character, they tend to imitate that character. Moreover, the reading of books can also influence the child's development internally. Along with that, the nature of the friends with which they are roaming is also very important that can play a vital role in the development of a child. For instance, children can follow and try to enact their favorite comic character.\n\nOn the other hand, Family is a pillar in a child's development journey. From the birth of a child, when they were in adolescence they learn qualities of their parents or family. When they habituated to bad habits.Furthermore, parents are always present in their life particularly at this stage.For example,children who are from broken familes they have high chance to exhibit delusional behaviour.\n\nAn emotionally safe and secure surroundings are also important for children.Additionally, Parents also teaches  children about setting boundaries.\n\nIn my opinion,children's choice of books,music, or friends depends on the values instilles in them by their parents.Therefor, parents hold more substantial sway over their offspring than media, pop culture and friends circle.\n\nIn conclusion, the outside world influences the intellectual and social development of children.However, I believe that it is parents who set the stage for these developments by laying a strong foundation from a very young age.",

However,I quibble from them and put forward my idea that public health is more effective and it increase the number of sport facilities.\n\nHowever,thae public in general tend to different view that public health have less effective and need other to improve the facilities which has multiple reasons. To start with some people counter that all people should have been healthy for any kind of sports, because health is more important in our daily lifestyle. To increase any type of health issue the facilities plays major role in any person life. The more facilities for any kind of workout help the people to get easily and can get motivated by the equipment. To insist, the gym play major role in public so people can go to gym and become healthy and fit person.\n\nThe subsequent evidence are obtain to prove the concept of public health should increase the number of sports facilities. The top notch rapid factor if public will be healthy and fit so they can play any sports, and facilities regarding the sports will also increase. If public will be healthy they will get less deases in their body. For example, If public want to become more healthy the facilities in gym will increase and sports also get more people. So the country also get affected. Thus, it is clear that public health can increase the sport as well as sports facilities.\n\nTo conclude, there are innumerable strong factor supporting the public health can increase the sports facilities, it's opposite also cannot be overlooked or controlled.

    "essay": "Over the years, technology has played a prominent role in making informed automated decisions for various spheres of livelihood. There's an ongoing argument that some people think robots are important to the human future while others think robots have a negative effect on society. This essay will take an exhaustive look at both views and conclude with my opinion.\n\n      Robots are important to human features because of the reduction of the cost of human labor it will offer. Many organizations will reduce the usage of human resources and wages/salaries being paid in carrying out various job functions because of the digitalization and automation being offered by robots. For instance, for construction companies construction at the site will no longer be done by various human beings but rather done by an automated creature that will be built based on the role needed to be performed by it. Robots, undeniably will make work easier for different entities on the planet earth and save the necessary cost.\n\n     On the other hand, robots will lead to so many unemployed human beings on planet earth. Many human resources will become unemployed due to the fact that the necessary functions to be carried out by human beings are being done by an automated resource. For instance, chefs in a restaurant will no longer have to cook or prepare a meal for any guest, this will be done by a robot once an authorization is given which may lead to complexity. Undoubtedly, robots will make a person less active and unemployed on planet earth.\n\n  Conclusively, robots will make life easy for various individuals especially the business owner, and also make so many individuals jobless in society because of the alternative given to carry out their various job functionalities. However, it is invariably safe to say that robots are the future of society, especially because the world is embracing technology and its offerings which have helped in the automation of various business processes and its portfolio.",

    "essay": "It is worth noting that health problems are haunting the general public, both physically and mentally. Though many assert that installing more sports equipment could tackle this issue, others, however, advocate that we should find other solutions. I concur with the view that governments and colossal organizations together should take more responsibilities.\n\nOn the one hand, there is no doubt that constructing extra sports facilities could enable citizens to do more physical exercise, hence, leading to a healthy lifestyle. With the increasing pace of life, modern city dwellersâ schedules are largely occupied by sizeable workloads, they often need to do overtime or do shifts even at the weekends, making doing sports extremely time-consuming. Had more gyms been introduced, folks would have been given more access to exercising.\n\nOn the other hand, it is fair to say that more efforts should be made in order to improve folksâ physical health and mental well-being. Despite sports activities, other aspects with respect to public health, namely food security, air pollution and waste disposal, should also be addressed fundamentally. For instance, the higher prices of sugary foods could refrain peopleâs purchase desire, giving rise to fewer sweet food lovers and accordingly declining the overweight population in the long run.\n\nFrom my perspective, I strongly believe that authorities should make more efforts to ensure our people can enjoy a good health condition. This is because only the entities like governments and colossal organizations have the power to implement large health projects. For example, they could introduce mandated control on the scale of trans-fat foods or ask factories or education institutions to provide better and cheaper access to nutritious foods, therefore boosting citizensâ fitness.\n\nIn summary, from what has been discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that in order to improve peopleâs physical health and mental well-being, introducing sports infrastructures alone is not efficient, thus more contribution from authorities and other entities is needed.",

    "essay": "Many people like playing computer games or watching films with violent plots in our  modern society. The issue about whether or not these should be banned because they are  harmful has triggered heated discussion. In my view, although there are potential harmful  effects on people , restricting this kind of recreation is better than compeletly banning  themit.  On the one hand, people those who are oftfen exposed to violence in films or virtual games  are more likely to simulate these violent behaviors, especially the youthsyounger people.  Becuase Because young people often don't do not have the a matured worldview, if they  watch more violent scenes in entertainment, they may think that violence is a good way to  solve problems or be a heroattain a high level of status. For example, more than twenty  years ago, while when many Hong Kong movies containing violence were introduced to  ourinto Chinese society, the rate of violence among teen-agers increased  evidentlydramatically. However, such instances are rare exceptions and most individuals  who watch violent content do not imitate these actions.

    "essay": "In the recent past, the gap between the rich and the poor countries has widened. While some believe that assisting the poor till they are financially stable has positive consequences, others contradict. I think world organisations should continue their support to these nations until these zones are removed from this category.\n\nOn one hand, there are many developing countries that lack proper infrastructure for basic amenities. Thus the space between them is increasing. The major factor for lending support is to build good governance and rules within the zone, which help them become independent later. For instance, a few regions do not have sufficient food, good shelter, schools, organizations and enough resources for everyone, though they form an essential part of everyday lives. Apart from them, catastrophes, for example, droughts, floods and tsunamis, which take away many people's lives, cause the damage. Additionally, they deserve the assistance, for all of them need to be on par with each other, or else they would be in a vulnerable situation of being invaded.\n\nOn the other hand, many argue that the world organizations such as World Health Organization, UNESCO, and UNDP form a bias towards the poor ones and tend to have an inclination towards only their betterment. However, these states too delegate their responsibilities to these organisations by depending on them too much. The more international aid is provided, the more the countries rely on it. In addition, more funds are directed toward them. To illustrate, today, a lot of funds are provided to Syria as it is one of the under-developed ones, therefore it leads to a reduction in the funds towards the global causes.\n\nTo conclude, there are more benefits if international institutes lend a helping hand to them than the disadvantages. So I opine that the aid should not be stopped till they prosper to a considerable extent.",

    "essay": "Violence on television programmes and in video games is at the forefront of national debates. Many individuals assume it has serious detrimental consequences for society, while others refuse to this notion. I believe frenzy on TV and digital games adversely affects our society as it develops desensitized culture.\n\nOn the one hand, exposure to violent TV shows can have crippling effects on society. Those who watch a lot of violent shows have a hard time empathizing with victims of violence. People become desensitized to violence over time, which may lead to them becoming excessively accepting of violence and less uncaring toward victims. According to a new study, many people have reduced blood pressure and pulse rate in response to real-life depictions of violent events after watching a lot of violent TV series. Violent shows also make people think about being aggressive. As a result, our society's equilibrium is disrupted by these vehement displays.\n\nOn the other hand, this phenomenon may have any influence on the manners of humans. If they are able to notice it was sinful and have the ability to control their minds as well as their action, they can walk over these temptations. Moreover, that violence on television and games sometimes reflects the other side of the society, which is the dark one. Therefore, it may build up sympathy with the people who are suffering from the brutality. \n\nIn conclusion, humans get impact from what they see and watch, regular exposure to violent content certainly has a negative impact on people and communities, but sometimes we can avoid the demerits of it if we have a clear point of view. To make society more peaceful, I believe the government should restrict the content of prime time entertainment and video games.",

To explicate it, the grown-ups learn many lessons at this age and they remember it for their whole life. Moreover, at teenage people set their goals and work for them In which experience is an accessory. Teenagers not only mature at that age but are also responsible. to cite an example, The New York Times newspaper showed that the humus who took experience at the younger ages now become  successful people. as a consequence, it is quite clear that experience in the teenage influences the life of people in future.\n\non the other ,hand a plethora of masses think that knowledge at an early age is pivotal,  however I think it is not a good thing because children are immature and they don't have thinking ability. They can easily forget  things.

    "essay": "Some people would argue that robots are imperative for the future and enable people to save more time; however, some think robots negatively impact society and make people less social. Although robots may have made people technology-dependent, I believe that the quality of work will improve and be error-free with robotics.\n\nOn the one hand, using robotic technology, people become more dependent on machines and lazy. People spend more time watching TV or browsing the internet rather than doing their day-to-day work as robots work for them like a robot vacuum cleaner. As a result, people become more reclusive, less social, and lazy and will potentially get into several health concerns such as obesity and overweight related health diseases.\n\nOn the other hand, some people believe that robots enable people to work effectively and provide error-free results. Robots are programmed which minimize the errors humans usually can make. That degree of error can be minimal, like a typo error or massive during some surgeries, which can be fatal. In my opinion, I agree with this viewpoint as robots minimize mistakes; therefore, one can save time and energy to rectify the error. For example, recent research found that humans perform some surgical procedures that take 5-8 hours; when experimented with robots, scientists found a reduction in time by 1-2 hours with almost zero errors.\n\nIn conclusion, although robots make people lazy and less social, I believe robots save time and minimize human errors; therefore, they are beneficial for the future.",

This essay intends to discuss  both views and I will discuss my opinion in the forthcoming paragraphs.\n\nThe reasons why people believe watching tv has benefits on children. Firstly, children have a hectic schedule, they spend the most time in  school and later they have to do homework which had given by their teachers then spend some time on tv by watching their favourite show gives them relaxation from the study. Secondly, many education programs telecast on the tv and watching the right kind of shows increase knowledge. Finally, some children decide their career by watching sports, food, music, and arts from the tv program. For instance, most sportspeople choose sports by watching their favourite games. Therefore, Virat Kohli is one of them and he is the greatest cricketer in  history.\n\nOther individuals have a negative point on this. They say that children become lazy and couch potatoes by spending the most time in front of the television and the ratio of the obesity problem in the children are increasing every year, in spite of this their eyesight become weak. Further, many violent and vulgar shows are broadcast on tv, which affects them mentally due to this they develop some bad habits at an early age, later this becomes a great problem in their life.\n\nI believe that watching tv has an advantage for  toddlers. They learn many things from this such as cooking, art skills, sports, and some dance moves. Whereas, it is one of the greatest things to kill boredom in life.\n\nTo conclude, \"every coin has two sides.\" Parents should limit the time of watching television and watch tv with them so that they could not watch some aggressive shows.",

    "essay": "Major international events are fascinating. The city host usually has their once in a lifetime experience as being the worldâs spotlight.  On the other hand, several people tend to believe this leads to unreasonable financial expenditure. As far as I concerned, although International games are overpriced, they are satisfactory to a long-term cityâs legacy. This essay will present a discussion of both sides of view. \n\nFirstly, when a country wins the bid to host an Olympic Games is the chance of being broadcasting worldwide and becoming the spotlight. Media coverage before and during the games is undeniable and this fact leads to an exposure that will bring more visitors. For example, Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic games held in Brazil had increased 40% touristâs visits through 2 years after the Games. Therefore, hosting international events can be remarkable to  economic growth through the tourism industry. \n\nHowever, hosting the Olympic Games can be catastrophic if not well planned. It is crucial to plan a long term and map out all the sports venues on how they can be used after the games, otherwise, several venues can become white-elephants stadiums.  To illustrate this, the Athenaâs Olympics Games in 2004 was an outstanding event, notwithstanding, it was not well organized and most of the arenas nowadays are destroyed due to time. Thus, a plethora of money can be spent when a country receives the bid of a Games and the return of investment can be pointless if not well-planned. \n\nTo conclude, from the arguments presented above, it is inconceivable to believe that financial expenditure does not exist. Nevertheless, there is positive effects as well as drawbacks when hosting any mega event.",

After some local and volunteering's effective activities have started at the beach like picking up trash, helping some turtles to be free from the plastic bag sticking around theirs heads, the scenery has become fresher and more healthy sea creatures have been born there.\n\nOn the other hand, there are adverse thoughts that the only solution to climate change is getting used to it. Consequently to the lack of responsibility, it is complex to convince society to join helping the environment since this is not their only life's issue to care about. The situation is made worse when there is also no sign of government' policies protecting the environment when they are one of the main keys leading to the success of solving those climate issues. For instance, there is a recent report of scientists, which mentions that the government are the most influencing one who could effectively encourage the community to make the environment better. \n\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree with the opinion that climate change should not be ignored and it is high time humans saved the world they living in. I would suggest that the government should step in and launch some environmental policies for the citizen to follow.",

    "essay": "Some people claim that contemporary music has issues on the youth generation whereas others think the opposite and defend the benefits of  to listen music. This essay will discuss both sides of this situation and explain the reasons why music has more pros than cons for  teenagers.\n\nListening music is good for all ages because it can change our mood quick and bring different emotions. The youth people have been overstimulated for many devices and they have had some issues with tasks that required concentration. Lo-fi beats, for example, can regulate the heartbeats and breathing in a way that helps to keep focus on one task for many hours. Therefore, this type of music could be very helpful nowadays with attention disorders, which becomes more and more common among teens. Another beneficial example in the kids is the lyrics because it is a kind of poem with a message behind. For many years, music teaches through its stories about culture, experiences and impressions of the world. Therefore style, lyrics and rhythm are always changing to adapt to the new generation of listeners or keeping memory alive.\n\nOn the other hand, it is not all songs that we can consider beneficial for youngs. In this phase of life, they are still figuring out their characters and personalities and some noise as referred to as music, could not be good for them. For example,  Brazilian funk is very popular among young and teens, however, the lyrics are always incentivizing to commit crimes, rape women and consume drugs. Therefore, if I had a teen close to me, I would never allow him to listen those kinds of music.\n\nIn my opinion, music is extremely good and could help in different moments in life, especially for our kids; but requires the attention of the parents to overseas what type of music their children are listening to.\n\nTo conclude, music has by far and large more benefits than problems to influence young people because it can change emotions or tell experiences, even though some type of music could have a negative impact.",

    "essay": "There are many natural disasters happening around the world as an effect of climate change. Some people suggest that global warming should be combated, whereas others think people should accept the current fact and adapt to changes. In the following paragraphs, both of these viewpoints will be discussed in detail before a conclusion is reached.\n\nSome people think that climate change is acceptable and people should be adaptable to all kinds of situations. In the last few decades, there were different natural disasters happened in different parts of the world such as floods, sea-level rise, the melting of the polar ice sheet, droughts, extreme weather and earthquake which are the effects of global warming that cannot be avoided to encounter in some countries. For example, Japan is a country that earthquakes occur the most, however, Japanese people still live in their country and learn how to live with it. In addition, their houses and buildings have been built with resilient structures to withstand earthquakes.\n\nOn the other hand, many activists around the world try to urge people to stop behaviours that cause the greenhouse effect. Many people contribute finding strategies to mitigate climate change; however, this is unable to be successful without governmentsâ support ; therefore, governments need to deliver effective climate policies such as carbon footprint reduction, clean energy, sustainable lifestyle and so on to all organisations, factories and individuals to be able to follow them in order to prevent the increase of the worse situations.\n\nIn conclusion, people should be adaptable to unexpected natural disasters, in a meantime, I believe that this phenomenon cannot be ignored and allowed to get worse in the future by human behaviours. Both government and individuals should take actions to tackle this problem and mitigate carbon emissions to order to make our world the best place to live.",

    "essay": "It is considered by many that people should do their best to lessen global warmingâs effects, but others believe that we should get used to living with it. I think, despite  being the irreversible effects that global change brings about, we exactly seek to solve this problem rather than accepting.\n\nFirst, without taking precautions, the condition of the world can become  worse or deteriorate by only learning how to live with climate change. Therefore, we should make people more conscious of its effect and take some measures to mitigate it. For example, government and conservation organizations promote people to get about using biodegradable materials instead of using disposable ones such as plastics. Hence, we might contribute to this change positively to be a reversible effect. \n\nHowever, many scholars think that this situation becomes an irreversible matter, which does not help people to stop this change. So, ones which encounter problems related to climate change must get used to situations, resulting in decreasing its harm and damage and thus saving peopleâs lives. For instance, in northern Turkey because of global change towns flood with heavy rain and landscapes occur more often compared to the past. Consequently, inhabitants readjust to new conditions by changing town plans or the location of their houses.\n\nIn my opinion, although climate changeâs effects are rising day by day, this problem only solves by humans. Nevertheless, it comes out with humanâs mistakes, it will simply be sorted out by people. If the government and all people cooperate with each other and people are educated about its adverse effects, I think we cope with that situation.\n\nIn conclusion, even if people prefer to spend their time getting used to the worldâs extraordinary conditions, they must tend to be cared to stop these conditions by being increased their awareness.",

    "essay": "A highly controversial issue today relates to children being too much time on tv and video games is good for them or this implies on not good influence for them . In this essay, I am going to examine this question and explain why I believe the argument of their negative effect on them is stronger.\n\nThere are people who argue that spending time on electronics like computer games considerably outweighs its disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is that the television stimulates their imagination and creativity solving computer games. It is also possible to say that these little daily challenges improve their intelligence as they progress inside the game. One good example here is the increasing difficult in each phase of the Super Mario game.\n\nOn the other hand, others believe that TV and computer activities are passive actions for children. People often have this opinion because since the first months of life up to 10 years old, the children does need to practice physical activities like run, walk, touch new objects. A second point is that their development depends on direct interactions with people and other infants. Their interactions of touching, tasting, smelling, hearing, visioning will have a significant impact on their development while screens will mainly interact with visioning. A particularly good example here is when is compared a child who frequents kindergarten versus a child who does not. The first one usually has more abilities as they interact with others at school.\n\nIn conclusion, both arguments have their merits. On balance, however, I feel that spent time on screens like TV and video games is not a valuable time. This is because the interactions with other human beings have more impact to their early development.",

Meanwhile, the rest of others thinks that poor people in a country should be at the top of the priority list. In this essay, I would discuss the territory economy level and the unwealthy people.\n\nFirstly, by improving the growth rate of an economy we can elevate the living standards of the people by bringing more goods and services to the country. Secondly, the unemployment rate of society is decreased. For instance, we can offer more jobs to underprivileged people by developing a new industry. And to that, we may also reduce the overall expense of the people who are living in the society.\n\nHowever, we should also give equal importance to the less fortunate people. Because poverty is the disgraceful and unjust condition that has always haunted humankind. It divides the people into classes like high class and low class. And it also leads to diversity among the people. so the authority must take effective measures for the people. for instance, an equal educational system for all, scholarships for below poverty line people, or to the first graduate people in a family. \n\nIn conclusion, Economic growth leads to better living standards for the people.

    "essay": "It is widely believed that the uses of the tv, video and computer games might have a positive impact on children. However, some people argue that using these devices might not be beneficial after all. This essay will discuss both these views and will provide my own opinion of the matter.  \n\nOn the one hand, these tools can be used to boost  brain development in children. It has been scientifically proven that some children can potentially learn topics of different subjects by watching tv. For instance,  some tv channels educated kids by showing them programs related to history or geology, thus, helping them become more familiar with it. Secondly, when kids play either video or computer games, they are working out their brain. In other words, some brain' parts need to be active in order to understand the plot and the goal of the game. At the same time, they can acquire new skills. For instance, a study from the University of California showed that kids who played Tetris games can develop better spatial vision in their later life.\n\nOn the other hand, children could be at risk when they spent time using these tools.Â A lot of parents advocate and refuse their kids to watch tv. They believe that there are many inappropriate tv programs showing adult scenes or people having bad habits that can directly influence kids' behaviours. Moreover, there is a great risk of children becoming dependent on these devices. As a result, they spent countless hours indoors, thus, isolating themselves from family and friends. Lastly, there is a high likelihood of children becoming violent when they spent time playing action games. These games can easily influence their behaviours and in some cases, it can even encourage them to be violent in real life.\n\nIn conclusion, these tools bring a lot of advantages for children, as long as they are used in the right way. In my opinion, there should be limits in the use of these devices in order to avoid kids being negatively impacted. In the future, parents should be more vigilant with their kids, checking upon their habits, especially watching tv and gaming.",

    "essay": "A few people believe that playing competitive games by students plays a vital role in their studies, whereas others assert involvement in these activities is not beneficial for the children. I intend to discuss both the views followed by my own opinion.\n\nOn the one hand, advocates of latter view opine that competitive sport can adversely impact the studies of the pupils. In order to participate at a level which requires consistent practice, students need to spend enough time in the field to participate in it. Due to this, they often fail to spend time in their academics, thereby negatively affecting their studies. For example, a child who practices in the morning and evening for sports gets tired and generally skips the classes and self-study hours to recover. This situation clearly depicts the effect on the education of  sports students as they do not get time for studies.\n\nOn the other hand, proponents of the former notion assert participation in competitive sport enhances certain skills which can assist the young ones to imitate these characters in their academic life. To explain, players are not only trained to bear pressure, but also to hold their nerves in any competition by the sports coaches. These qualities are generally required in taking competitive examinations as well, which are not easily provided through teaching in classes. Thus, students who are equipped with these skills through competitive sports activities are more likely to get succeeded in the examinations which require competition such as entrance exam for various prestigious universities and so on.\n\nIn my perspective, sports activities can aid the students to perform better in their education unless they spend a large share of time in the sports field only. It is primarily due to the fact that outdoor activities increase oxygen content in the body, which can make students more sharp and active. This is imperative for their studies because it can help them to raise their concentration while learning as the fresh and active mind is more focussed according to various studies as well.\n\nTo conclude, in my opinion, students ought to dedicate some time to competitive sports as it can help in terms of building character which can assist them in their education as well as refreshing their minds to increase concentration in studies.",

While many people claim that advertising plays an essential role in stimulating the sale of products, others argue that excessive exposure to advertisements creates negative impacts on society and individuals as a whole. In my essay, I will delve into the latter view.\n\nOn the one hand, it must be admitted that due to promoting advertising products, companies can achieve substantial profits. In such an information-driven global market, through publication, the customer from many parts of the world can access the pieces of information and functions of consumer goods. Without advertisement campaigns, firms are not able to enlarge the circle of customers and survive in the fierce competitions. Furthermore, as taxpayers, they tend to make more contributions to the increase in government revenue.\n\nOn the other hand, a part citizen also shows drawbacks of the advertisement industry since it may lead to an unhealthy lifestyle and exaggerate the benefits of certain goods. For instance, the model wears the latest dress with the limited handbag seems to be a shining diamond in the sun. As a consequence, customers especially the young generation become discontented with what they already have and are likely to waste time and money on trying fancy things. \n\nAll in all, judged by a detailed analysis of both sides, I think that the efforts of manufactures to promote their goods are not to blame. Additionally, related laws should be launched to ensure that there is no deception in any advertisement and promote healthy competition among producers.",

Although it is thought that spending time watching television is detrimental for children, some people believe this has more advantages in their development. In my opinion, I strongly consider that media has a negative effect in shaping children's behaviour and character and on the long run has damaging side-effects.\n\nOn the one hand, some people voice that screen time is quite harmful for children, and I agree. In other words, spending a considerable amount of time watching programmes reduces the time that is spent on studies, and as a result, they tend to score low grades in academics. Adolescents, for instance, are glued to television spending hours together, thereby lose interest and struggle to concentrate in their studies. Consequently, they end up with poor academic performance and failing to succeed later in life. Moreover, cartoon and animated series target young children, and eventually affects their health as the time spent outdoors is considerably less.\n\nOn the other hand, it is believed by some that watching useful programmes has beneficial effects on children. One reason why it is helpful is that it gives them quality leisure time from the highly demanding various subjects. This gives them the chance to take their mind out and enjoy some fun time, and also cultivate their interests by watching suitable series. Another reason is that they could relax at the comfort of their home by watching their favourite shows or scientific programs, rather than venturing out, thereby managing time efficiently.\n\nIn conclusion, while people may vary in their opinions, I completely believe that spending time before the big screen has harmful effects on children's life.",

This essay will present both views of this contentious argument and argue why I believe parents' supervision is crucial.\n\nAdvocates believe that television and computer games yield positive effects on young children. Firstly, they emphasise that these pastimes could have a tremendous educational impact on young people. There are various tv channels that offer diverse programmes that go beyond the school's curriculum, and children are attracted to watch and merrily expand their knowledge. My nephew, for instance, views the Discovery Channel to experience the lives of the Amazon tribes. Another benefit is that children can develop cognitive abilities. Online games such as the Civilisations, require to build an empire and battle to survive, and when played in groups, users have to communicate and collaborate to achieve their goals. As such, spending more time on computer games will assist these young group to cultivate essential problem-solving and teamwork skills that are necessary for their adult life.\n\nNevertheless, others highlight the worry impacts of digital gaming and television on young people. Their primary concern is health. Adolescents face difficulty with moderation and they can watch television for 6 hours on end. This will lead them to breed a sedentary lifestyle which results in obesity, diabetes and posture problems. Additionally, opponents contend that spending lengthy hours on screens will stall their social skill development. Games such as Suki are also played solo and the lack of engagement might lead them to be self-centred and less expressive. In this regard, my consent lies with this group as socialisation should be the key ability that needs to be cultivated in their early childhood.\n\nTo conclude, while the educational and cognitive benefits of children playing computers and watching tv are immense, I believe that parents should strictly discipline their children from using these devices as their health conditions may deteriorate and they might not be able to learn social skills.",

While Scientist's from across the globe argue that this is a right time for Artificial Intelligence to start control the world. However, others argue that giving complete authority to the machine can have some serious drawbacks, which will risk human's life at workplace. I strongly believe that there should be balanced automation technology for better future, which human can control if it is necessary. However, I will explain the both sides of the question with examples. \n\nThere is an ample evidence to show that automated machines can produce significantly more amount of production when compare to humans. Which means, automated machine can do 5 people's work in one hour with less manpower. In the same way, R&D departments form various industries providing more employment opportunities for graduates to develop advance machines. For example, economically developed countries like the USA, Germany and UK already deployed automated machines in manufacturing industries. As a result, more production can be done in short time. \n\nOn the other hand, some commentators suggest that too much of automation technology at workplace can lead to serious outbreaks. For instance, machines have no control of taking decisions on their own, unless someone can programme them to do so, mistakenly, if a person is standing at the machine operated location, he can be injured. While recent study from the University of Melbourne states that, if automation technology started expanded, unemployment rate will increase more likely to 25 percent in Australia. \n\nIn conclusion, I strongly recommend that automation machines at industries will provide large amount of production in short time. However, too much of automation will make humans lazier in future. There should be balanced workload where machine and human can do.",

    "prompt": "While some people consider air pollution to be the most dangerous environmental problem, others believe that soil pollution has a more serious effect on our world. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.",
    "essay": "Nowadays, environmental pollution is one of the most devastating impacts of human activities on the Earth. There are four types of pollution, namely, air pollution, water pollution, soil pollution and noise pollution. Some people believe that air pollution is the most pressing problem while others are convinced that soil pollution has an implicit threat. This essay will discuss both statements and give some justifications for why I advocate the former.\n\n   On the one hand, soil pollution consists of damaging long-term effects. Soil fertility will no longer remain if this kind of pollution constantly continues. Inorganic waste and the overuse of chemical fertilizers, which are attributed to the cause of soil deterioration, can affect harmful to local people's health such as cancer from chromium, damages in the nervous system from lead, etc. Soil that has been contaminated should no longer be used to grow food, because the chemicals can leech into the food and harm people who eat it.\n\n   On the other hand, I totally believe that air pollution creates much more detrimental issues. Long-standing impacts on inhabitants' health stemming from air pollution include heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema. Air pollution can also directly contaminate the surface of bodies of water and soil, which will kill crops or reduce their yield. Air pollution will certainly contribute to the greenhouse effect which can lead to a series of environmental problems such as Increase in average temperatures and temperature extremes, polar ice melting, rise of sea levels, etc.\n\n   By means of conclusion, although some people think that soil pollution contains hazardous impacts, I am firmly convinced that air pollution causes more toxic effects. It is vital that governments should do something from now to prevent the development of environmental pollution.",

    "essay": "The computer game industry has an intrinsic role in our daily life. This enormous increase has lead to two opposite opinions on the effects of playing computer games on children. A certain people claim that computer games are detrimental to the youngstersâ health being while a few thinks it has some positive impacts on the childâs growth. In this essay, I will shed lights on these boons as well as analyze the negative aspects of playing games in front of computer screens.\n\nFirstly, the most notable advantages of playing computer games is skills improvement. Playing computer games help enrich the young generationâs reflexion and logical thinking by providing practise in problem solving and tactical situations. In addition, the juvenile are able to meet and strike up a friendship with like minded people and share ideas with them.\n\nDespite those benefits, spending a great amount of time playing games will face climbing rate of deleterious health issues; including obesity, heart diseases and so on. With their leisure time mostly spend on playing games in front of computer screens, the youngsters will lack sufficient physical activities; this lifestyle tendency absolutely cause gaining weight. Furthermore, violent contents in computer games could have egregious impacts on childrenâs behaviour since the young people would imitate the ferocious acts in the games\n\nIn conclusion, no doubt there are some pros involved in playing video games. However, parents should limit the playing time and take a proper care to overcome such issues so that children can enjoy their leisure time.",

However, while many advocates that music piracy doesnât effect on the music industry, I side with those who believe that it does affect the music industry as a whole.\nOn one hand, it could be argued that download music from the internet is not illegal and it doesnât affect the music industry because they have multiple sources of income. Many artists create videos or songs just as a hobby. Likewise, many artists do live shows or advertisements, their main income sources are not just music. Hence, supporters of this claim that download from the internet doesnât affect much to them.\n\nOn the other hand, I hold the opinion that download music from the internet is illegal and it significantly affects the music industry because to make any song is expensive. Many people work behind to make an album and artists needs to pay for the staff, advertisement fees and rent. If people do not buy their album legally, artists will not able to pay them and in the end artists will get bankrupt. In other words, they will stop making music albums and people might lose great artists.  Thus, in my opinion, people should not download music from the internet illegally.\n\nTo conclude, although some musical artists make albums as a hobby or they do not rely on one source of income, Music downloading from the internet without paying for, it causes the whole industry will not survive in the future. Therefore, on balance, I think people should avoid music piracy.",

    "essay": "Some people believe that technological progress these days have increased space between poor and rich people while others disagree with this idea. In my opinion, a large section of machinery is available that decreases gap between poor and rich people. On the contrary, there are novel technological innovations and gadgets that are accessible only for affluent people.\nTo begin with, automation is a powerful issue which has covered the whole world for last decades. As we can see, it is required for carrying out majority of daily and routine chores and all services should be linked with computers and internet. Moreover, for attainment wide ranges of information in different fields, such as universities, healthcare services and other enterprises, technological tools and websites are needed. Owing to this dependency, main parts of automation should be existed for all sorts of people in society that this matter decrease the gap between them.\nOn the other hand, some technological discoveries and devices are merely for affluent because of financial matters. For a sample, there are several approaches of treatments for chronic diseases such as cancers or HIV virus which are extremely lethal for human. These methods include high cost of drugs and emergency cares which only rich people can afford them. In addition, there are some appliances and machines like last update of different brands of Microsoft or car companies which poor people can only dream about them. Therefore, this is the basic reason to increase the space between both types of people.\nIn conclusion, according to the text, using of technology has a couple effects on the community that can declines or increases the gap between rich and poor people because of monetary issues.

    "essay": "A government, whether it is democratic or republic, should aim on the good will of their citizens, have vision to fulfil and responsibilities to carry on. Thus, economic headway is the key to success for a prosperous future. Many, including the regime think that, the priority should be given to ensure the promotion of economy while others disagree with this notion and opine that they should focus its efforts on the progress of  the less privileged. In this essay, we can discuss both sides.\n\nTo begin with, economists  betterment is a policy intervention endeavour aiming to improve the well-being of people.  Economic advance is required to ensure a better life standard for the civilian. For instance, to control the crime rates, corruptions, better hospital facilities, etc. So, it is important for a state to assure the stability of austerity. Without economic stability, an administration cannot ensure advancement in education, defence, healthcare, international trade and social safety. Moreover, without economic success, a country cannot defend itself from external threats, fight with epidemic diseases and cannot ensure proper health care facilities to its inhabitant.\n\nOn the other hand, even though economic prosperity plays an essential part, governments must ensure a better living standard and green environment. They have to pay attention to create a more advanced educational system, business ventures, job opportunities and thereby creating better life standards and comfort and then, the ministry can collect more funds through taxes. The authorities should provide blue sky and clean air to their taxpayers, as their right. Therefore, the hike of the economic sectors should be aligned with other important sectors. In addition, many people would also argue that it is better to bestow a prosperous country to the new generation rather than leaving them a broken economy.\n\nTo sum up, it is undeniable that economic expansion plays an important role in the development of a nation. More than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery. Thus, the officials must consider many other aspects which are equally important. However, I personally believe that besides economic improvement, better education, social welfare, security and political stability are equally important for the sustainable development of a nation.",

Some people insist that it is not beneficial to have many TV channels. Although I understand this point of view, I would argue that widening choices to watch TV programs has a positive effect on individuals and society.\n\nAdmittedly, there are some disadvantages to providing many TV channels. Some people might find it easy to see unreliable news. This is because broadcast might find it difficult to survive in competition as there are so many different TV channels. Therefore, people working in broadcast may need to attract peopleâs attention, using exaggerated information.

Therefore, many people dose their best to get the opportunities. As a result, people can invent different types of TV programs and make high quality of TV shows.

While one section of the society consider this as an opportunity for creating and expanding businesses, others see this as a drawback for them. This essay will juxtapose both these views, and finally conclude with my opinion.\n\nWith the dramatic change in the weather patterns, the tourism industry has been harshly hit. Owing to unexpected rise and fall in temperatures in most of the parts of the world, such as extreme weather conditions in India, where summers are as warm as 50 degrees Celsius and in winters mercury level drops to nearly freezing 0 degrees Celsius, tourists do not prefer to visit such places. Consequently, local businesses and overall economy dependent on tourism gets detrimentally affected.\n\nOn the contrary, few businesses such as air conditioner manufactures, fans and heaters manufacturing companies see this as a good time to boost their business as the demand of their products shoot up due to climatic change and consequently they have to increase the supply as well. Their agenda becomes very clear and their business potentially increases in such conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, though few businesses gain from the climate change, I believe the majority has a perilous effect on them. Climate change is a very dangerous issue which will negatively affect each one of us, even those who are gaining profit from it today. Hence, we all should have a provident approach towards it and be solicitous about our future.",

This essay will discuss why I strongly believe that all kinds of sports should be teach at school. \n\nFirst of all, the main idea behind the sports is that they maintain the body moving. As a result of it, sports make us healthier and happier. Second of all, especially for children these kinds of practice are really necessary to develop theirs muscles, bones, and even mind. For example, if they practiced regular activities more often, such as, soccer, basketball or volley, their health will be improved a lot, also they could live more and more years.\n\nMoreover, working as a team, some young people develop the ability to understand how the world works, while some are the first, others could be the last. For instance, when I was a child, I used to play soccer with my friends during the high school, and it was an amazing experience for all of us, because sometimes we won, and others we lost, but we never gave up. Consequently, this period taught us an important lesson for entire life, that is \"no matter the final result, always give your best\".\n\nIn conclusion, I totally agree with it that there are more pros than cons of teaching competitive sports for children, they could rise mature and being better people, facing challenges no matter how big they could be.",

There are two schools of thought, one believes that competing in games is favorable for child learning, while others think that there are negative consequences. I believe that sports competition encourages the child to be strong, and courageous, however, there are some adverse effects.\nCompetitive sports, such as football, baseball, cricket e.t.c. train a child to analyze, plan and execute. They bring out the best in a person. Children tend to perform better and at a higher rate if they are made to compete with one another. Take cricket, for example, players tend to analyze the goal, come up with a strategy, and try to achieve it. Such sports have a positive effect on child education. Physical activity increases the thinking capacity of youngsters that can be take advantage of during studying. \nOn the contrary, others believe that making children compete with one another can have adverse effects. Every player in a game aims to win, this can put a lot of stress on a young mind that can lead to mental trauma. Moreover, sports focus on winning and not being productive, therefore, a young athlete if losing, tries to use false methods to achieve a goal. As a result, this develops a negative perception among the kids. Furthermore, such sports also increase the risk of injuries. \nTo conclude, I think that competitive sports can have a positive outcome on child schooling as it teaches to perform accurately, not be fearful, and make the most. On the other hand, it also has some negative effects, such as stress and a misconception that a goal is to win no matter what.",

While some people argue that robots might have negative impacts on the future society, I believe that the benefits of the robot are likely to outweigh the negative aspects of it.\n\nOn the one hand, there are two main reasons why it could be argued that robots might have adverse effects on society in the future. Firstly, some people believe that robots will harm the human workforce. The people will be replaced by machines and this will increase the unemployment rate. As a result, many other problems may emerge such as poverty and increased crimes. Secondly, people will become more dependent on robots in their daily life and this may harmfully affect their skills like cooking and driving. So people become less active and this may result in some health problems like obesity.\n\nOn the other hand, I would agree with those who argue that robots will play important positive roles in future society. The first role is that robots could operate in locations that humans cannot reach such as exploration of the outer space. They can act as extended eyes for humans enabling them to look beyond their visual boundaries. Moreover, robots will be used inside human bodies for monitoring their health and undertake surgery. The second role that will be played by robots is the helping of elderly and retired people with their daily life activities like cooking and cleaning. Finally, robots could do normal jobs quickly unlike human beings. Robots don not complain or get distracted or tired. They readily work twenty-four hours and require minimal maintenance.\n\nIn conclusion, there are convincing arguments both for in and against the role of robots in our future would, but I believe that robots will add many benefits to the future society.",

    "essay": "There are approximately 196 countries in the world, each following their own business strategies and a unique culture. It is the duty of everyone to appreciate and respect their cultural diversity in order to maintain peace and harmony across the globe. Increasing trade and cultural exchange between countries has both advantages and disadvantages. Let me discuss both aspects and conclude with my personal opinion.\n\nTo embark with the advantages, trade connection between the two nations promote a smooth and friendly relation among them. It assists in setting up a mutual collaboration and foreign investment in our province, thereby increasing the job opportunity for the graduated youngsters. The country's economic status is greatly improved through these marketing relations and is one of the better ideas in assisting a nation's progress in development. Also, by allowing cultural contact, their diversity can be familiarized worldwide, where everyone can know about the different traditions followed across the globe.\n\nTo view the negative aspects, a country's identity starts to fade through these type of commerce as the other nation might dominate us. For example, the business collaboration between India and China has resulted in loss of former country's identity, wherein most of the population prefers to buy the products made in China. This has greatly resulted in depreciation in value for the native products due to the preference given to foreign articles. Also, there are high chances of some particular culture or tradition getting extinct due to their over  diversification.\n\nBy summarizing the above said points, the advantages overweigh the disadvantages of such business and cultural relations. So I deeply agree that developing trade collaboration can greatly influence the nation's economic level in a positive way other than improving cultural diversity across the globe.",

In the following essay, I will discuss about both views.\n\nOn the one hand, with the introduction of newer and better versions of current technologies, the older models would become cheaper. For example, almost everyone owns an iron, washing machine or a mobile phone even if they are not the latest models with the best options. Also, due to the internet being accessible everywhere, online shopping facilities, e-learning opportunities and social networking sites have no discrimination and are accessible by both the affluent and the poor and therefore decreases the gap between the wealthy and the poor.\n\nHowever, On the other hand, certain cutting edge innovations may not be available to everyone due to their costs.  For instance, certain medical diagnostic scans like MRI and certain anticancer drugs, as well as organ transplants are very costly and inaccessible to the poor, whereas the wealthy people just have to spend a portion of their income to access these treatments and become healthy. Poor people, nevertheless, have to spend all of their expenses on conventional treatments and yet there is no guarantee that their condition will improve.\n\nTo conclude, most of the current innovations decrease the gap between the affluent and the poor, while certain developments make society more polarized. In my opinion, in the near future, most of the technologies would continue to be affordable by everyone regardless of their economic status.",

    "essay": "In recent years, leisure time spent by the younger generation has become debatable. Some individuals share the opinion that time spent on activities such as watching television, playing video or computer games can be profitable while others are of the opinion that these activities causes more harm than good. I am of the latter opinion. This essay will discuss both views as well as state the effects of these activities on the younger generation.\n\nOn the one hand, individuals are of the view that time spent on activities like television, video and computer games are beneficial mainly because these activities keep the youths occupied during their leisure time. The belief is that instead of younger peers joining bad gangs and associating with the wrong crowd they would rather benefit from such activities. Take for instance, a high school student after the dayâs activities join friends in smoking and drinking instead of going home and enjoying a TV show. Thus, itâs believed that such activities keeps the younger generation occupied. In addition, these activities relaxes the mind and body. According to a research carried out by the famous Dr Odumosu Bunmi in the early â80s which suggested that children are likely to excel in school activities, if they engage in activities at home that relaxes the mind and body such as watching TV shows or playing games.\n\nHowever, despite these undeniable benefits I am of the opinion that the cons outweighs the pros. The main reason for this is addiction. Young individuals these days get addicted to such great activities. A research was published by the National Health Institution in 2017. This showed that about 80% of youths are addicted to both video games as well as computer games and about 20% to television. Furthermore, these activities makes the youth very lazy. They would rather than help their society or communities and parents, watch or play video games. These cons have overshadowed the benefits of these activities.\n\nOverall, while there are great benefits such as relaxing the mind and body and occupying time, there are also great consequences. I am of the opinion that the cons outweighs the pros and that youths should instead of watching tv shows and playing video games can engage in other productive activities such as feeding the homeless, cleaning the communities and public awareness of illegal drugs.",

What do you think?",
    "essay": "It is obvious that education plays an indispensable role in shaping future of each individual and the society. Whether students should have the right to make evaluation and criticism towards their teachers has become an intense debate. I am of the opinion that while evaluating may be beneficial for learning experience, it is crucial to maintain the assessment to a respectful and constructive degree.\n\nOn the one hand, allowing students to evaluate their teachers can bring certain benefits. One of those is promoting the student-centered teaching method, which is highly appreciated in todayâs education. As students have the chance to provide feedbacks, the teachers also have the opportunities to gain more valuable insights into their teaching as well as realizing areas which they have to improve. Moreover, constructive criticism fosters a collaborative learning environment. By having positive communication, both studying and teaching experience will be substantially enhanced.\n\nNevertheless, it is worth noting that there are also a few potential drawbacks may occur. This approach can lead to the loss of respect between students and teachers. Reverence and collaborative attitude are necessary in conversation of evaluation. If those are not ensured, it will result in a disrespectful and inefficient learning environment. Furthermore, a number of alternative approaches can be implemented in order to prevent unwanted consequences, namely peer evaluation, professional development programs. By doing this, not only avoiding the loss of respect but also addressing teacher performance issues.\n\nTo recapitulate, while allowing students to criticize their teachers may contribute to a better academic quality, it is vital to strike the balance to maintain efficiency and reverence during the learning progress.",

    "essay": "High school education always plays a significant role in people's life. There has arisen a heated debate about whether students should be give evaluation and criticism about their teachers for better education quality.\n\nThose who support students' right to evalugate and criticize their teachers may claim that students' feedback can help teacher improve teaching. Understandably, there is a significant variations in each teacher's performance, sometimes even an experienced teacher will make some mistakes. Students giving constructive opinions to their teachers can help them be aware of the weaknesses in their teaching and make necessary improvements. A further argument is that teachers can develop better relations with their students who like to express criticism. Students who think they have some say in the quality of education they reveive will also engage more activily in class.\n\nHowever, there is an opposite view that allowing students to evaluate and criticize their teachers may encourage disrespenctful behaviours towards teachers. If some students publicly and bluntly criticise their teachers, such as posting unkind remarks on social media complaining about their classes. As a result, their teachers will be offended losing authority and control their students. What is more, if students are premitted to freely disturb their teachers at class, pointing teachers' mistakes, then the class will be disrupted, resulting in other students being distracted and poor learning effects of all students. \n\nMy opinion is that there is truth in both views. Affording students freedom to evaluate and crisitize their teachers can help improve teaching and motivate learning. However, it will also cause problems of teachers feeling disrespected and class being disrupted. Given these potential problems, it is important that schools create opportunities for students to give feedback on their teachers and classes, such as doing regular surveys and also make proper rules to discourage disruptive and disrespectful behaviors of particular students.",

I believe that allowing pupils to provide feedback to the tutor is unacceptable. \n\nOn the one hand, some institutions encourage their students to encourage and criticise their teachers, so that they can determine the strengths and weaknesses of those tutors. Since students are the ones who have the most access to teachers, they are the best options for the schools to draw an insight of how they can improve their education, and the school can assess the academic staff from different criteria such as punctuality, teaching quality and interaction. For instance, I am an example of this, my school always handed out an evaluation form at the end of the semester for the scholars to provide feedback regarding the study contents, and evaluate how those teachers deliver the contents.\n\nOn the other hand, schools should not ask their students to fill in the evaluation forms, as they do not have the qualification to provide feedback or criticise the tutors. The academy principals and their recruitment team know best which candidates are the best fit for the institute, and the recruitment team went through several rounds of interviews to choose the best candidates to ensure that they can improve  their learning facilities. In addition, since students at this age are still growing physically and mentally, therefore, they often use their emotions to decide, rather than focusing on the details. For instance, a study conducted by the University of London shows that high school students are very emotional due to changes in their hormones. Thus, their emotions influence their decision-making.\n\nIn conclusion, although giving feedback to their tutor can provide insights on how the institutions can do better, the students are not the right judgment in this case, as they do not have the quality to criticise and their emotions often lead to their decision-making outcome.",

    "essay": "While some folks argue that children are inspired to give comments and criticism on teachers to increase quality towards education, other believe that it decrease their respect and discipline in the class. In my opinion, I consider that students can loss their respect and discipline towards teacher, if they are commenting and criticizing to their teachers. \n\nOn the one hand, some people think that to increase educational performance students are uplifted to make comments and criticism on their students. To commence with, students who are new in the school and want to learn something new then they are started to comment and to criticise the teacher. For example, in computer programming class students make comments to their teacher about learning new ideas after the class. Another reason is that teacher can not correct the students what they do wrong. As a result, children are starting criticising to their teacher to learn their mistakes.\n\nOn the other hand, it is often believed that making comments and criticism can lead to lose their esteem and discipline and I agree. First reason is that children, who are behaving badly towards teachers, are hated by everyone from the school. Therefore, those children stay alone in classroom and this lead to them to think bad things. For instance, children who are staying alone in the class always commenting on other students ,especially girls and teachers. Furthermore, those students are making a lots of mistakes in their assignments and exams. Due to this, students are irritated by teacher's words and say some bad comments to them. As a result, they lose their respect.\n\nIn conclusion, while people may vary in their opinion between making comments and losing respect , I think that children do not commenting and criticizing to their teachers because these behaviours lead to them in wrong path in the future.",

I tend to believe that the pupils could not avaluate no one for the following reasons.\n\nThree main factors support the idea of do not give to ours teenagers power to criticize the level of education. The primary factor we need take into consideration is that they do not have maturity to analyse how good is the education which they are receiving. Obviously, the majority of the youngers do not show interesting of studying and they could avaluate their educators with intention to reduce their homework, for example. Besides, sometimes is considered as a good teacher who press the teenagers to be not only more responsable, but also productive in their studies. A third reason for my belief is that with the possibility of to be avaluated by a younger, the profissional could lose the authority over the classroom.\n\nI admit that this action could solve isolate matters with some masters, like lack of interesting in to give good classes or respect for the students. Dispite that, this avaluation could be done by parents or other professional who works in the same school.\n\nIn conclusion, I would argue that could be pretty dangerous for next generations if they can mensure how quality has the education which they are receiving from their masters. Accordingly, it would be generally advisable for parents to be more near of the school to make possible this analyse.",

This encourages, certain ,students to comment on their teachers or even criticize them if they aren't provided with the right education. Many believe this to be true whereas, some are of the view that, it may be disrespectful to the professors and reduces discipline.I strongly concur with the latter and in this essay, I will further elucidate my opinion on the same.\n\nTo begin with, many kids nowadays start pin-pointing the flaws in their educators this hampers the overall decorum of the class and is a disrespect to instructors.Moreover, they tend to make certain remarks about them which can even force them to leave their job as they feel they are not good enough.In addition , in many countries, the rate of the teaching profession has declined over the years because of the treatment they had to face children.\n\nI strongly believe, that giving due respect to faculty should be of utmost importance as they are the ones who help in shaping our future and reach our required goals.Furthermore, if something is clear to students, they can ask the teacher to repeat it once again at any point in time and they are always happy to help.Additionally, if proper regard is paid to the teachers they will be willing to teach and can provide  quality knowledge for that topic and share their experience too.\n\nTo sum it up, if pupils are facing  any issues they can tell their professors there and then and rather than passing comments they should ask respectfully to understand the topic.",

    "essay": "Recently, thanks to the influence of  globalization, the phenomenon of students are allowed to express their opinions on teachers' performance has aroused concerns among various circles. Although there are compelling arguments in favor of making a criticism would impact the conduct of students, I concur with the view that making criticism on a teacher's performance can bring more positive effects.\n\nOf all the reasons why criticism could bring negative impacts, probably the most significant one is that not only should educational schools teach students on academic subjects, but also teach them to be all-rounded individuals. According to Confucianism, it is of paramount importance that pupils should always respect their mentors by all means. If pupils are encouraged to give feedback to their teachers regarding their performance, a sense of apprenticeship would be disrupted as students would treat themselves equally important as teachers, in terms of the teaching role in a school educational system. Worse still, students would not listen to their teachers anymore, that in turn would lead to misconduct behaviour or even violence, due to the loss of discipline.\n\nDespite the aforementioned negative effects of making comments to the teachers, I am personally of the opinion that it could facilitate the learning progress of students. Regarding the roles of a teacher, they are responsible to understand the needs of every student and, hence, develop individualized learning materials for students to make their own answers in their assignments. By giving feedback on the teaching performance of teachers from students, as a result, teachers can able to modify their teaching styles or plans in a bid to improve the student learning process. For example, most of the students are required to fill out the evaluation form regarding the teaching material, in different high schools, in order to improve the educational quality of the classroom to better examination results. And therefore, by having appropriate feedback from students, the teaching quality can be effectively improved.\n\nTo summarise, although making criticism on teachers' performance may lead to student misconduct behaviour, it is of uttermost significance that this could enhance the teaching quality of a school in an efficient way. It is hoped that this topic could be made worldwide in order to increase  public awareness.",

    "essay": "It is believed by some that learners should be taught to raise their concerns and criticize while learning in order to upgrade the educational system. However,others find it an undesirable and negative move, as it may cause disrespect of teachers and indiscipline in the classroom. Even though  asking doubts without hesitation can somewhere prove troublesome, I completely loud its overall advantages and favour it.\n\nOn the one hand, the freedom of clearing the questions of scholars sometimes creates undue disturbance and distraction in the study room. This is because, lobbies of non-serious students are more likely to put unimportant queries for the sake of creating humour, as they are aware that their educators are bound to respond. Above all, chances are greater that they can put wrong allegations on their educators for not satisfying their doubts if they have had any record of punishment. One such case surfaced in Calcutta when,according to FIR,our teacher committed suicide as he was harassed and disrespected by his learners for not being capable of using a smart class screen.\n\nOn the other hand, I feel that questioning is the basic right of education. Undoubtedly, when anyone learns something, he is more likely to be sceptical about certain facts which can only be eradicated by asking more and more.Thus, suffice to say, being vocal during class time bills confidence which further leads to success. Secondly, interrogation helps strengthen the bond between educatees and tutors. Since students' involvement motivates the lecturer to go beyond their limitations, it proves that the speaker is being heard and understood. So, in a way, in order to build a healthy relationship, learners ought to be liberal in putting questions while studying time. \n\nIn conclusion, despite having some chances of arguments and negativity in the classroom, scholars should be free to reveal their problems in front of their tutors due to fact that it gives them the opportunity to learn profoundly and boosts their self-esteem.",

Nowadays, it is important that it is the most effective tool to develop educational quality for students and teachers. However, I am of the opinion that this is a matter to be debated in the light of some factors before any conclusion can be drawn.\n\n  First of all, due to the popularity of the private education sector and online education resources,  these days, students can compete with some of their teachers. And meanwhile, they are as versatile as expected, for example with the rapid development of science and technology, students as a new invention in the 21 st century is becoming very populous in social life.\n\n   Secondly, critical suggestions by students may motivate teachers to improve their teaching methods. Furthermore, these critical suggestions encourage teachers that, this influence positive effects in the educational lessons, for ,  instance  the reason why  the teacher can enlarge their knowledge of scope.\n\n   However, the disadvantages of students' criticisms are undeniable. Firstly,  a student at high school is not natural enough to criticize educators since their negative feedback are based on emotion and feelings rather than facts and logical  conclusions. Above all teachers can be scared of the criticizing and start to ever mark and look up at students. Moreover, students will become good-for-nothing people without teachers. To sum up, I find the students offer  positive results to influence for teacher`s skills and educational quality. I am in favour of pupils' offers to their teachers.",

In this ,essayÐ± I will try to go into both sides and provide my own opinion as well.\n\nOn the one hand, those in favour of the expansion of pupilsâ power in the classroom have valid reasons to be concerned about the skillsets teachers possess and the educational growth of this generation.  It is an undeniable fact that every human being has their own unique character and as a result of ,that each student requires different ways of teaching approaches. Therefore, the government should introduce special policies upon schools to give certain opportunities for students to give feedback and let their teachers know the side they are lacking on teaching and we can witness enormous progress in the school system.  Further and more importantly, if society stuck behind the old methods of schooling over decades and decades of time we might never discover the gifted students  who can have a massive influence on society later on. \n\nOn the other hand, there are many people who would argue that handing power to immature boys and girls over someoneâs career is not the right modification in the educational system and incur possible problems on the way too. For instance, some teenagers might grade the teacher incorrectly not just he or she is bad at their job but punishment that was given to them. This will jeopardize oneâs career and affect the self-esteem of a teacher. It can be spotted that a feeling of losing a spot can push school teachers to overestimate the student when it comes to marking. Moreover, this policy leads to cross the line between student and teacher and respect for tutors will decline dramatically especially among high school pupils.\n\nIn conclusion, I would stress that I support the idea of small changes in the teaching system like those but I think giving suggestions is  definitely a better option rather than criticizing in this way.",

    "essay": "There has been a heated controversy on whether high school students should be free to evaluate and criticise their educators. While some people think that disrespect and indiscipline are the unavoidable aftermath of this approach, I would contend it would result in increased educational quality.\n\nOn the one hand, there is a common belief that enabling students to judge teachers may undermine studentsâ sense of respect and discipline. High school students are generally immature, inexperienced and impulsive; they tend to lose their temper and overreact each time they are disciplined by the teachers. The problem is even worse when all the students see their peers criticising the teachers. They may think of such action as a right way to behave and start to imitate it. As a result, the classroom learning environment can be filled with disrespect and indiscipline.\n\nOn the other hand, I side with those who believe that giving students the total freedom in expressing their thoughts and feelings towards teachers may enhance educational standards. Many countries are promoting students-centred teaching with two-way communication, where open discussions between teachers and students are encouraged. This approach has a clear advantage of making students become proactive in studying. It also provides teachers with a chance to better their pedagogical skills by receiving feedbacks from students. By this way, both the learners and the educators can achieve higher academically.\n\nIn conclusion, the educational of encouraging high school students to judge their teachers may undoubtedly lead to enhanced academic achievements, despite the possibility that a disrespectful and undisciplined attitude amongst the class.",

    "essay": "It is argued that the primary advantage of multinational companies is to the surroundings whilst, others disagree and believe that world business is their number one objective. This essay agrees with the argument that businesses are more benefited as they make a huge profit rather than the protection of the environment.\n\nTo begin with, many people say that big companies help to protect the environment by funding various programmes and projects. In other words, these business companies donate thousands of dollar to the cause that protect the natural environment such as helping for forestation. To exemplify, Coca-Cola, a world-renown multinational company spends 15%  of its total profit (which is equal to millions) annually to plant trees in the deforested areas of the world. Hence, in this way environment is benefited by the big cooperations.\n\nHowever, I believe that, the giant cooperations mainly focus on making a profit and their own business because millions of dollars are invested in the firm. This is to say that, thousands of people put their money on these companies expecting to get profit so the first and foremost goal is making money for the investors. For example, if a multinational company does not make a profit then the investors and shareholders begin to withdraw their capital from the business, which can result in the closure of the firm. Therefore,  international businesses primarily target to earn a profit than secondly, contribute to protecting the environment.\n\nIn conclusion,  global companies can greatly help to protect the environment by funding various programmes that work to save the environment. However, international firms first work to get profit and benefitm the business world because of the pressure from the investors to raise the money back then only they can offer their help to safeguard the surroundings.",

People there are encountered with an extreme scarcity of food, and the widespread malnutrition and death from starving. Most of the reasons comes from inevitable natural weakness, for instance, prolonged flooding, drought, extreme cold, insect infestation and plant disease which canât be deal with country itself.

Those kinds of emergency are overwhelming challenges which insist on international assistance.

Although some communities believe that e-book destroys the nature of the book, others think that this technology gives a new and better meaning to the book. In this essay merits and demerits of both points of view will be discussed.\n\nNew tools and inventions in the last century, give people improved methods to store data like text. This way of storage is more intelligent because we can transport these very easily. To illustrate, the transportation of 1000 reports in the past was a really huge work to be done but now we can move them on a CD. Moreover, disasters such as war, flood, earthquake, and fire could destroy libraries and consequently millions of reports in a fraction of a second. To clarify, keeping bills on hard disks is safer. In addition, using hard disks for storing statements eliminate neccecety of cutting trees to write  books. \n\nOn the other hand, from the readers' point of view, reading bills on paper is more comfortable. for example, they claim that e-book affects human eye health. Additionally, they say electronic books do not have the same good feeling as paper books. Also, researches show that concentrating on a subject is more when you read it on paper.\n\nIn conclusion, like other technologies, keeping reports on hard disks or reading them on the screen has both negative and positive sides.

    "essay": "It is hard to deny that the internet is still a new-born technology compared to paper and books which have existed for hundreds of years. Such a fact leads impressionable people to generate the opinion that keeping knowledge on the internet has many drawbacks. However, as far as economy, environment and educational standards are concerned, I strongly hold that we benefit more from information that is put on the internet. \n\nFirst and foremost, storing knowledge on the internet could increase public educational standards as information can be spread more easily over the internet. To be more specific, you can store as much as information you want on the internet and all of it can be checked on any electronic device as long as it is accessible to the internet, there is no constraint on location or time. While the more knowledge is contained in a book, the thicker and heavier it will be. And people can only access the knowledge in that book if they buy or borrow it. Thus, it would be much more convenient to share and spread knowledge through the internet as people are more willing to store and access information on the internet.  \n\nFurthermore, the fact that keeping information on the internet does not require the use of paper indicates that it is very eco-friendly. Take the case of my friend as an example, who shifted the way of studying last year. Starting from then, he made all his notes on a laptop and read electronic books instead of real books. As a result, his personal consumption of paper has declined by over 95%. Therefore, storing knowledge on the internet enables people to reduce their usage of paper, which could save large amounts of water in paper production as well as prevent deforestation to some extent. \n\nHowever, a voice arises that storing information on the internet prevents poor people from accessing knowledge as they might find it hard to afford electronic devices. This viewpoint ignores the reality that smart phones have already become a necessity in our every life. People who is not able to buy these devices would also face difficulties in purchasing books or other forms of learning. Besides, once people have their own devices, they can attain all of knowledges in the internet, which saves large amounts of money to buy books every year. Therefore, accessing knowledge through internet could in fact be a more economical option. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe the whole society could be influenced by the online conservation of knowledge in a positive way.",

    "essay": "These days Internet plays a vital role as a means of keeping and delivering the knowledge while books did in the past. Although storing information in books is preferred by some people, I strongly believe that storing knowledge online will be more beneficial.  This essay will highlight those views and reasons behind my thoughts.\n\nOn the one hand, some people argue that storing information or knowledge on paper has its own merits. They are likely to love the smell of paper and the texture when they read. Those who prefer carrying books to searching online tend to think it has the value of owning a book. Also, those who love books love to collet them as a hobby. It reflects personal tastes and choice.\n\nNevertheless, storing knowledge on in the Internet has plenty of positives which allow people to store information permanently.\n\nUnlike paper, online information does not require any physical or chemical maintenance work to preserve it for a long time. It even does not disappear for good. For example, back in the past, we have been through a tremendous loss of valuable and historical books due to the terrible accidents such as war, fire, or natural disaster. In this regard, people are aware of the significance of storing information safely and permanently. \n\nMoreover, online information or knowledge is accessible by everyone and everywhere. All we need to do is just searching the Internet to look for the information that we want rather than going to book shop or libraries. It allows us to save physical time and effort to travel and get it.  Even though I need a particular knowledge, it is available anytime and anywhere if there is connection with Internet. This easy accessibility to knowledge can enable us to improve the quality of life.\n\nIn conclusion, those beauties of storing knowledge or information on the Internet makes it possible to live more convenient and effective world.",

    "essay": "It is true that in modern times, citizens tend to have  a healthy lifestyle. This trend endows a significant number of benefits for each individual and the government. The following paragraphs will shed light on my perspective.\n\nThere are many positive impacts of pursuing a healthy life. First, it allows citizens to get rid of lethal diseases. These days, in developed countries, individuals have hectic schedules which prevent them from nutritious meals. Thus, they opt for junk food which causes several healthy problems such as cardiopathy and diabetes. For these reasons, they are changing their eating habits to vegetables. In addition, according to experts, residents who  exercise regularly will have long expectancy compared to people who lead a sedentary lifestyle. Second, it is also a positive sign for the development of countries. To elaborate, a healthy labour force will enhance the producing efficiency which plays an important role in improving the economic situation.\n\nEncouraging citizens to eat healthier and join in outdoor activities is extremely essential. The most pertinent point is that the government should raise the awareness of individuals. For instance, American authorities established a variety of sports competitions which enhance the insight of healthy for residents. This campaign helps the rate of obesity patients fall down from 10% to 6% in 2023. Besides, the citizen should create a plan to exercise for themselves. It will stimulate them to get  excellent well-being in the long term.\n\nIn conclusion,  developed societies allow individuals to take care of their well-being. They have to balance life between eating habits and sports activities frequently. Therefore, it brings a significant number of benefits for individuals and society.",

    "essay": "People now prefer to make a decision to eat nourishments which is good for their health and exercise on a regular basis. Society experiences this trend is due to a couple of reasons and there are a wealth of ways to make them eat healthily and exercise.\n\nOn the one hand, the foremost reason is that citizens are aware of several diseases that they could suffer from. People pay more attention to what they eat every day which affects directly their digestive systems. If consuming a large amount of junk food and not practising, inhabitants of all ages can easily get diabetes, problems relating to the immune system or are over-weight. Second, ,adolescents these days are inclined to take good care of their own bodies more than in the past. Teenagers usually go on a diet with a careful selection together with exercising to burn calories and keep fit so that they do not have to worry about body shaming, especially the girls in Korea.\n\nOn the other hand, the methods to increase the number of citizens digesting good products and doing more activities are varied. Each household can improve the meals with healthy products following family membersâ tastes. This seems to be a matter of individual tastes to modify personal eating habits. In addition, local authorities should launch some campaigns such as running, walking 1 to 5 kilometres and reward to inspire both adults and children to manoeuvre more. For instance, offering discounted tickets can encourage them to attend more and not be lazy to exercise.\n\nIn conclusion, there are more and more residents who refuse to absorb fast food and get used to exercising. This becomes the trend all over the world owing to the changes in their consciousness and consideration for their bodies. Besides, inhabitants are able to be encouraged to digest healthier nutrients and do more activities by adjusting their everyday meals and taking part in local campaigns.",

Personally, from my point of view, it is a great course and modern citizens have got many advertisings, as well as mass media. Additionally, in terms of involving new individuals, this strategy has to be prolonged, plus it would be very efficient to include special sport and educational programmes into a free package which will be accessible for all citizens. Moreover, provide an affordable cost of healthy food in order to ensure that they are on the same price level with fast food and other insalubrious products.\n\nAccording to this course, we can notice that plenty of individuals want to be fancy, sporty and keep up with the times. For instance, in Russia, especially in Moscow there is one very famous and special grocery network which provide high-quality products, it also contains very nice design and many bonus programmes. Consequently, the majority of neighbours prefer to buy everything there and in connection with this have become involved in this image of life. Furthermore, the Internet and especially social networks are full of photos whit sporty and young strangers, which can motivate other people to follow their image.  \n\nOverall, modern society has got many motivating features and mostly they are successfully working.

I am inclined to agree with both of the ideas for a number of convincing reasons.\n\nThe first idea set out can be true for two solid reasons I am about to explain. Since the beginning of humanity elderly people are always respected and almost every idea, they put forward were always supported without any doubt. The second reason, based on a stereotype, is that older members of public are seen as more experienced and omniscient individuals, hence directors of associations, enterprises often found to be older people.\n\nRegarding the second idea that is claimed, I utterly agree that well-educated younger people would make a better leader as they are full of energy, open to endeavor new management techniques for the best of their workplace. For instance, young ambitious worker would go through sleepless nights to create a project that can benefit to the company and their career and that can be realised thanks to their robust health. In my view, this derives from the urge to prove themselves in society as a prosperous young leader.\n\nTo sum up, I am in agreement with the opinion that chiefs of people in organizations are generally older people due to their work experience and reputation they collected over the years.

    "essay": "Nowadays, the revolutionary development in technologies has allowed researchers to further enhance medical services. However, some people hold a belief that scientists should turn their focus to more urgent problems. From my perspective, both notions come with some noticeable merits, which will be discussed in the following essay.\n\nTo shed light on the benefits of concentrating on other issues across the globe, an improvement to the world ecosystem should be mentioned. For instance, as global warming is currently a devastating obstacle for the destructive effect that it caused on the surrounding environment, the fauna and flora will be ensured better living conditions if governments choose to invest in solving it. This decision will not only recover the biological circle but also maintain the diversity of wildlife, which contains many unfolded mysteries for a potential breakthrough in future scientific research. Thus, making the previously mentioned statement a worthwhile initiative to consider.\n\nOn the other hand, pouring time and money into resolving global health problems plays a threshold role in allowing safety for another research to be proceeded. To be more specific, a number of innovative experiments contain dangerous substances that pose a threat to scientistâs survivability. Additionally, society will also benefit from these developments since remedies for incurable diseases will definitely be in top priority. Take cancers as a prime example, our orbit has been suffering from this illness for centuries, making an effective antidote the ultimate outcome that the current era needs. Because of this aforementioned importance, I personally believe the merits that further analysis of health issues will eclipse that of other important troubles. \n\nTo reiterate, although both ideas provide concrete evidence about why they should have more privilege, the benefits that solving health problems will utterly outweigh the opposite opinion in terms of significance toward the general public.",

While some people argue that research on science should be conducted mainly on global health issues, others believe that other problems are also significant. Both perspectives would be explained in this essay. \n\nOn the one hand, global health problems have become more rampant throughout the years, especially with the unpredictable rapid appearance of viruses among nations like COVID-19. Thus, commencing scientific studies might redeem the number of patients. For instance, in 2020, the government was able to tackle the spread of COVID-19 and prevent the spike of sufferers due to a dazzling commitment to support research involving the invention of coronavirus vaccines. As a result, tourist attractions, offices, and industries are allowed to be run without tight restrictions and the world begins to revitalize. Therefore, it is of importance to dedicate scientific research on international health to counteract and resolve upcoming worldwide diseases. \n\nOn the contrary, other subjects could not be overlooked. Studies on agriculture contribute to public well-being as its studies assist farmers to develop well-bred crops which could make it easier for developing countries to harvest high nutrition yields with limited farming equipment. For instance, in Kenya, scientists developed ways to grow plants in infertile soil during a dry season. Because of this, the lack of food in developing nations is scarce and inventions in agriculture solve the worldâs hunger.\n\n \n\nIn my opinion, although both arguments are valid, global health should be prioritized and thus, scientific investigations should become the focus. However, studies on other fields might be conducted as long as their proportion is worth less than research on worldwide health problems.\n\n \n\nIn conclusion, manifesting an observation on other fields might be beneficial to solve the world hunger yet public health ought to be the major attention to tackle some of the deadly viruses like coronavirus, variola, or Ebola.",

As a result , to face these health-related problems,governments spend millions of money on studies.

Since  some communities around the world are already feeling a shortage  of energy sources , these kinds of studies are also important to overcome the future demand . For example , according to the World Bank report in 2019, by 2040 fossil fuel will be an end and to overcome the shortage of energy requirements,people need to think about new energy sources.\n\nIn conclusion , even though some people believe in spending money on non-medical researchers to overcome problems like energy sources in the future , prioritising medical studies will prevent the extinction of mankind from the planet earth .

While others and I disagree with the idea and think that there are more crucial threats. In the following paragraph, both of these viewpoints will be discussed in detail before the conclusion is reached.\n\nOn the one hand, one of the major reasons that folk say that research nowadays should focus on handling world health problems is that they would like to have a longer life. In other words, these days, the average length of human life is seventy years old. As a result, if medicines and medical treatments are enhanced, people will have an extended lifetime.

To illustrate, the Covid-19 is a hazardous disease that people around the world have not known before and have to invent vaccines to deal with it.\n\nOn the other hand, the obvious reason that individuals think that there are more vital issues is that environmental problems are tremendously significant. In simple terms, If the environment is poor, it will affect our lives severely. For instance, the fumes emitted from cars can cause lung diseases. On top of that, political issues also play an important role in our lives.

In my point of view, I believe that every domain, which I will delve into herein as well as explain my opinion, should be resolved equally.\n\nOn the one hand, health complaints are one of the most dangerous things that experts need to resolve. Recently, it has been the boom of the covid-19 epidemic since 2020, which directly impacts our lives. In detail, this contagious virus can be infected through respiration, thus the number of people contracting this affliction has been increasing day by day. Therefore to end this pandemic before it is out of control, not only an individual nation but also the whole world have to accompany. Pfizer from the USA is the pioneer in experimenting and manufacturing a specialized covid-19 vaccine to alleviate. \n\nHowever, there are some domains besides the epidemic that need researchers and government to pay attention to it. Firstly, due to the pandemic that I mentioned above, the unemployment rate has increased. In-depth, many companies, hotels and restaurants have to suspend, therefore, they have to cut down on employees to diminish their losses. Secondly, Russia has been making a proclamation of war with Ukraine, which affects some fields such as gold and oil costs.

    "essay": "It is true that there is a declining number of young people who opt to work in the field of agriculture. There are a number of reasons for this, and I believe that the idea of whether to encourage more of the young to do farming work should depend on the goals of each country.\n\nTwo main factors are to blame for the shift away from farming among the young generation in many parts of the world. Chief of these is the adoption of machinery in farming activities. In fact, most labor intensive tasks in farming are now done by machines such as trucks, forklifts, automatic sprinklers, and even airplanes. This means that fewer workers are needed to run a farm. Added to this is the fact that the income of farmers is notoriously unstable due to the unpredictability of weather conditions. As a result, more young people are moving to cities to look for jobs with more stable streams of income rather than doing farm work.\n\nThere are countries that should incentivize young people to do farming work more, while others should not. Regarding the former, if these countries wish to become independent regarding their food supplies or if agriculture is the key sector driving their economies, they should encourage more of their young to get involved in farming. However, as for countries that wish to develop other sectors such as science, technology or tourism, there is little point in having more young people involved in agricultural activities. Instead, they should be encouraged to develop their skills and gain knowledge related to the target driving forces of the country. \n\nIn conclusion, the main causes of the waning popularity of farming work among the young are primarily the adoption of machinery in farming and the unstable nature of such jobs. I feel that it depends on each country to decide whether to motivate more of their young citizens to work in this field.",

Although parents are majorly responsible for their offspringâs actions, I entirely harbour the perspective that lawbreakers would be accountable for their offences and ought to be punished.\n\nTo commence with, parents should be punished if their child does any crime as there are a huge number of cases are stemming from lack of parentâs attention and love towards their children. Nowadays, parents are working day and night in order to earn a luxurious livelihood for their wards, but it affects terribly on their children as it will have detrimental impacts on their cognitive development, and they would be more likely to indulge in anti-social activities. \n\nHowever, I still hold the firm belief that children who commit crime should also receive deserving punishments. Firstly, when the young offenders are punished with having custody and serve community service, they would deeply understand the seriousness of their wrongdoing and feel regretful. To be precise more, by conducting punishments, young people can be well-educated about the cost of crime committing and will never repeat the same mistake in future. For instance, if parents will take all the blame on themselves, it will have misled impacts on their offsprings, which force them to understand that if they commit any wrong actions, it will not bother them. Hence, deserving punishments should be given to them to alleviate the causes of juvenile delinquency in the long run.\n\nIn conclusion, even though parents are responsible for their childrenâs offences, the lawbreakers ought to be solely answerable for their crimes.

    "essay": "It is debated by some people that parents of children who breach the case, should be penalized in the same ways. I disagree, as no parent would ever encourage his or her infant to become a criminal, and punishing the parents for the fault of one juvenile would be unfair to the other siblings.\n\nParents, no matter how many offences they have committed themselves, would never persuade their youth to break the mandate. That is to say, parents have an innate desire, to raise their kids to become a successful, case-abiding citizen. However, kids these days hardly ever listen to their parents, and yearn for independence, at a very early age, from their parents and ruling. For instance, a recent survey in the UK showed, almost 80% of the children who were caught shoplifting, were already being seriously condemned and punished by their parents. \n\nAnother reason I am against punishing the parents for the crimes of their child is that this would be unfair to the other innocent siblings. They have done nothing wrong, and thus, donât deserve to have their parents taken away from them. Putting their parents in jail would also increase their chances of following the bad path and the whole family would be destroyed. Children raised in social care centres and foster homes are known to have 10 times more personality disorders and violent temperaments.\n\nIn conclusion, parents should not be convicted for their children breaking the law, as they try their best to deter them from doing so.

I would say road immunity is not just fenced in by limited options but some real determinative factors can be effective on it. I will declare my opinion in the following of this essay.\n\nThese days, you can hear through the press and media that thousands of people are being died on road trips. And it arouses a sense of downbeat and letdown among officials. They are seeking a way to drop this statistic. On the one hand, events that happen on the roads can be influenced by a huge variety of issues. For example, how to construct roads, and whether they follow existing standards or not. Also, another option can be the cars on the roads, whether they are modern and up-to-date with maximum security or are run-down. An outdated car besides that can be harmful to the air and environment due to pollution like exhaust fumes, and also can be the reason for road disasters and irrecoverable losses. \n\nOn the other hand, the cause of a part of these events is human and might be to blame. It is partly brought about by disregarding grave immunity issues. Such as speaking on the telephone, being tired and sleepy, and at high speed. Sure, under these conditions, one vigorous way to decrease the events and crimes is fine and stricter punishments. \n\nIn conclusion, I reaffirm road safety is not just surrounded by human causes.

Firstly, the laws that are more serious might impact society. That means if enforcing these kinds of rules such as raising the amount of money is fined or confiscating the driving license, it is more easy-going for the governments to control residents to be law-abiding on the road. Secondly, another reason why administrators should promulgate is because the pain that people have to suffer from a prison sentence or even sophicastors might be related to mortality. Therefore, it goes without saying that giving much stricter punishments can be applied for numerous benefits for society.\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, I fervently believe that there still exist measures that can effectively enhance road safety. Apparently, it is suitable for the government to install cameras to catch driving offences such as exceeding speed or traffic accidents. As a result, it is more analysable for citizens to lead the public regulation. Moreover, the detailed guidelines could be published for society to follow, including how to know inside out the systems of traffic rules and understand the morals when joining the road. It can be said that easy-going laws make people more rexalxable to lead an exemplary citizenâs life.\n\n \n\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that it is undeniable that stricter punishments could be ways to keep people in the model for society with safety; however, there are a variety of methods that tend to lead to safe traffic and without driving offences such as installing cameras or setting a guideline.",

This essay will elaborate more on the preamble that is ,government should enforce strict punishment for those who offend the rules and regulations on our roads.\n\nTo begin with,most people are afraid of being given the ticket when they park on the wrong side of the road.By giving out tickets to bad drivers,it in turn corrects drivers who drive haphazardly on our years and hence improving safety.This style of punishment for instance is mostly common in the Western worlds.\n\nIn addition,another punishment that can be given to recalcitrant drivers to improve free movement of driver and pedestrians are to fine them an amount of money when they are found to bend the rules.Also they can be sent to police custody if they break a major on the rule on our roads.For Example,a driver who drives on the path meant for walking should be picked up by the police to deter other road users from repeaing the same act.\n\nFinally ,I agree with the statement that much difficult punishment like, giving out fines,arrest by the police are some of the ways that can improve safety on our roads.",

    "essay": "Road safety is a very important and concerning matter. Carelessness while driving can lead to severe accidents. Therefore, the only way to improve the safety of our roads is to give much stricter punishments for driving offences. According to my perspective, I completely agree with administering severe penance for any kind of recklessness or irresponsibility on the streets as any mistake can cause someone to lose his or her life. In the essay, I will discuss the reason that lead to accidents and why severe penalizing is necessary for such delinquency.\n\n Firstly, punctuality is a major reason for mishaps on the highways. To put it more simply, people speed on the highways and break traffic rules when they are getting late to reach their destination. To illustrate, suppose a man needs to reach work by 8 but he started off late from home. So now to get to the office quickly he will break the speed limit which is very dangerous and can create disasters any moment he loses control. He might injure himself badly or even worse die.\n\n Secondly, drunk driving also originates tragedies on highways. Often youngsters drink and drive which results in them losing control and crashing into something else. It is very concerning as it can severely injure someone or even worse take someone's life. Likewise, teenagers speed on the tracks as being part of a racing competition or just for fun or adventure which is unacceptable because all of this promotes mishaps.\n\n To conclude, folks have a very casual attitude towards traffic laws. They are more prone to breaking them despite the fact that it can save their lives. Hence as mentioned earlier in the essay, I hold the view that the only way for the betterment of road safety is to administer severe penance on speeding offences on the streets as nothing is more important than life.",

Drunk driving is a serious issue in every country. There is an increased reports of drunk driving in the recent times. Government must impose a stricter punishment for this offence as it is a man made issue and can be tackled if acted accordingly. Punishments like cancellation of driver's license, or a penalty can control this traffic offence to an extend. Also, authorities must keep a constant check on such drivers  and an  alert system should be implemented.\n\nIn addition, to this there are many other causes of road accidents, namely: violation of  traffic rules, failure to stop at pedestrian crossings, over-speeding, jaywalking  and many more. Competition between young drivers have become a serious issue these days. Traffic department must start an awareness program to all citizens about traffic rules and consequences faced for violating them. The awareness program must be good enough to  attract all  age groups as it is a better  to instill positive attitude in young minds as it will be perceived well.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that imposing strict punishments for driving offences can ensure safety on roads relatively.

    "essay": "Many people believe that imposing harsher punishments on driving offenses is  the most useful measure to enhance road safety. I largely disagree with this  view.  It is quite understandable why people claim that more severely punishable  actions should be taken by government to have better road safety. The two  most notable causes of fatal accidents in the road are that a large amount of  drivers are likely to be indeed addicted and exposed a lot to alcohol and in turn be drunk when they commuting, and driving above the speed limit, which is one  of the most popular crimes commited by people . Therefore, giving much  stricter punishments such as fining them much higher money or even custodial  sentence can render them more careful and entail a falling mortality rate.  However, I believe that education is by far the most effective measures so as to  improve road safety. To the best of my knowledge, the odds of commiting  driving offences sometimes hinges on the attitude of drivers. The government  and school should organise a lager number of driving lesson to educate them  about the negative consequences of accidents on victims and themselves.  Comparing to punishments, the increasing awareness is more practical and time  and money saving. To illustrate, if students are taught about attention when  driving in the early days, the latter will become the inherent instinct of their life  and prevent them from a lot of misdeeds.  In conclusion, my convinction is that punishments are important but education  is the better solution to tackle road safety problems.",

Personally, I believe that the highways should be controlled by the government in order to prevent any automobile accidents. \n\nOn the other hand, it is true that in order to maintain the road safety, the authorities can install the CCTV cameras across the motorways. This can reduce the traffic accidents and crime rate. Moreover, introducing the laws which are purposed to decrease the car crashes deaths and rates. For example, some people believe that there is should be much stricter punishment for the individuals who drive the vehicle when they drunk the alcohol drinks. In addition, the driving licence should be given to adults, not to the teenagers.\n\nOn the other hand, some individuals reckon to think that such kinds of methods will not work until the government provide the facilities which can maintain the road safety. It is clear that the accident number is directly influenced by the condition of motorways and highways. Furthermore, the authorities should not allow the youngsters to drive a car. For instance, many countries have not such kind of restriction. Accordingly, the pathway deaths are high in such regions. In addition, if the drivers are not bothered by the mobile phones, they can concentrate on their way. The restriction of smart phones can be another solution of this problem.\n\nIn conclusion, although many people are keen to think that the main cause of the casualty is the lack of control, others feel that in order to prevent any misadventures on the motorway, the government should maintain the teaching method of young drivers.

To a certain point, I would agree with the statement, but there are other methods that could also be used to improve it as imposing a stricter penalty, in my opinion, is not the only way to ensure safety on roads.\n\nOn the one hand, it is true that having a stricter punishment and increasing the penalties for irresponsible drivers would reduce traffic accidents and improve road safety. For example, it is a fact that using a mobile phone while driving a car is a dangerous act. However, due to the light punishment, many people still use the phone while driving. Should the authority change the punishment into a heavier one, then people will consider twice before they use the phone while driving. Besides, violation of any traffic rule can lead to a severe accident and if the punishment is made a stern, people would likely obey them.\n\nOn the other hand, there is another method that the government could use in improving road safety besides having a stricter punishment. The government could make a campaign about safety driving through various media which would show the effect of careless driving. For instance, the government could make a safety video about road safety and upload it in social media since the message will be effectively spread in this kind of media. As more people are watching these videos, it is hoped that drivers will have a clearer view of safety driving.\n\nIn conclusion, to a certain extent, I agree that having a stricter punishment would improve road safety.

In my opinion, the rise in the demand of male-dominated job positions by females are blessing for the society. I am going to discuss the essay in the forthcoming paragraphs.\n\nThe first and foremost reason, women are career oriented because of the education opportunity they are getting today. In past, females were not aware about the profession in which they were perfect, females were considered to remain inside the four walls. However, at present education is giving chance to explore different working field. They were surrounded by male chauvinism which never let them to rise and work equally with men. However, these days ladies are now getting permission from their families to go out to proceed the work and supporting the family finances. To prove this fact, females are growing in various fields of jobs such as bus driver, carpentry, bakery , painting and many more that were mainly ruled by men.\n\nSecondly, the rise in the women empowerment is because of the egalitarian society. Different social campaign done by government authorities or public to raise the awareness among the people to equalize each sex and demolish the gender inequality. Additionally, government policies promoting gender equality and welcoming the females in different workplaces without any discrimination. To illustrate this, now in armed work forces, females are participated in the armed forces to serve the country.\n\nTo conclude this, these changes are incredibly positive, and, in my perspective, this has happened because society is now blooming with gender equality, whether it is in the field of education or work opportunities given to each individuals without any differentiation.",

From my perspective, I think that artificially intelligent machines will only substitute for repetitive tasks without skills, but some professions are still dominated by human beings. this paragraph is going to discuss this view.\n\nTo start with, robots may perform jobs which are less complex and do not require specific skills.\n\nNowadays, many companies have started to use AI or robots in manufacturing lines, because of its far advantages. In the long term, using robots can reduce large amounts of money for training freshers and the monthly salaries, and about the qualities, at this point, it is even faster and more efficient. cite to an instance, in Australia, people have tested robots working at convenience shops, replacing checkers and cashiers, Instead of losing time to train them like others, these artificially intelligent machines are able to take tasks instantly, and by collecting data these bots have experiences even higher than old staffs. in addition,  AI can work throughout the day or on holidays that no longer need compensation. So, robots with intelligence are really ideal for these jobs, when the growth of tech, we will see them more and more.\n\nConversely, occupations that run by personal contact, empathy, and critical reasoning can be only performed by humans. due to the core of these tasks needing a deep understanding and linking between one-to-one, robots are impossible to make this out, so nurses, doctors, or psychologists will continue to be human ones. likewise, people will have to be needed to make robots and develop AI, because robots that produce robots look slim, so they have to program for their AI products.\n\nTo conclude, it is likely that AI machines will be forced to take responsibility for assignments without too much skill, but others like empathy, connection, or even creating new robots still need a hand from humans.",

    "essay": "Since an increasing number of physical work is replaced by machines, there is a demand for those technologies to be promoted more effectively. Personally, I believe that this trend might influence people's lives both harmfully and positively.\n\nOn the one hand, we have to admit that advanced technologies have considerable drawbacks  to some degree.The primary reason is that highly technological machines are more likely to take some people's jobs away from them, such as cleaners, fossil miners and so on. This is because these sorts of jobs are usually physically demanding and machines won't become tired of them. Secondly, factories equipped with a large amount of machinery probably increase the prices of their products since  they have to invest significant financial budgets in these equipment. For example, items, like food, clothes and transportation, produced by technologies tend to be labelled at a higher price in the market. Therefore, machines probably affect humans' lives on employment and product profits.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe that the high technologies are beneficial to both humans and societies. Firstly, the increasing demand for more advanced machines contributes to the rapid development of technologies, which means it can boost the promotion of the whole society. For example, highly- intelligent engines are required to satisfy the basic needs of manufacturing factories. Secondly, they are conducive to making relevant jobs easier and safer, which means those workers don't have to work really hard.  For example, workers in warehouses of giant companies are able to let machinery help them lift heavy stuff. Thirdly, applying technological equipment in their industries enables them to manufacture a great deal of items in a limited time, which brings them higher profits and saves their human resources. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe high-technology machines can affect people's lives both negatively and positively.",

They are not able to get a significant amount of their life experience and develop a wide outlook during a school period. It is happened because the majority subjects in student plan based mostly on theory. It leads to difficulties because candidates are not able to form an advanced experience about their future job.

    "essay": "It is believed to think that university graduate students are going to work on the speciality they have studied. Although, there are a lot of people who can't find a profession even with a degree or a diploma. The reason for that might be an obsolete study system that should be modernised.\n\nThe universities are good at giving deep academic knowledge, but mostly they don't pay attention to skills that are needed in real jobs. Mostly, there is a lot of theory information, but no practice in their program. Workplaces hire people not only for knowledge but, also for the ability to do the task and for leadership characteristics. Those are things most research centres don't consider. As an example, I can say about my sister's work experience. She graduated from NU University as a chemistry teacher studying for 4 years. This whole time she received \"psychology\" and \"chemical science\" programs, but never taught anyone. Once there was a time to apply for a place, but she didn't fit into any centre, because of failing  an interview. They didn't want an employee who has no experience.\n\nThe solution for that is the renovation of the system.

In my opinion, those are the most significant changes that have to be done\n\nTo summarise the above, the problem of finding a career for graduates is the consequence of the absence of the right system and it can be reduced if there will be the correct approach for students' future job search.",

    "essay": "Talking about technology in the current situation of course would have benefits and drawbacks, moreover if it is related with the occupation scarcity due to the existence of robots or computers. Nevertheless, explanation of the advantages and the disadvantages will be explained in the essay below.\n\nDay by day technology fastly increases, this is something that people or even firms cannot avoid since nowadays they need technology such as  smartphones and computers in order to keep working on their responsibility. For example, a business company needs to have computers in which it makes their employees work more comfortably in the office. Hence, by having a comfortable situation in the workplace, the company would have a better performance in catching their profit. \n\nIn contrast, the drawback for having improved technology is that many people may lose opportunities to get jobs due to the existence of robots. Robots able to do automation activities such as scanning, analyzing, and even driving. Furthermore, because of these machines, some companies prefer to make a purchase in robots rather than pay a monthly salary to people. For example, toll road machines may be worked by robots because the job is just to scan payments and it means they are able to replace people. Consequently, there will be an increasing scarcity of jobs for job seekers. \n\nIn conclusion, even though technology has a very beneficial impact on humans, the development must be slightly considered so that scarcity does not occur which is detrimental to humans themselves. Therefore, the advantages if overbalance the disadvantages.",

    "essay": "These days with the advent of new technologies such as AI, a lot of people have lost their businesses and have been replaced by them. Someone may say that this process will continue, resulting in the loose of all the jobs. While others say that there are professions that only living humans can do. I agree with the latter opinion and process this view in this essay. \n\n Most importantly, professions dealing with feelings are difficult to be managed by AI. It is a privilege for human beings to be moved, shocked or angry and needless to say, those emotions can not be understood by artificially made things. For example, jobs such as mental counsellors can not be replaced. This is because there are no patterns or concrete solutions that can be applied to a mental problem. Problems regarding sentiments are always different and so the solutions are uncountable like stars. It is impossible for AI to deal with it using a pattern programmed previously. \n\n On the other hand, someone may say that if we give all the accumulated information about a job, AI will be able to run the work. I agree to some extent but the more jobs AI steals, the more works people will nurture. AI is special in that it can use effectively all the past information. However, it is unable to make new things because it lacks creativity. Therefore, only humans are able to make innovations and innovative jobs can not be replaced by humans. \n\n In conclusion, AI will never replace all jobs because it can not understand feelings and give birth to innovations.",

    "prompt": "Employees should not work in jobs they donât enjoy. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
    "essay": "After graduating, many people look for a job. Sometimes they want to work in their passion while others do not take passion as an important thing but the experience and how it can support their lives. Admittedly, the work may be difficult to follow in the beginning but over  time workers can feel the enjoyment because they get the pattern for their work. Therefore, I completely disagree with that statement.\n\nTo begin with, these days getting a passion work is not easy since there are plenty of people looking for the job as well. For example, fresh undergraduate students try to get work as same as their excitement but it takes some time. While waiting for their feedback application, undoubtedly, they need funds as well to buy their pieces of stuff. Moreover, if they ignored their tasks when they were already in the work environment, it would jeopardise them since they would not get any promotion or trust from the company.\n\nAnother point to consider is working in different areas sometimes can expand more experiences as well as networking. At first, staff may be hard to start when they have no intention of carrying out the job. For instance, someone who has an undergraduate in design and has passion in that area surprisingly accepts a job in a different area as public relations. In her new field, she has to take more time to learn but as time goes by she finally enjoys it and scales up the experience in that field. In addition, when people accept a job, they are used to knowing  their responsibilities, so it is unacceptable if they do not want to perform just because they do not feel joy in it.\n\nIn conclusion, working with the same passion might be the dream for everyone whereas these days people have to compete with each other to get the job, as a blue-collar or white-collar. I disagree with the statement because employees have to fulfil their tasks which contribute to the companyâs goal despite of like or dislike since they already sign the contract with the company. Yet, to boost  workers motivation I think the top management has to create a regular meeting with their staff to discuss  their performance.",

However, it seems to me that it is a bad trend in society in avoiding many opportunities based on what they like. Therefore, I disagree with the statement since a new thing may provide us with some benefits in life.\n\nWorking with passion is a new mindset that young people adopt through the development of the technology era. They believe that doing what they enjoy is the best way to maximise the result. Furthermore, having the same interest as the job enables employees to get their hiding potential out in working time. For example, people who love doing business play their jobs fully, almost every day without a break. It tones that they enjoy the job and they can optimise the business income.\n\nMoreover, in terms of working, workers should immerse themselves in a new environment job since it gives them some benefits. Firstly, through the new jobs, they can assimilate a new skill from either their duties or other employees. For instance, for  a person lacking communication skills working in an advertising company, the new environment enables him/her to learn the skill directly from others. Of course, it takes time and effort to blend with the new skill. However, this makes people mature with full of new knowledge and experiences in this modern era. Another benefit is that young people can take advantage of working in unusual places to broaden their perspectives. It can be a golden opportunity to actualise and implement their critical thinking. \n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that whether or not the jobs are either good or not adored with passion, people should take this opportunity to get a job in a new environment. Since it provides them with full of chances and experiences, they can boost even find their own true talent in life.",

    "essay": "Technology has been elevating and with new innovations most of the labour work is being operated by artificial intelligence. Therefore, the machines have taken control over the jobs and tasks that required excessive physical activity. Analysing the role of machines, I believe that this is a positive development as it could provide more accuracy for production and do tasks which are not possible for humans.\n\nFirstly, to err is to human and they cannot do the job with the same accuracy as that of technology. Taking this into account, 100 workers in a factory of food making are not efficient to find the error being made which could be easily detected by the machine. Certainly, the precision rate is extremely high if tasks are being conducted by robots. Therefore, AI has more efficient as compared to manpower considering the accuracy it could achieve. \n\nSecondly, labour could do extremely difficult activities like repetition movement but somehow they lack in life heavy weights that are beyond human capacity. Although some workers have the potential to lift, not as much as lifting equipment can pick. For example, forklifts are a basic necessity of warehouses nowadays because of their power to carry bulk material around also, they could help store it to load at height. Consequently, this sort of task is not achievable by employees. \n\nIn conclusion, the development of equipment to work in warehouses has improved the quality of production and it can easily do the work which is impossible in the case of humans.

    "essay": "It is indisputable that the advent of technology, especially robots, plays an vital role in modern life. Authorities say that it is possible that artifical intelligence could take over human tasks in the coming decade. Despite this replacement seems to be a good idea, it also has its drawbacks. I am going to give my opinions below.\n\nIt is appearent that the birth of robots has great contrtibutions to financial plans of governments. In the field of manufacturing, robots could potentially reduce labour costs in the long run, as they do not require salaries, benefits, or other ongoing expenses associated with human employees. Although there are maintanance costs, they can be offset by increased productivity and reduced human workforce requirements. Addition to this, the product quality would be under control thanks to robots. They could consistently perform tasks with high precision and accuracy during manufacturing processes. Moreover, artifical intelligence entities could minimize errors, reduce variability, and enhance product consistency, resulting in higher-quality products. In the future, I believe, robots will have more significant contributions to other aspects of society. \n\nOn the other hand, the appearence of robots does have its negative influences on employees. One of the major concern is that the widespread use of robots may lead to considerable job losses for humans. They take over tasks previously performed by humans, as a result, unemployment rates may rise, causing socio-economic challenges and income inequality. Despite advancements in robotics, there are still limitations and risks to consider. Robots may encounter difficulties when facing complex, unpredictable situations which require adaptability, flexibility and decision-making. \n\nIn conclusion, it is important to notice that the impact of robots on the job market and society is a complex and multifaceted issue. People need to consider both advantages and potential drawbacks of robot replacing human jobs to ensure a sustainable and inclusive future of work.Experts believe that over the next decade, robots will be doing many of the jobs currently done by humans.

    "essay": "In some parts of the world, pupils are motivated to do part-time jobs and others do not. In my opinion, I agree to allow admission to do work due to a few reasons including an extra income for covering their expenses. However, it has detrimental effects on the concentration of the studies at the maximum level. The essay is intended to cover both arguments and will establish my view.\n\nFirstly, it is a huge cost to complete education in some areas of the world, compelling school students or undergraduates to find an extra earning. As a result, the students can release some financial stress by  earning in their spare time. For an instance, undergraduates who are studying in Europe countries can spend 20 to 30 hours covering nearly half of their educational expenses. Therefore, most of the students who deserve higher education will not give up on it due to financial burden. \n\nIn the opposite, despite  the difficulties,  education has to be the key focus of the student in any circumstance. If they have extra work while studying, they do not allocate enough time to their studies. According to  research in the USA, it is revealed that  most  international students do not achieve the expected results during the course of study due to work pressure. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that  students should encourage to be employed as a source of income while keeping a balance between work and studies.

    "essay": "It is argued that both males and females can perform similarly in any kind of assigned task. I disagree with this statement due to several reasons including the level of physical and mental ability possessed by them. The essay is intended to explain my view on this statement.\n\nFirstly, based on the nature of the job and the ability to be possessed by the person to complete the job successfully are depending on  different factors including the physical and mental ability of the certain person. As a result, the level of achievement will be significantly different from person to person despite  gender. For an instance, though the unloading of heavy goods is employed by both genders, it is scientifically proven that most male workers complete the task within a lesser time compared to females in the job. This implies that the effectiveness of the work deprived the demand of specific gender to engage . \n\nSecondly, the lady plays a significant role in the family as a mother, therefore some professionals are not allowed to be engaged  due to its danger for the life during the pregnancy period. In this context, females may have restrictions to perform all the task expecting similar outcomes compared to men in work such as work in a firebridgete or investigation of crimes. As a result, the men are completely free to engage in any of the task despite  their age and qualifications. \n\nIn conclusion, though gender is not a factor to consider for performing a task, there are some instances in which females can not engage in work expecting similar outcomes compared to men and, conversely.",

    "essay": "The physical and genetic differences between men and women equip them for different activities and skills. However, in today's, scenario it has been seen that women are proving their mettle even in traditionally male-dominated jobs. This essay shall delve into the reasons for this change.\n\nThe first and foremost reason is the opportunity today's women are getting. Nowadays, as more and more women in different countries have started working outside the home, it is clear that they are able to perform jobs that were traditionally only held by men. Secondly, today's woman is also going for higher education and because of this, even the highest positions in science, politics or law, for example, can be held successfully by women.\n\nAnother reason is that today anyone can be trained to do any type of job. There is also increasing scientific evidence that individual differences between people may be more important than gender differences. In other words, women may be physically stronger than some men, while some male individuals may be more sensitive, or more caring than some women.\n\nI believe that today societies are becoming more egalitarian. Earlier, women worked in the homes in most cultures. The girl child was even denied education in many places. Even if there were employed women, they tended to dominate the so-called caring professions such as teaching, nursing or social work. But today, men and women are walking shoulder to shoulder in every field and the line of demarcation between them has faded.\n\nTo sum up, in the modern world individual men and women can be trained to develop similar abilities. Differences in aptitude and talents are greater at the individual level than at the gender level. That is why women are taking up jobs traditionally thought to be men's jobs.",

Robots can work in a dangerous environment, avoid accidents, work in a longer span and etc. For instance, when there is radiation in the work place, robotic automation is the ideal solution because they can work automatically without getting illness and injuries. Furthermore, breaks are not necessary for them. They can work twenty- four hours a day and seven days a week without any rest. All they need is electricity to supply them.\n\nOn the other hand, they also have many flaws, such as lack of emotion, lack of creativity and etc. Therefore, they cannot work as a psychologist. This job required empathy in order to help the clients out of the predicament. Moreover, they can only work for the programmed or given instruction.

Most of the oppression against women were staged pointing to them that they were not the breadwinner of the family.

In particular to the ,jobs many manufacture companyâs created tons of opportunity for skilled people, for ,example a carpenter who can manufacture one or two furniture in a week now with the help of latest machines he can create a more and he would need people to handle them there opportunity for jobs \n\nIn conclusion, machines are made people  make  life easier to finish  work and create jobs for many as tradition the meth about machines are taken jobs from humans which is not a real case in the real world. It has made life simple and helps to achieve many goals.",

    "essay": "It is true that men and women have different characteristics and abilities and hence stigmatized that they have different occupation segregation. Though men and women have different behavior and perform differently but I believe that both sexes can perform the same job in same capacity and bring the same outcome. In this essay, I will explain my disagreement below.\n\nIn every society there is a gender differences which creates different gender roles. For example, women are considered best suited for caring jobs such as teacher and nurse. In addition, females are also given the job offers in reception and advertising roles in various beauty products considering females are more beautiful and should be given feminine roles in job market. However, these are only the gender stereotype and should be eradicated from the society. For instance, many women are also carrying out the high level decision making role in various organizations like men. Women are also in police, army and in medical field which are mostly dominant by male. \n\nFurthermore, females are also contributing their role in public space. For example, now a days more women are in politics and raising their voice for the gender equality. Moreover, women are equally representing in the political space and working with the men together. For example, the president of Nepal is a female and so with the other countries like Finland and Bangladesh.\n\nIn conclusion, though male and females have different nature and different way of performing a work, I disagree that men and women should have work separation. When females are also given the opportunity and capacity development, they can also do their job perfectly in the work domain of men. Therefore, we should not differentiate the work on the basis of sex.",

We could say that Part of a country development can be measure through their technological advances and how it directly affect soceity. \n\nAn advantage that stands out of having robots doing human's jobs is the precision level a field can achieve with its tasks on a daily basis. For instance, medical procedures done with a lasers, which would be thousands of times more precise than an expert doctor's hand. Also on an industrial level, cutting and assambling machines has been optimized by other machines and robots.

Even though someone could argue that anyway they are not unemployed and have a way to move forward with life, will they be honestly satisfied? This is a huge issue that most current graduates face every year. \n\nOne of the main causes for this situation is the outdated courses which are not adjusted according to the current market trends. Because of that, the graduates will find a massive gap between the university and industry which will affect their capability to perform well. It is common to see that currently ,many companies conduct onboarding sessions and training sessions for fresh graduates who just joined the company. So, companies have expanded the chosen degree programs for a particular role as anyway they have to train graduates for it from the beginning.\n\nAnother reason would be allowing students to get enrolled with the courses without thinking about the actual requirement of the industry. This leads to an overwhelming number of graduates will be available for few opportunities, which will force some of them to find a profession even if it does not directly go along with the speciality. Many physical science studying students finally have to choose different professions due to this reason.\n\nConducting a realistic research on current market trends in the industry is required to rectify this issue. Graduation programmes need to be adjusted and intake needs to be limited so that graduates will find more aligned professions with the courses and expectations.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, males have more prestigious jobs than females. It is always said that women should be a stay-at-home mom whereas men should bring home the bacon, but now the opinion is changed. Well, there are many reasons  which will be discussed in this essay why government should  give or not give that working places to women.\n\n  On the one hand, the high-level jobs occupied by the male decreases the balances of opportunities and also power between male and female in some companies. Due to the fact that we live in the most developed and supportive century women donât have to suffer from discrimination. So to establish the equal power of both genders women actually should work in such high-level positions. \n\n On the other hand, government should not take any actions for reserving positions for females. They can create the comfortable surrounding for them by making sure that women have the access to the education which makes them powerful and fully-prepared for their future. In addition, women donât have to suffer from sexual harassment, any discrimination and so on. Moreover, government should provide strict law where humans of both genders coexist with ease. \n\n In conclusion, by analyzing that information both women and men should be viewed as equally capable and the top positions should never be reserved based on gender. Government should ensure that they put enough effort to protect women from complex problems and they should not encourage a certain percentage of any employment places to be reserved for them .",

    "essay": "In this modern era, a majority of university pass-outs could not able to find their desired jobs. This is happening due to the proliferating competition for jobs and less technical skills. In my opinion, the local government should create more job vacancies for youngsters and more technical knowledge should be awarded them so that they may find spot-related to their skill. This essay will intend to analyse both aspects in detail with relevant examples.\n\nThe first fundamental reason why young graduates could not secure work according to their profession is the ever-increasing clash for jobs. This is primarily because candidates who apply for the jobs are far more than the number of vacancies. As a consequence, young adults failed to secure a position link with their trade and commence low-level jobs. To tackle this major issue higher authorities should create more number of vacancies for youngsters so that they may find work related to their streams. For example, in 2019, the UK government create one million vacancies through foreign investment for pass-out candidates. Therefore, this high job clash could be resolved through ministry initiatives.\n\nSecond major problem is that youngsters have a low level of technical skills. As a result, they could not fulfil the profession skills requirements of the companies and struggle to receive any job. For example, the latest press release by Google company reveals that in their interview only 10% candidate receive any selection latter. To mitigate this serious issue the legislators should commence a skill development program so that youngsters may nourish their technical skills and secure employment. Moreover, if the youngsters of a nation have excellent technical abilities then that country can secure huge progress in a short period of time.\n\nIn conclusion,It has been observed that university pass-outs could not able to find their desired jobs. This is happening due to the proliferating competition for jobs and less technical skills. In my opinion, the local ministry should create more post vacancies for youngsters and more technical knowledge should be awarded them so that they may find work-related to their skill.",

    "essay": "Due to the accelerating pace of modernization, people have been influenced by the different ways of pursuing their jobs. Therefore, research indicates that in the coming years' a large proportion of people will choose to telecommute. In my opinion, people will definitely consider the option of work from home, but despite this, there will be still a few professions which need human presence rather than a digital environment. \n\nTo begin with, there are numerous reasons why most of the occupation could be done while sitting at a home. Because modern technology has made it possible for both the employer and employees to carry on their jobs anywhere and anytime. It is seen that online social media portals provide the opportunity for people to start their offline and online business so that they can work from any corner of the world. Consequently, the trend will bring cost-effectiveness for the worker as they could save their time and money to commute to and from the work. According to the  convenience point of view, it is anticipated that the vast majority of the population will choose to work from home option. For example, the Enagic Company of U.S.A, offering the number of online employments and people are earning a handsome amount of salary while working at their own pace. Thus, online occupations are an absolute imperative.\n\nConversely, there are few jobs which could not be done during our homestay. Because these kinds of professions, demands the human-beings involvement which is otherwise impossible to pursue if there will be the absence of an individual. For instance, a doctor could not examine their patients from the home, no doubt there are virtual appointments available for the people but in the cases of serious medical conditions, the doctor's presence is necessary. Overall, it is true that jobs such as corporate, project management, software developer and many more could be easily done from one's comfort zone, though lifesaver occupation is in the demand of expert's presence.\n\nTo conclude, it is true that the influence of technology is escalating in the work sectors. Likewise, in the future, more and more work will be done from the home. I firmly agree with the notion, but all jobs will not be  part of a massive shift.",

It is thought by some that individual workforces are gradually replaced by artificial intelligent robots in the future. I personally accept that some jobs in certain industries are already taken by AI robots, but I believe that not all the jobs would be done by them. \n\nIt is true that robots replace human workforce because of their accuracy and speed. Robots could do the same job much faster without errors than human. For instance, we could easily find robots which take responsibility for running machines at factories which need repetitive efforts with a huge amount of workload. Moreover, thanks to the advent of artificial intelligent technology, people no longer to work in the dangerous situations. This would lead to not only the improvement of productivities but also reduce risks of human injuries from work.\n\nOn the other hand, certain industries which require emotional connections such as lawyers, psychologists and nannies could not be substituted by robots. Even though robots have immense knowledge through their database, they could not fully interact with human.

    "essay": "These days, due to technology and science development, the role of computers in our lives is more prominent than ever. Day by day, we see more humans vocational positions that are replaced by robots and computers. However, I believe, while this trend has brought us many benefits, due to inaccuracy and instability of computers, they can cause many negative consequences in our lives.\n\nFirst and foremost, even with the enormous advancement in computer sciences, the result can lead to poor performance and critical issues. These modern tools still are not able to perform some delicate jobs as accurate as of the humankind. In recent decades, scientists have done their best to utilize robots in jobs such as performing microsurgeries, but are not always successful. Not only robots failed in many cases, but they also caused unfixable outcomes for the users. For example, one of the most famous computer failure cases occurred in Shiraz Hospital in 2002, which ended up into casualty of a patient. This patient was prepared to undergo a simple appendicitis surgery with the aid of a highly advanced robot. However, because the virtual surgeon performed a wrong action, it cut one of the patient's main arteries and caused death. Examples like this prove that the adverse consequences of using computers for sensible jobs could be disastrous. \n\nFurthermore, computers are vulnerable to many threats which can disrupt their function. In other words, the more smart they become, the more faulty they can function. As IT scientists discover novel methods of utilizing computers in people's work, malware programmers also publish viruses and spyware which have the potentials to completely shut down the entire global computer systems. A salient example here is the \"CryptoWall\" ransomware made by an unknown team in 2014. The trojan they made, targeted financial institutes by hacking their clients' accounts, and encrypting their information into nonsense codes unreadable by these institutes. This malware caused a significant problem for both clients and corporations and have not been solved unless the large banks were forced to pay a considerable amount of cash, as a ransom to the hackers. \n\nIn conclusion, using computers in our daily lives seems inevitable. However, there are occasions that these machines cause major issues, instead of helping us. Therefore, these failures make them not to be reliable tools in every job.",

However, it is believed that  technical jobs are related to men's domain and merely one-fifth of the women engage in technological fields. There are multifarious problems are associated with women such as gender discrimination and family constraint, while every dilemma can be solved by possible measures. This essay will highlight the main problems and bestow suitable remedies in the subsequent paragraphs. \n\nTo commence with, let shed some light why it is difficult for women to indulge in technical field. First and foremost, gender discrimination is one of the most conspicuous factor that illegally exists in the workplace. In other words, inequality lies in the techie offices where women are not allowed to work independently and employer gives preferences to the men as they are more superior than women. In addition, scarcity of support and family responsibilities are the other major issue for women. It is certainly true that women have to nurture their family  along with the profession.  Therefore, it is arduous for them to maintain work-life balance as well as enhance and improve their technical skills. For instance, a survey was conducted by the University of Columbia in 2017 that revealed that approximately 45% of women have less heeded towards their technical domain due to their family duties. \n\nOn the other hand, gender-based attitude and organize training for women are the possible remedies to demonstrate their talent. Primarily, gender inequality should be eradicated in the techie workplaces and treat them equally as same as men along with appreciating their work. Secondly, deliver training programmes not only help to improve the women's qualification and skills, but also update their career status in the technological organizations. To cite an example, a recent article  published in the Guardian reveals that there has been increase in the 20% of females who opt technical occupation from the last two years.\n\nTo conclude, females can be attracted towards technical jobs if gender discrimination can be mitigated in the companies and supported by their families. It is predicted that most of the technical companies endeavour to opt equality culture in order to attract them as they are in demand rather than men in the technical sectors.",

On one side, parents encourage their children to gain confidence by working on small jobs like waiters and accountants. On the other hand, most parents stop their children, especially girl child, from taking up different opportunities at this very young age.\n\nFirstly, living life differently helps young individuals to gain confidence and practical knowledge, which will help them excel in their adulthood. Additionally, it will develop their social and communication skills in turn opening up a bright future. This would help them acquire time management skills as well. For instance, a survey conducted illustrates that most students gain confidence to attend interviews, mostly by doing jobs at their early ages.\n\nSecondly, opposing this is mainly seen by, either rich parents or those who have a girl child.

Such people are exposed to a variety of problems such as high levels of stress and criminals who might come during the night shift. A few steps can be taken to solve these issues.\nShift workers are faced by different problems regardless of their jobs. Firstly, the exhaustion that they face during their working hours is undeniable. Due to not having regular working hours, their bodies cannot adapt to a specific working pattern since they might work in the evenings or at night. As a result, they suffer from the lack of sleep and feel sluggish in the morning and cannot focus on any tasks. Secondly, people who work during the night shift are exposed to the serious problem of facing dangerous people. For instance, a cashier who works at night might face dangerous criminals, thieves, or people who consumed large amounts of alcohol or drugs.\nThere are some steps that can mitigate or even eliminate the drawbacks of working shifts. Shift workers must take care of themselves during the time they are not working. In other words, they must get at least seven hours of sleep, eat three healthy meals, and take vitamins. This can help their bodies get stronger and avoid malnutrition and fatigue. Furthermore, they should be checked by their doctors regularly since they are likely to develop anxiety and high blood pressure due to high levels of stress. Another point is that supermarkets that are open during the night must install cameras inside and outside the store to threaten criminals. \nIn conclusion, although shift workers face some problems, they can be reduced if cameras were installed in supermarkets and if employees took care of themselves and maintained their health.",

In my opinion, while robots may replace humans in most professions, some jobs will require human intervention after all.\n\nTo begin with, it is true that many simple tasks, which are of a repetitive nature, are performed by the robots. Labour cost is one of the major factors behind this developing trend. Many companies, these days, prefer to invest in artificially intelligent robots rather than in humans because these machines are economical for them. Additionally, robots can perform the job more effectively and efficiently reducing the chances of human error. In automobile industry, for example, automated processes resulted in redundancy of one thousand employees. This shows that robots are replacing humans",

    "essay": "Although, âArtificial Intelligence robotsâ has been increasingly popular in the workforce nowadays. Wherein some groups of individual are giving the statement that all human works will be replaced by the machine. While I agree that all menial work could be replaced, however, it is unlikely that jobs which require human contact will be taken over. This essay will discuss the reason behind my viewpoints.\nRobots can be replaced where, specific and complex human skills are not required. Most companies are moving to machine work because of less expensive, accuracy and faster pace of work rather than giving training to employees. For instance, in order to withdraw cash, âAutomated Teller Machinesâ have been replaced mankind. In addition, at railway station tickets are taken by passengers themselves. Consequently, humans have been replaced in some repetitive, easy task areas.\n On the contrary, some jobs are never be done by the robotic machines. To put it in a simple way, it requires âHuman Touchâ. To exemplify, some fields such as psychology, education and some social work where work depends on an individual cannot be replaced. Moreover, the work programming which will be done by the machines can be inserted by the mere humans. As a result, machines would not achieve the capacity to do the human work hundred and thousands of years.\nTo conclude, it is increasingly likely that robots will end most human employment. Unskilled labour task can be replaced; nevertheless, sophisticated jobs which require human knowledge and mind will always exist. Sooner or later very small amount of jobs will be safe in progressive robotic machines.",

    "essay": "Technology has come across too far to ease the lives of human beings. In the same way, one day will come when artificial intelligence will overtake current human resources. I believe this is going to be true that many jobs would be done by robots for the sake of efficiency, however, there are still some tasks which require human involvement.\nAddressing the stance, the coming era is a time of efficiency at a faster pace so to achieve the same, these computers have to be incorporated into the workforce. To fulfil the current demand, computers are the best substitute for human beings. Moreover, they do not even demand leave from work and eventually work for twenty-four seven. Take Vardhman Mills Private Limited for instance, who plans to introduce unmanned warehouse in their plant to improve the efficiency. Resultantly, there is no question to ask that machines would be used as workers for companies all around the world, but still, there are some jobs which can only be managed by real humans.\nTalking about the other side, there are some jobs which require human skills like critical thinking which cannot be provided by artificially intelligent robots. Specifically, marketing jobs require critical thinking which can change the fate of companies. This is why such jobs cannot be regarded as an appropriate job for artificially intelligent robots. Ultimately, it is crystal clear that the artificially intelligent robot workers are going to be a real reality of the near future, whereas some jobs such as marketing would be taken by humans only.\nCompiling my thoughts, the truth of the future is that robots will be working in companies, but I strongly feel that some job profiles like marketing managers is not a task for robots but for humans due to their critical thinking ability.",

    "essay": "With the increase in technology on a daily basis, the production has transformed drastically. Machines nowadays are employed to produce products replacing humans. This essay will explain the possible benefits and drawbacks that are linked to this situation.\n\nMachineries in industries can be beneficial in many ways, among them, faster production and cost effectiveness are the most significant ones.  To elaborate in detail, machines take very less time to complete certain tasks, when compared to a person. Knitting, for example, takes 4 days for a human to make a beautiful sweater, but on the other hand, a machine takes only 10 mins to do the same. Moreover, there is no payment required to employ a technology for doing menial jobs, which cuts the cost of salaries for any industry. Hence, it is in favour of organizations in terms of profits.\n\nAlthough there are above mentioned advantages, conversely, there are issues such as maintenance and update expenses. To be able to use automobiles, it needs the staff to be trained to operate, additionally, any technical issue or update in technology will lead to extra charges. What's more is, by using gadgets in production agencies, it causes a problematic situation of job scarcity. To prove this, a research reveals that 50% of people have lost jobs in past 10 years due to technological adaptation in the industries. Therefore, it is clear that, sometimes it leads to unplanned dangers to businesses and society as well.\n\nTo sum up, Welcoming technology in the fields is unavoidable, even if technology is taking away jobs of many people, due to convenience of producing goods at greater speed, organizations will only consider as a major advantage.",

    "essay": "When young people are choosing what subject to study at an institution, most of them hope they will find a great job upon completion of graduation, in reality, most fresh graduates fail to find work in their field and some are even forced to take up below graduate level jobs. In my point of view, the root of this problem lies with the outdated higher education system that should be modernised.\n\nTraditional university learningâs do not prepare students for the first job for a number of reasons, one of them is that many programmes are too theoretical it means that highly educated studentsâ lack of simple skills required for employment, for example, the knowledge of an IT software employer prefer candidate with hand-on experience. Another reason is that universities offer too many courses in popular field such as business and law, and do not recruit enough student to engineering and science programmes. As a result, the UK labour market has an oversupply of law graduates and a deficit of engineers.\n\nA reform of higher education could reduce many of the problems, but would require joint effort from study centre and government. If organizations work closely with employers, they could teach students practical skills that companies look for. Meanwhile, the government could develop guidelines on how many studentsâ universities should recruit in each subject in accordance with the market demand.\n\nIn conclusion, a likely reason why many graduates cannot find a job in their field is because those colleges might not have provided them with the right skill set or in-demand profession. I think that the universities and the government could improve the situation by updating the content of the programmes and limiting the number of students in each subject in line with the market demand.",

    "essay": "It is commonly believed by certain individuals that artificial intelligence robots are gradually substituting humans in jobs. While many laborious jobs may eventually be done by robots, jobs that would involve human interactions would not likely be carried out be machines. This essay will discuss why some jobs would not eventually be done by artificially intelligent robots in the future.\nRobots may likely replace labour these days, in jobs that require less human effort and delicateness. A lot of corporations would rather choose robots as they have higher efficiency and improve productivity thereby increasing turnover rate. This yields more profit in the long run. For example, a huge multinational in India, has began to employ the use of machines in their production line, as was reported in the times newspaper, it is said to have doubled their production hence an increase in share value and profit. For these reasons, these low efforts jobs would likely be replaced by robots.\nNotwithstanding, some human jibs cannot be replaced by robots, as these jobs require a certain amount of human relations which machines cannot provide. Machines, despite their sophistication, would never be able to achieve and interpret emotions and circumstances which has taken the human race many centuries to master. For example, in the health sector where empathy is important would not likely be understood by artificial intelligence. All in all, it goes without reason that these kind of jobs would not be properly served by machines.\nArtificial intelligent robots are progressively replacing humans in the workforce. Even though, menial jobs may be substituted by machines, jobs requiring the human touch could never be done with artificial intelligence. Ultimately, only few human jobs would survive this age of technological advancements.",

    "essay": "Some people opine that artificially intelligent robot will gradually replace human workers. In my opinion, this is very unlikely to happen. Simple human tasks can be performed by robots; however, complex jobs requiring cognitive touch will still need to be done by humans. This essay will discuss why only a few jobs will be replaced by robots and the others / the rest will continue to need human effort.\n\nA Simple human tasks that are repetitive and conditional in nature can easily be automated. This is because companies believe that the accuracy and productivity of high volume monotonous tasks are higher when performed by robots than humans. A survey on automation in back end banking process in India reveal that not only does the process errors drop by 95%, but also productivity increases by 80% if robotic automation is implemented. For these reasons, human effort on regular menial tasks can be replaced by robotic automation.\n\nOn the other hand, jobs requiring qualities like emotion and intuition will continue to be done by humans. This is because fields like psychology will always need a doctorâs diagnosis. For instance, in the USA, while all patients undergo computer based mental tests, the patientâs diagnosis can only be confirmed accurate by a psychiatrist post face to face counselling sessions. Hence, many complex tasks that need human judgement cannot be replaced by robots.\n\nTo conclude, it is quite possible for robots to replace a few human jobs. Artificially intelligent robots can replace simple human tasks and support them in a few complex tasks; however, they can never replace all complex tasks done by them. Ultimately, non monotonous tasks requiring a human touch can never be fully replaced.",

    "essay": "Artificially intelligent robots are predominantly replacing humans in considerable areas.  Although it is possible that robots will be imparted in major activities in the near future but there are still some tasks where humans can outperform. This essay will discuss jobs where humans cannot be replaced.\nRobots can execute those jobs only that does not require innovative skills or in other words repetitive tasks consistently. Many companies choose artificial intelligence over humans in order to reduce the cost and effort that is required for hiring and training of people. To illustrate, construction companies need a lot of labour to perform tiresome tasks like mixing of concrete, lifting of heavy objects and transportation, such tasks are easily and efficiently carried out by machines effectively. The tasks require efforts but not thought and productivity increase by uninterrupted sequence hence can replace humans.\nConversely, there are a number of jobs that can be done only by humans with no replacement. It is well said that machine can perform but feel plays a role, humans can think where machines work in specific program fed. In the medical science field, nurses play an important role in taking care of patients, consoling them in difficult times. This service can never be done by the robots as they lack sentiments and emotions. In short, the facility industry needs human-oriented jobs for the best customer satisfaction that couldnât be performed by machines.\nNevertheless, the notion remains debatable that robots will take up all human employment and cone side is dominant. Unskilled labour will eventually be taken up by robots sophisticated jobs that require human intervention will always exist.

This essay will discuss why some jobs will still have human contact.\n\nBy and by, all jobs will ultimately be replaced by robots. In the contemporary world, significant companies are turning towards automation, because it is less expensive than recruiting a human and training them. For instance, In Japan the nurses are replaced by robots this leads to savings in salaries and other trivial expenses. Moreover, the banks are also automated where all the clerical work is being done by robots. This in turn, makes the process simple and hassle free .For above mentioned reasons, a job that requires unskilled work will be replaced by robots in the near future.\n\nOn the other hand, there will still be some jobs in the future which cannot be replaced by Robots. This is because by nature it is not possible for them to replace human workforce. To illustrate, the jobs which require human touch such as: Teaching, Consultation, Charity and Acting to name but a few. Linked to above this would create impediments for Robots to achieve behavioral accuracy.\n\nTo recapitulate, In future, it is highly likely that robots will replace human workforce.

In this context, I believe, on one hand, not all but a big portion of the jobs will be done by artificially enhanced machines, on the other hand, lots of new jobs will be created simultaneously that requires human touch. This essay will discuss why all the jobs will not be taken over by robots.\n\nThe robots or computer programs will mostly replace the repetitive and structured jobs. Jobs such as data entry, listing and filing office works, order fulfilling, answering calls, creating work schedules etc. non-decision making and mundane, but very structured jobs will be replaced by machines to reduce cost and enhance productivity. For instance, Amazon UK has created several smart retail stores without any cashier by making the payment completely online and automated. Hence, artificially intelligent machines will hopefully take care of these unskilled to semi-skilled jobs that do not demand any strategic decision making or complex thought process.\n\nAlthough there are still so many jobs that demands emotional intelligence that only a human being can provide. To accomplish numerous jobs human touches, such as using gut feeling or intuition to make decisions, interpersonal skills, negotiation skills and other emotional attributes are needed that cannot be completed by robots. For example, to convince a client to close a business deal in good terms needs a physical human being, where good interpersonal skills and some specific emotional intelligence come in play which the machines would never be able to replace. Therefore, many new jobs will be created in future, which will need more human feelings and emotions to get the works done properly.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe, on one hand, many routine and too much repetitive jobs will be lost to the robots. While a lot of other jobs are there and many more will be created where a human participation and emotional intellect are a paramount to get it done.",

Several problems result from this phenomenon and some solutions should be tackled by the government and individuals to improve the situation.\n\nThe growing population in the large city has brought two main problems. To begin with, many young people have difficulty getting employed due to the competitive job market. This is because rural people tend to migrate to urban areas for better job opportunities, leading to a large number of young job seekers struggling to find employment. Another issue worth mentioning is the high cost of living has put heavy pressure on young people to secure living expenses.

While some groups are of the opinion that this is not a positive situation, others opine it offers a great number of advantages. In my opinion, ads play a crucial role in every economy.\n\nOn the one hand, some individuals believe nowadays we can see lots of wrong advertisements that show a thing really flashy but in reality the product is poor in quality. In other words, there are a lot of corporations that use tricky slogans in their advertisements, which is not based on morality. For instance, I purchased a pair of shoes online, and while the website claimed it was all made of leather, after receiving I found it was made of really cheap plastic. Moreover, nowadays there are some businesses that abuse women in their ads and they show a really super-hot girl in order to tempt customers, particularly juveniles, to buy their products, which not only causes a lot of mental disorders for teenagers but also decreases the rate of morality in society.\n\nOn the other hand, advertisement is thought by lots of people as a useful topic and they believe, it has an amazing effect on heightening the quality and lessening the prices. Because in this competitive economy, companies and corporations strive to increase the quality of their products and decrease the prices of them in order to observe lots of clients. For example, it has been a long time that two famous companies in Germany, Benz and BMW, are in competition with each other, and as a result of that customers take the advantages.

In my opinion, advertisements increasing day by day is a positive development which can lead to improved competition among the companies and to ensure a growing national economy. \n\nTo begin with, there are positive consequences of advertising increasing day by day for companies and customers. Most important development is that this can ensure more competition among the dominant companies in the market. This leads to companies to increase their product diversity and they try to enhance their customer satisfaction. In this way, customers can have a choice of a better product and better purchase. Take some customers, who have some criteria for choosing a product, for example; they can create an attention-grabbing difference in the quality of product as they are picky people. \n\nMoreover, this can provide positive development for the national economy. Advertisement can encourage the economic growth of businesses in many different sectors.This promotion firstly owns companies' improvement economically that can be through attracting more customers and then it contributes to their industries that more money is in circulation as both production and consumption increase. All of these may lead to economic welfare which can increase employment and can create new job opportunities.

So, advertisement generates a diversity of employment opportunities. It provides a career for people who prepare the content of advertisements, design logos or brand awareness for companies. Without this marketing sector, we would have higher unemployment in the world. Another advantage of advertising is that it can promote brand, spread awareness of the messages about products and then products should reach potential consumers, it would attract more customers. Also, by advertising, customers could find out about newly launched products. And as a result, people could select from the bigger choice  of products and could know more detailed information about products\nHowever, advertising also has some disadvantages. First of all, there are some technology companies which are collecting data about costumers such as your browsing history or your emails to electronic companies to guide your behaviour on the Internet for commercial purposes. Secondly, there are some brands which influence consumer psychology and trigger memories of childhood or Christmas. As a result, people feel under pressure to buy those brandsâ products. Lastly, advertisers often focus on selling a brand image rather than the quality of products by using famous and successful people. Then, customers can be manipulated by the misleading, eye-catching image of influence and they will be likely to spend more money and follow the latest trend.\nIn conclusion, advertisements have some positive effects for customers and marketing companies, but it also has some negative effects for customers such as boost sales (when customers spend more money) or celebrity endorsement (when customers are manipulated).",

For instance, people who born in a wealthy family is able to access high-class education systems and a sufficient healthcare service, creating favorable conditions to achieve significant milestones. In addition, elite class always have advantages in many disadvantageous situations. As a result, such persons always have superior opportunities to reach high status.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many other factors contribute to a personâs career such as dedication, persistence, determination and endeavor. This situation can manifest itself through the fact that, Charlie Chaplin, a famous comedian in 20th century, who born in poverty and lost his father at a very young age. In spite of extremely unfavorable conditions, he then struggled with challenges and became excessively successful in his midlife.

    "essay": "It is argued that lucky is the key to some peopleâs success. As achievement is only  attributed by hard work and determination, I completely disagree with this opinion.\n\nIf success was free, everyone would have it. In fact, there are few successful individuals because each of them is determined and industrious. The harder people work on their dream, the more confident they become. Those who lack self-esteem also lack determination and end up losing hope and giving up, as a result they are the failure. For instance, Thomas Edison, one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century, conducted thousands of failed experiments with the filament until the finest light bulb was produced. His success is made by his hard work, rather than luck. Another clear case of success through determination is Nguyen Ngoc Ky, a disabled man. He could not write by hand; however, with his determination and hard word, he is able to write by his foot and became a successful teacher.\n\nBy contrast, luck does not play a role on oneâs achievements. Luck is just a state of mind, so if people are dependent on luck they could never be successful. For instance, a student who does not study for an exam, might fail. Moreover, it is clear that a person who wins a lottery, might soon lose all of his or her money as it does not require anything to achieve. \n\nIn conclusion, for all reasons I have mentioned above, I believe that to become a successful person at the end of the day, people must  be hardworking and determined to work on their dream , rather than rely on luck",

    "essay": "In the contemporary era, numerous countries witness a proliferation of uniformity in their shops and products. Supporters perceive this trend as advantageous, while critics regard it as detrimental. This essay will delve into both perspectives and furnish illustrative instances, culminating with my own viewpoint.\n\nOn one hand, the ubiquity of similar shops and products presents several merits. Primarily, it bolsters accessibility and convenience. Consider the example of 7-Eleven stores; their standardized displays across various locations allow customers to swiftly locate their desired items, significantly reducing time consumption. Moreover, it cultivates heightened competition, resulting in lower prices and an array of choices for consumers. For instance, competitors offer distinct mobile phones with comparable functionalities but at competitive prices. Therefore, it is evident that these advantages expand the array of choices available to customers.\n\nConversely, there exist adverse aspects that warrant consideration. One instance involves the potential erosion of cultural diversity. For example, the modern Korean clothing style gains traction in numerous Asian nations, leading to the gradual disappearance of their traditional attire. Furthermore, the pervasive uniformity of products and stores might curtail individual choices. An evident illustration lies in the clothing industry, where the lack of tailoring to specific cultural norms could result in the loss of certain traditional clothing styles. Hence, the negative aspects should not be overlooked.\n\nIn summary, I advocate for a balanced approach, considering both perspectives. Personally, I contend that a balance should be struck, as certain products like mobile phones offer tangible benefits to consumers, whereas clothing may not be an ideal candidate for standardization. In the near future, increased awareness among businesses regarding customer-centric views may afford people more options, aligning with their individual needs when selecting products.",

The substantial influence of this movement has sparked  controversy over its potential impact in recent years. In my opinion, the former proposition appears to be more rational. This essay will further elaborate on both the positive & negative effects of this direction & thus will lead to  a logical conclusion.\n\nThere are myriad  reasons which will further explain this argument but the most preponderant one stem from the fact that international trade has increased exponentially in the last 2 decades due to technological advancement and brand establishments. Big brands like Zara, Gucci and Prada have their presence across the globe.  Another pivotal aspect of this argument is that Due to globalization, it has become convenient for buyers to buy products of international brands in their own country Needless to say, all these merits stand in  good stead.\n\nHowever, there are some pitfalls that negate this arguments & which can certainly overwhelm the potential influence of this direction but one of the most alarming one is that there is no diversity in designs. Similar designs can be found in different countries. Besides, countries lack the authenticity of their local products as they are available or listed on platforms like amazon which allows sellers to sell products internationally  Hence, it is apparent why many are against this tendency.\n\nAccording to the arguments aforementioned above, one can reach  a conclusion that the benefits of global business are instrumental indeed.

    "essay": "Certain individuals contend that governmental entities ought to strive for the reduction of environmental pollution and housing challenges, with the intention of alleviating illness and maladies. I completely agree with the notion, for through the resolution of these interrelated issues, administrations can substantively ameliorate public well-being and curtail the burden on healthcare systems.\n\nFirstly, curbing water pollution can abate waterborne diseases. Tainted water sources have the potential to shelter pathogens responsible for afflictions such as cholera and dysentery. Additionally, diminishing air pollution levels can significantly curtail respiratory ailments. Pollution air laden with particulate matter and noxious gases exacerbates conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, thereby fostering an environment conducive to respiratory infections. The World Health Organizationâs estimation, which indicates that ambient air pollution, for instance, contributes to over four million premature deaths annually underscores the gravity of this concern.\n\nFurthermore, adequate housing conditions can thwart the proliferation of vector-borne diseases. For example, densely populated habitats in slums often become breeding sites for disease-transmitting mosquitoes, further amplifying the susceptibility of malaria and dengue fever. By providing habitable dwellings with proper ventilation and sanitation, governments can stymie the transmission of these diseases. Moreover, inadequate housing aggravates psychological well-being concerns, inciting conditions such as hypertension and anxiety, stemming from the absence of a stable and congenial residential environment.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly concur that to avert illnesses, authorities must preemptively address ecological contamination and housing challenges, since by doing so, societies can expect healthier populations, reduced disease encumbrances, and ultimately, more robust and sustainable healthcare systems.",

While some believe that the costs of environmental and housing enhancement should be reduced to deal with such issues, I, however, disagree with the statement and believe that this development should not be deducted because of various reasons which will be elaborated on in this essay.\n\nTo embark on, environmental development brings numerous benefits to citizens in the country. This is not only about improving the environment  but also enhancing individualsâ well-being as it tends to decrease different pollution which could be stimulated into the human body that causes serious health problems. For example, reducing gas emissions from industrial businesses potentially lowers the causes of various diseases, cancer in particular.\n\nLikewise, encouraging the government to ignore housing problems introduces certain people to several unhealthy problems. In other words, due to the increasing number of homeless individuals, they receive a large amount of air pollution while living without habitats. Moreover, those may have terrible dietary habits, leading to some illnesses such as food poisoning and starvation.\n\nNevertheless, some people may opine that physical well-being is hindered by such environmental and housing development. In short, it is required to make a large expenditure for handling such problems, potentially causing the governmentâs financial burden, resulting in less budget to protect residents from unhealthy. Conversely, it is suggested to allocate the money to combat health problems instead. For instance, the government should invest in health research to advance the technology related to well-being. Additionally, they should subsidize healthcare expenses for citizens, especially for those who facing poverty issues.\n\nIn conclusion, while some people may argue that the budget for environmental and residential issues should be allocated to handle healthcare sectors, I personally disagree with this solution and think that these developments are crucial for citizens. If the environment and inhabitant development are ignored, it will significantly cause remarkable serious health issues for numerous residents.",

Certainly, the administration must resolve this trouble or provide the best acceptable solution. For instance, building new apartments for homeless citizens, and as a result of that, this convenience helps them to live in comfort. Admittedly, the council should decline environmental problems such as car emissions containing damaging pollutant particles which can contaminate air and water. Either way, they must rectify this crucial and vital problem.\n\nOn the other hand, it is not only the government's shoulder but also our responsibility to take care of our environment because nature can exist without us , but, we can not live without nature. Instead of complaining about every negligible thing we should attempt to save and keep cleaner our environment.\n\nIn my opinion, the authority should focus more on downsizing  contaminations and constructing civilian houses by decreasing housing disadvantages these actions can cause the best solution.

While many people argue to prevent illness and disease, others think environmental pollution and housing problems are more important than them. In my opinion, each problem starts with hygiene and economical situation so, it's more important to reduce environmental pollution and housing problems. \n\nAll the public's problems should be fixed by the governments and I think any kinds of pollution are the most serious problem because it causes diseases.  Many crowds suffered from a lack of nutrients, clean water and air. Unless they don't access clean resources and the environment, they get sick easily. Of course, experts should work on vaccines, other diseases or health facilities. If these problems solve in earlier, diseases won't exist ever. Moreover, housing problems are similar to environmental pollution, they are directly related to many illnesses. Also, if people have got their own house and enough income, many diseases never exist. Government should try to improve each individual's income so, their life expectancy would be better. Furthermore, many illnesses are related to morale. While people are living in  leaner areas, their life would be longer and healthier. \n\nAuthorities are charged of solving communities' problems.

Even though this has brought many benefits like communicating easily and being less costly, this also has some drawbacks such as a lack of physical interactions.\n\nIt is true to say that many people can communicate easily because of digital technology.  In the past few decades, people need to use snail mail as their primary communication method and which was unreliable because it did not have proper encryption methods or solutions. While using some online communication channels like Facebook or Twitter, people's messages are encrypted by advanced encryption methods. In addition, there is no extra cost to use those channels and that is the major advantage compared to the traditional communication technique. Although it would be difficult to use for older people, many applications today are mostly user-friendly and easy to manage it. In the UK, for example, many older people are learning how to use the internet properly from their grandchildren.\n\nHowever, digital technology can limit physical interactions between human beings. During the COVID-19 period, a large number of people are using digital platforms to continue their education, work, and family gathering. As a result, many people prefer to stay at home rather than go to the physical offices, schools, and their relative's or parents' homes. This can seriously impact their relationship and younger generations also may think that they do not require to meet other people in the future as well. \n\nTo conclude, though digital communication has its drawback, this can bring many benefits to our society.

    "essay": "Recently, a panel of virologists, along with a few environmentalists are investigating the relationship between the spreading of pandemics and the layout of modern cities. Some concur with the idea that there is a strong correlation between the two factors. As far as I am concerned, it is not the whole picture yet.\n\nAdmittedly, housing factors are influential in the spreading of the virus, since poor housing condition naturally transfers to over-crowed residential buildings, which often leads to poor hygiene and infection. Covid-19 was a hard lesson. Owing to the fact that throngs of people were living in relatively small areas in Wuhan, the virus spread rapidly in and beyond the densely-populated megacity, causing incalculable loss of life and property. Thus, it is reasonable to support that government should invest money in developing more residential areas.\n\nNonetheless, the government had better invest money in launching an awareness campaigns to prevent eruption or reoccurrence of diseases. What specifically prevents people from getting infected is not any external matter but rather  hygienic awareness. It often turns out that those who are free of diseases are not the ones who are living in secluded and clean areas, but the ones who do well on self-protection instead. Covid victims would not have been infected if they knew what leads to infection, nor would the entire area be afflicted if its people have had good hygienic awareness however poor the condition was.\n\nBesides, drug companies must be financially supported, because they are truly  life-savers. Pandemic or even cancer will not matter much if they are curable by medicines, after all, anything that can be treated by pills means no more than an ailment to modern people. Furthermore, drug companies can hardly yield valuable products without financial aid from the government, considering the colossal amount of money takes to design and test the drug molecular. For these reasons, drug companies must not be overlooked by the government.\n\nSimply put, it is true that improving housing conditions prevents the eruption or infection of illnesses, but the governmentâs primary concern should go to enhancing hygienic awareness in its people as reason mentioned above. Last but not least, it is essential for the government to provide subsidies for drug companies.",

    "essay": "No doubt, peopleâs health is influenced by the environment and housing conditions. That is why some people opine that governments should focus more on the environment and housing to prevent various ailments. While I do admit that these areas require attention, in my opinion, by simply addressing environmental pollution and housing scarcity, we cannot see much of an improvement in public health.\n\nIndeed, environmental pollution and dirty surroundings cause many health problems. For example, air pollution is a major issue in cities and, consequently many urban residents suffer from respiratory ailments. Lack of access to clean water is another problem that millions of people face in poor countries. Unhygienic surroundings are the breeding grounds of mosquitoes and fleas which spread many diseases. Therefore, if the government looks into environmental pollution and provides basic housing amenities, such problems can be avoided to a great extent.\n\nNevertheless, simply focusing on the environment and housing will not prevent all diseases. The government has to do much more. It has to allocate a portion of its budget to prevent diseases through vaccinations. It should also spend on screening tests through which serious diseases such as cancer can be detected long before actual symptoms occur. In earlier ,stages most cancers are totally curable through inexpensive treatments. Launching health awareness campaigns is another thing governments can do to improve public health. Even if the government provides housing to all, diseases can still spread if people are ignorant and allow stagnant water to collect in their surroundings.\n\nIn conclusion, although giving priority to environmental issues and housing will improve public health, a lot more has to be done to eradicate diseases.

By delving into the past of their homes, they can establish a link with previous inhabitants, thereby fostering a sense of continuity and attachment.\n\nMoreover, the value of historical preservation has gained prominence in recent years, with more individuals recognizing the importance of conserving architectural heritage. Learning about the past of a house or building contributes to this preservation effort, as it enables the current occupants to appreciate the significance of their dwelling and potentially safeguard it against future alterations or demolitions.\n\nTo satiate this thirst for historical knowledge, there are several avenues that can be explored by individuals. Firstly, local archives and libraries can provide a wealth of information, ranging from old maps and photographs to records related to construction and ownership. These resources can help to piece together a comprehensive narrative of the buildingâs past. Another fruitful approach involves engaging with neighbors or previous occupants, who may possess valuable oral histories and anecdotes that illuminate the lived experiences of the space.\n\nIn conclusion, the surge in interest regarding the history of oneâs accommodation can be ascribed to the quest for belonging and the increasing awareness of the importance of architectural heritage. Utilizing local archival resources and engaging with community members can prove to be effective methods for conducting this research, enabling individuals to forge a deeper connection with their homes and the past that shaped them.",

Moreover, this process can be done by uncovering interesting stories and hidden details of the area. \n\nFirst of all, one of the most common reasons to find out the backstory of a place is backed by the urge to connect with their living spaces in order to live comfortably.

Furthermore, people might wish to recapture the memory of living with their parents, grandparents or the felling of living with their young siblings in the childhood.\n\nTo begin with the investigation, a number of sources can be used to discover the history. The first thing should be done, it's to ask the senior family member, usually they know most things about the house where they lived in and they are glad to share the story within the house. Also it will be helpful to get some answer from the senior neighbor of the house. Finally, online searching is a good way as well, if the house has some special history it might be more easier to find from internet.\n\nIn conclusion, discovering the history of one own's house is a reasonable action and it has multiple meaningful matters for a family.",

    "essay": "In many nations, people are searching for more information about their accommodations. Several measurements are considered to know about the purposes and history of their living places.\n\nTo begin with, learning about the history of their own houses has a number of profits, people may be aware of former owners of their homes.For example, the former owner of the house was a famous actor, and the last one would advertise or sell  the house for an increased amount of money. Besides that, the most important factor to know the history of accommodation is to repair damaged things or alter them. If accommodation was not built with proper materials  a long time ago, it would be significant to repair and change. Many government agencies, for instance, announced the usage of buildings for roughly 50 years of limited law. After that, the building should be repaired or destroyed.\n\nOn the other hand, the most beneficial way of learning about building is to use the internet. It can give a lot of background to people that they may record or take videos of events. Nevertheless, a private flat is located in the suburb of the town, it will be a good chance to ask  local people. They have been living there for a long time, so it is more effective to get knowledge of neighbourhoods. For example, a person who relied on the advertisement by telemarketing decided to buy a house in the suburbs. Fortunately, he came  home directly and indigenous people said about the  history of that house that all members of the family were killed. So thatâs why, he could avoid an unlucky house.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no argument about the meaning of research on houses. In addition, using the correct methods to find is also important.",

The necessary individuals are fascinated to point out  the previous details of the house and building they stay in. In this essay, I will narrate some of the primary reasons for the problem and offer possible solutions in the following progress.\n\nOn the one hand, I think there are some causes that happen. The main reason is  selecting a peaceful environment. Although it is also significant to know about the neighbours. However, if they face problems to point out effective places as well as neighbours it would be an outrageous situation to stay there. Secondly, a few individuals are curious about the design and architecture of their accommodations. For an instant, an outdated building is a look at cutting-edge equipment. Furthermore it is not only important to discover the history of the house on the building but also know all the facilities like the road, supermarket and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, this is a common mindset among humans. There are several actions that could be taken into account to mitigate mentioned problems. First of all, advertising some famous social networks like Facebook and Instagram many more. Secondly, the mainstream newspapers will be assistive to finding conventional stories of house on the building.\n\nTo sum up, there are various factors leading to finding the history of people's accommodation.

Therefore, now we can see a considerable number of reasons why humanity started to learn about it and ways to find information. \n\nThere are several reasons for growing the interest in this subject. The first reason is simple interest, for example in my hometown there were plenty of tenement houses in the past that nowadays are residential. That is why many Saratov citizens want to search for information about their houses, especially if they live in the main street of the city. In my view, the second reason is sillier; some popular video bloggers now are doing shows on the subject and in this way, they attract peopleâs attention to this topic.\n\nI only see two ways to find this information here, and I suppose they are not safe. One way from this list is to try to find old archives that potentially may be secret and that approach would end up being illegal. The second option is easier and less dangerous; this method is asking neighbours about the house. In this ,situation we can meet difficulties too, such as a lack of neighbours who have lived there for a long time, or they just do not know any information about it. These ways are too perilous to satisfy.\n\nFinally, there are plenty of ways to achieve the goal of finding out about the history of the home, but most of them are sophisticated and make little sense.

They could also learn about the past architectural style which is distinct from todayâs modern and minimalistic design. Consequently, people may be more appreciative of the aesthetic and intrinsic value of these buildings.

The reasons for this trend are unknown, but possible reasons such as watching some mysterious movies or increasing human awareness are introduced. In this essay, I will scrutinize possible reasons for this change and the ways the community could achieve precise data.\n\nThe first and perhaps the most important reason for this attitude is releasing some movies that stimulate audiences' curiosity about the history of their houses. In such movies, there are some inhabitants seeking the past. Consequently, it leads to discoveries which are exciting for viewers. For instance, Dr. Morphy's House is a famous movie in this field which by searching precisely could find a hidden treasure in his basement room. After watching this movie, the number of people making efforts to find out more about their houses rose noticeably.  \n\nIn addition, the awareness and interest of individuals in  history have increased. With the development of the media and the internet, the public knows more about  history, and seemingly it would be an adequate reason for their seeking about the past. For instance, one of those interested in unfolding the historical events told me that after hearing about this matter that his neighbourhood was a safe place in World War 2, he was encouraged to collect information about the history of his accommodation. \n\nFor achieving this goal, people utilize various resources to become familiarized with the past and events taken place there. Books, the internet, and interviews with former inhabitants all are different ways to respond to their questions. \n\nTo sum up, there are various motivations for  individuals to know about the history of their houses.

People can look at these in a different way such as  interesting issues or economic products. Both of the ways grap peoples' intention. I am going to explain why the public is getting obsessed with finding out about the history of the house or building they live in and how can they find out information about it.\n\nFirstly, people are trying to research the history of places just because of their curiosity. For example, when folks move to the old house which was established so long time ago they probably care about who had lived here and want to find out whether there had been a famous person or not. Because some people believe that if someone who was really talented or famous they can get  positive energy from that person. This kind of thinking can occur with more older houses than new ones. Eventually, residents start to seek the document of their properties and I am of the opinion that they try to use the management structure of assets. Nowadays the system is quite well arranged in conjunction with the government and everyone can fulfil  research for finding the track of  history.\n\nSecondly, the public uses the timeline of buildings for trading itself. For instance, folks need to know detailed story of an apartment, especially a loan which is issued with the apartment, when they want to sell it to others. In this case, that information can be found in the national land management system which is operated by the government and the trade between seller and buyer will be reliable. Otherwise, all parties can not trust each other and making the contract is not that easy.\n\nIn conclusion, finding the root of the properties is significantly interesting to the public. Hence, the government has to rearrange the search system or rehabilitate the old method to find quickly what the public wants to know to follow customer's needs",

In this essay, I discuss about the reasons why people are eager to find out about the history of their building or house, and suggest the way to reach materials about them. \n\nI believe that there are two remarkable reasons why people want to research about the house or building. The most important one is that theses days, a number of people consider their own houses or  buildings  as real estate property. To be specific, they transact their apartments and mansiosn by making a sale or purchase them, which means that they believe that their houses could be effective means of investment, and they also have to know a huge deal of information about their products. Meanwhile, other people are likely to realize historical value of their buildings where they have constantly lived in. For example, if their buildings or houses are quite old, they would get intersted in gaining plenty of stories which the buildings or houses contain, which means that they would be keen to find structures and materials of the building, and a design paradigm related to the historical possessions. \n\nPeople who want to know about their own house could utilize many ways to get useful information. The most simple strategy is that just questioning to elder family members, and the neighborhood living nearby for a long time could play a critical role in providing conclusive information. In addition, it is also pretty efficient way for the people to search copy of a house deed, which is a document specifies the detail of a certain house. If people could prove that they have ownership of thier house or building, they would get the material in public offical or on the Internet. \n\nIn conclusion, when people start to be interested in their house or building for any reasons, they can take various steps to understand and appreiciate about their valuable and precious house or building.",

    "essay": "In this day and age, there is a developing trend in many nations, in which people are taking an interest in learning more about the accommodation they live in. The following essay is going to discuss the reasons behind this trend and how people could research it.\n\nTo begin with, learning about the history of the apartments brings several benefits to the owners such as having a better understanding of the power and water systems of the building. This is a piece of crucial knowledge, especially when the landlords need to conduct any repair or maintenance. For instance, the owners could locate the hidden pipe with ease in order to maintain it, saving them the time and manpower needed to handle the job. Moreover, looking for the past of the accommodations could help buyers avoid purchasing tainted houses. In many cultures, the reputation of the previous owner plays a vital role in the sale of the residence, and if the ex-owner had earned himself a bad name, buyers hardly consider that building a suitable choice. For instance, in Asia, if there was a death happened in the cottage, it is alleged that the customers would not choose to reside inside it for the rest of their lives. \n\nInvestigating the past of the buildings is quite an easy task, as the information about the dwelling is publicly listed on the Internet. However, the downside of this method is that this data is used to promote the sale, so any adverse features would be hidden or not fully presented, thus the customers could be in a stalemate if they do not carefully examine the house.

Since various natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes and storms can happen annually, by knowing about the past of a building people can be aware of the infrastructure and strength of the place they live in.

A good example of this would be prisons.

This essay will put forward some attributable factors of this trend and propose two effective measures to achieve the desired results.\n\nThere are two possible emotional and financial rationales for the increased number of people attempting to obtain historical insights into their homes. The first one is that most individuals are inclined to seek acceptance and belonging, and having a good grasp of the previous owners' life stories and the accommodation styles is an optimal way to place a person's life within a much broader context of time and place. That is to say, it significantly enables a person to create a lineage for their home and connect more profoundly with a sense of self and the preceding family's past, including obstacles they overcame and triumphs they celebrated. Another intrinsic point is that a strong comprehension of the dwelling's history may also help the new possessors diminish maintenance expenditures by tracing potential risks of damage related to materials, finishes, and utilities. For example, it would be substantially costly to mend an electrical malfunction if a landlord had no accurate and reliable data on the structure.\n\nFortunately, there are several straightforward ways for people to investigate their residenceâs yesteryear. The first of these is, unquestionably, through the power of the Internet. The helpful resource on virtual forums and websites such as NARA, Family search and Cyndi's list can empower the owners to run a reverse trace with the houses and use the advanced filters to explore the movements of their ancestors. The second valuable channel is official records, containing backups and guesstimates about the constructions and renovations. This is because every governmental agency has a preservation officer who can guide a homeowner to the right resources such as the archives, local city and town historical societies and relevant details about the former dwellers.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no doubt that a greater appreciation of one's accommodation is advantageous mentally and monetarily to the holders.

In my opinion, we can bring positive changes by mending our ways which include saving the biodiversity by increasing the awareness among the people. This essay discusses both aspects and provides  logical grounds for both by stating the facts.\n\nTo begin, since the establishment of man on this earth, humans have disturbed the balance of the ecosystem by exploiting it.Deforestation and, emissionthe emission of greenhouse gases have posed serious threats to our natural saviours such as the ozone layer. For example, the increased amount of gases released by refrigerators has caused the depletion of the protective layer. Consequently, animals and plants are more prone to harmful rays coming from the sun. Moreover, deforestation has led to more frequent floods, land sliding and a hike in salinity. As a result of these activities, some people are of the view that there is no going back. The loss done to the plantation as well as animals including their habitat is irreversible.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a wide majority of optimistic people who believe that it is still not too late to make this world a better place for our natural counterparts that are plants and animals. The condition of Flora and Fauna can be improved with drastic changes in our lifestyle and paying heed to their vital role in our environment.

Day by day, the population has increased significantly. Food and housing are basic requirements of humans. So, they destroy due to erosion to fulfil their requirements. As a result,  thousands of species are homeless and they can not live without food, at the end the biological cycle breaks down and animals or plants extinct. For example, Asian white elephants have been extinct since 2010. It is the result of the deforestation in the Asian forest. Some of the activities are irreversible. Hence, we can not do this in this situation.\n\nOn the other hand, it is not too late to take action against human activities to protect the environment. Firstly, the government should enforce strict action against erosion, they should ban these types of activities which negatively affect  different species. Moreover, we live on the planet so it is also our duty to save nature. For instance, 8 billion people live in the world and if only they had one tree per person, in the end, we will have planted 8 billion trees. Parallelly we also should protect wilderness which is endangered in the near future.\n\nIn conclusion, we can do it when everyone understands the situation. It is our responsibility to save the world from negative impacts.",

    "essay": "Recent years have witnessed relentless debates over the disastrous impacts of humans on the environment and whether there are still ways to remedy situations. It is believed that it is too late for any corrective measures. From my perspective, this opinion is invalid to a certain extent. This essay will elaborate on my belief. \n\nPerhaps for many, there are some irreversible environmental impacts that make some people think that any attempts to fix the current situation are futile. First, humans have been exploiting myriad rainforests every year, which deprives thousands of animals of their habitat. This deforestation has also led to global warming, and the implication is that the ice in the Arctic melts quickly, causing numerous deaths of animals such as the polar bear. Second, plenty of endangered creatures are predicted to vanish despite the measures taken by human beings. This is because many food chains are detrimentally affected by the disappearance of certain vegetation and animals in the ecosystem, leading to a shortage of food and then the unstoppable death of other organisms. \n\nDespite the valid argument detailed above, I believe humans are begging to be different. The most pertinent point is that governments can enact laws to ban illegal acts that pose a threat to natural habitats. To exemplify, the Vietnamese government introduced laws on industrial waste management in 2001, which deterred factories from discharging waste into rivers and oceans without proper treatment processes. Another justification is that the awareness of residents about environmental issues needs to be raised. Only by this would people avert their destructive behaviors on the environment, which would give us a chance to bring back the primal state of the Earth. \n\nIn conclusion, it is indisputable that human beings have devastating effects on this planet. However, it is my genuine belief that some viable policies would be sanctioned to prevent further repercussions and hopefully restore the environment.",

    "essay": "In this day and age, human activities undoubtedly have detrimental impacts on organic life forms. While many people argue that any solution to tackle this dire problem is too late, others believe that the situation can still be improved by taking effective measures. In the following essay, I am going to discuss both sides of the argument and state my opinion. \n\nMany individuals think that any effort to solve the irreversible damage of human civilization on nature is overdue. This is due to the fact that this issue has lasted for several decades without any effective intervention. Simply put, over the course of history, civilizations have driven a large number of plants and animals to the verge of extinction for a host of reasons, whether to satisfy our personal gains such as collections or deforestation, or false rumours. For instance, during the past decade, a fabrication stating that rhino horns can cure almost every disease known to man, caused poachers to hunt down rhinos to collect their horns, meanwhile collectors would pay a fortune to gain access to these rumoured magical cures. Consequently, the number of rhinos drastically decreases, and despite any effort to preserve this endangered species, rhinos die out owing to the fact that the remaining specimens cannot mate and reproduce. Moreover, humans also cut down forests to make room for agriculture and construction sites, causing numerous species to lose their natural habitats. These are only a few examples of the harmful impacts of human activities on nature. \n\nOn the other hand, many solutions can be utilized to improve the situation. First of all, technology has been innovated in our time, and many of these innovations have the potential to enhance the natural habitats of plants and animals. In todayâs world, scientists have developed numerous ways to protect and preserve, as well as replicate endangered species in laboratories and provide necessities for their growth after releasing them into the wild. For example, an extinct herb has been recreated and nurtured in an ideal atmosphere, and researchers would take special care to guarantee its flourishment after planting them on suitable grounds. Furthermore, nowadays awareness of society about the detrimental effects of human civilizations on natural life has been raised, so people are increasingly concerned with conserving organic living forms. Taking bears as an example, people in Vietnam used to hunt and kill bears to extract bear gall, however, this practice has gradually been abandoned thanks to the education of the government. \n\nIn conclusion, the reason that leads individuals to believe that any measure to deal with the negative effects of humans on nature is overdue is that it has lasted for too long. Nevertheless, several methods can be taken into account to solve this situation, such as the application of technological innovations in conserving wildlife. From my point of view, human effects on wildlife can be reversed using technologies and raising social awareness about biodiversity.",

    "essay": "Whether leaders or directors of organizations should be old people or young people is being widely discussed currently. From my perspective, I think young people should lead the team.\n\nThe reason that young people are suitable to become leader is that they have higher ability in acquiring new knowledges. As a result, they may have greater advantages in some new areas like the Internet. The young people have the willingness and ability to adept and adjust new technology as they are less experienced than old people. They may be more broadminded and can easily accept new thoughts, which makes them understand current trends and make plans that are suitable to deal with new problems.\n\nHowever, the old people are more experienced than young people, which is a significant advantage. As they have been working for a long time, they may experience some complex situation and enough practice to deal with those problems while young people may get nervous or have no idea about what to do when they face some accidents. Whatâs more, old people are less moody, which makes them steady and think twice before making decisions. \n\nIn my point of view, I think that leaders can also be the young people. They have stronger bodies so they are less likely to be ill, which gives them ability to lengthen working hour and higher ability. Whatâs more, according to the researches, young people may be more concentrated when working while old people have to relax from time to time, so young people may work more efficiently and effectively. Moreover, the young people may not get married, so they do not need to worry about work-life balance. They may put most of their time on work and leadership, while old people have to spare some time to their family.",

    "essay": "Centuries ago when people discovered land and islands they did affect negatively the biodiversity of the planet. Even now, industrialisation, deforestation and urbanization developments have a huge impact on various species of animals and plants, leading to endangerment and disappearance. Some think that those effects are irreversible and can not be improved, whereas others believe that taking any measures may assist with preserving the remaining ones. I strongly believe that it is possible to keep them alive and save endangered organisms at least. \n\nTo begin with, it is not late to reconsider humans' priorities and decisions,before decisively ruining the ecosystem by diminishing them. There are possible ways of solving this issue, which commences from intentions and faith that every inhabitant of the earth should have. Moreover, the government plays a big role in tackling it, by imposing strict laws in order to combat illegal logging and the deleterious effects of agricultural practices. Also, there should be organised organisations or groups of people who help to preserve creatures and plants from poaching and trampling. Hence, everyone must exert influence on the local environment and its dwellers. \n\nHowever, it is can be denied that a plethora of bio-organisms is fading away as humans do not stop using natural resources incessantly and litter shelters of exotic types of wild animals or plants. Therefore, believers claim that the vital majority of diverseness already has gone and the minority of those will become extinct in 2-3 decades. This will be accurate, for example by 2050 the creatures such as the tiger, koala, polar bear and even elephant will extinct from our planet. Furthermore, if humans do not halt dumping waste,oil or leftovers, sea creatures are suffering and it may lead to another tragedy. \n\nTo recapitulate,human activities damaged the planet including the animal and plant species. However, it seems to me that humanity can overcome this challenge by working together towards preserving the rest of the species.",

    "essay": "The most serious issue that many countries face is the harmful consequences of human activity on plant and animal species. However, some say it is too late to change the situation, while others believe we may improve it through practical actions. In my opinion, individuals should recognise the gravity of the situation and work tirelessly to find a solution.\n\nSome people believe that it is too late to protect the environment or animals. Around the world, the economy is growing. That suggests that many countries are focusing on the rate of economic growth while ignoring the destruction of the environment. As a result, they believe that doing nothing is pointless. Because people burned trees to expand cities, the solid has become sand in several Chinese cities, for example. In addition, the population in these cities is rapidly increasing, while vegetation and animals are rapidly declining.\n\nOn the other hand, some people thinkÂ that we can control and affect the environment in which we live. The reason for this is that as technology advances, we will be able to find more ways to conserve plants and animals. Furthermore, everyone recognizesÂ the need of preserving the environment.\n\nFurthermore, biodiversity is a highly significant topic that most scientists are studying. It is our responsibility to keep the health balance of the chin of food. So we should explore various methods to safeguard plants and animals because we can live without them. Some industrialised countries, for example, have introduced rules to safeguard the environment and urge individuals to learn how to avoid destroying it. This is the more prudent method of instilling hope in people.\n\nTo summarise, environmental protection is one of the most important things that everyone should undertake. Although it will not be simple, we must do it one step at a time.",

    "essay": "There is an immensely controversial perspective heating up a debate over how people can preserve the environment of flora and fauna.While some hold a strong view that it is run out of time to do anything, the opposite makes a statement that we should take efficacious measures to enhance this situation.While the former is valid to some extent, I consider myself an advocate of the latter.\n\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, there are considerable convincing reasons to express that it is run out of time to process formidable humanâs reckless action to natural habitat, especially deforestation. In this day and age, the ever-increasing demand of people for lands to live and wood to consume, for means of industrial, agricultural and residential purposes, is the main drive to habitat destruction of flora and fauna. For example, the indiscriminate destruction of forest-based land in China pushes many categories of rare animals, especially pandas to the brink of extinction. Thus, the environment of plants and animals is indiscriminately abolished and lost completely instead of being replaced, which is the main reason people think itâs too late to deal with this alarming issue.\n\nWhile the consequences of human actions leading to  habitat destruction are widely acknowledged, there is an eclectic mix of methods to enhance this dire matter. In todayâs modern society, constructing  conservation to create a safe environment for a great many animals that are endangered and threatened by extinction is an efficacious solution. For instance, in Vietnam, the Cuc Phuong reservation was under construction by the Governmentâs supervision, which houses ample distinctive species of flora and fauna. Hence, there still are considerable ways to protect the natural habitat and itâs not too late to deal with this alarming problem. \n\nTo conclude, itâs not run out of time to handle this serious matter, so people should be well-acknowledged and participate to preserve the environment of flora and fauna.",

    "essay": "Environmental conservation has become a trending topic in recent years. Pessimists claim that there is nothing that can be done to save the Earth, while others argue that human beings still have a chance to modify the situation. In my view, I agree with the latter and I will provide an explanation with examples.\n\nFirst of all, it is undeniable that human activities have brought a number of serious problems to the Earth due to the increase in human demands based on populations. For instance, the average temperature has increased one Celsius since the 1800s, which mainly caused by deforestation, farming and burning fossil fuels. This leads to a threat to many Arctic species such as polar bears in particular as their habitat is melting and disappearing.\n\nOn the other hand, others including me believe there is still hope because the awareness of environmental protection and sustainable development has raised in recent decades. To be more precise, many countries have started to tackle the negative effects brought by human beings, like reducing overexploitation of natural resources. Instead, professionals are researching and finding other renewable and Eco-friendly resources to limit the demands on fuels. Besides, afforestation is encouraged to offset the damage by deforestation. China is one of the best examples, which the overall forest coverage rate has risen from twelve per cent in the early 1980s to twenty-three per cent currently. As a result, the air quality in China has improved dramatically compared with thirty years ago.\n\nIn conclusion, even if human activities have caused grave consequences and even some permanent damage to our plants and wildlife, it is not completely irretrievable as long as human beings can learn from previous mistakes and insist on sustainable development.",

While many people believe that the fate of the earth is doomed, others are of the opinion that there are still chances of reviving it, if preventive measures are taken. In this essay, I will delve into both views and provide my support for the latter view.\n\nIt is undeniably true that humans have gone too far in exploiting earthâs natural resources and many believe that it is futile to even try to save it. I believe the main reason for this thought is our inherent selfish nature. Many people would rather live comfortably utilizing all resources rather than worry about the future generation. Therefore, it is quite evident that people are not ready to come out of their comfort-zone, despite knowing that they are destroying the earth.\n\nOn the other hand, it is never too late to take steps to protect our planet from further damage. This is because there are numerous initiatives and organizations already in place waiting to get the necessary support and funds from the government and common citizens. This could be achieved by taking small steps such as placing billboards on the busiest traffic intersections or posting relevant energy conservation tips on the social media. Since a majority of the population uses the subways for their daily commute, posters could be pasted on the subway walls as well. Obviously, we can do a lot if we stand united.\n\nIn conclusion, even though, it may seem like there is nothing we can do about the present state of our planet, it is never too late to take preventive measures.

However, either the government or society are take the same amount of responsibilities to protect our earth. \n\nThe main factor of environment damage is the rapid growth in industrial sector that require deforestation in several areas. The deforestations are causing a deficiency in O2 and increase our earth temperature. Jakarta, for example, is a humid city and every day the temperature consistent in around 29-31 celcius degree. That is because the city did not have enough trees, and the majority of open lands are allocated to build high buildings.

    "essay": "For over the last two or three decades, environmental degradation is a major world problem. Mankind activities are being put the ecosystem in a worse condition compared to the past. In this essay, I will look at the reasons for this and propose some solutions.\n\nInitially, air pollution has deteriorated as time goes by since we as a human mostly drive our own cars because of their convenience and deliberately make conurbations cover by clouds of pollution all the time. As proven by statistics, vehicles exhaust fumes in an enormous amount and it rises into the atmosphere which makes the condition insurmountable. For instance, most cars on roads are transported by one passenger ;therefore, if these drivers utilized public vehicles, this would diminish the amount of pollution. To tackle this problem, the government should enhance taxes on fuel as well as launch several campaigns to enthuse citizens about public transport vehicles. \n\nSecondly, the majority of factories are working hard to present all demands. It means they burn fossil fuels as high as they can and as a result, emits greenhouse gases into the globe whereas this amount was very low in the past. In addition, these harmful gases contribute to global warming along with melting the polar Ice cap and it happens because of nations' materialistic view. For instance, my cousin has several newly bought outfits that she never wears most of them. A solution is for the power to put a ban on burning high amounts of fossil fuels by factories along with encouraging communities to recyclable objects rather than new ones. \n\nIn conclusion, air pollution is getting worse and worse, and unless we preclude this devastating situation from continuing by way of using public transport systems and paying attention to recycling schemes to conserve our planet.

In consequence, both manufacturing companies and people must be accountable for environmental protection.\n\nThere are two principal factors that inflict environmental dilemmas. One of those is industrialisation, in fact, many wastes including oil and chemicals from factories and warehouses are being thrown into the environment. They contaminate the water which causes water pollution and makes lots of aquatic animals lose their habitats. Moreover, the waste is also being thrown into landfills, ruining the fertility of the soil which decreases the productivity of crops and other vegetables. Vehicles are also another factor, the emission from private cars can produce a lot of carbon dioxide which leads to global warming. As a result, by all of that, the precious ecosystems will be in danger. \n\nTherefore, not only large corporations and governments should take responsibility but also individuals. Firstly, the governments should take action to stop people from destroying the environment by introducing stricter legislation. This can be applied to all citizens, especially companies that prevent them from releasing more waste. Furthermore, if people infringe the law, then heavy fines and punishments will be put into practice. In terms of large corporations and individuals, improving self-awareness is the most important thing. They are able to take courses or read about how bad the environment is so that they can protect the ecosystems; factories are also capable of reducing waste with renewable energy. \n\nIn conclusion,  the deterioration of the ecosystem is the result of countless human activities, so both governments and each individual have their own part of the duty to make the environment better.",

In short they waste ample oftheir time on internet surfing. They do not bother to read something related to what is happing around them nor they are interested. International news as a mandatory subject in school can provide a good opportunity to the students to study and be aware of what is happening around the globe.\n\nSecondly, Many students find it boring to read newspaper or watch news on Television, Studying it as a subject will not only keep them updated from the surroundings also make it fun and fruitful while studying it with their fellow students.\n\nOn the other hand many people thinks that it is a waste of time to study news as a subject in school, I do not agree with this statement hows can gathering information be a waste of time? Does it even makes a sense? Furthermore, every school has physical education period or a library period playing outside classroom or reading general books are not waste of time then?\n\nMoreover to conlude I will say anything which gives us some knowledge can never be entiled as a waste of time, schools school inculcate all types of study branches in their education system so that no student can left behind in any span of knowledge.

    "essay": "Art has been debated in many ways since mankind began to think about what is the ideal curriculum for children's education.  Many people believe that art is a very necessary object to educate children, while others believe that it's wasting time. Overall, in this essay, I will have a discussion on both views and share my point of view in the relevant aspect. In my opinion, art is an essential factor in the educational life of the children. \n\nOn the one hand, some people think that children should be surrounded with specific lessons such as mathematics, science. In order to prepare them for the business world and the harsh conditions of life, they should be made familiar with certain subjects. To illustrate this, if they are successful in mathematics, they can achieve a satisfactory result in their university or college exams. In other words, if children want to apply to a highly recommended college, they need to make sure that their maths and science scores are at least at A-level in Turkey. Therefore, some parents believe that their children should not spend their time studying arts subjects. \n\nOn the other hand, children who try to learn some arts subjects can be more successful not only in their educational life but also as versatile personalities. For example, playing a musical instrument can give children self-confidence and an invaluable advantage at the start of their educational life. In addition, research shows that children who can play an instrument can learn a foreign language more easily than others who cannot play anything. In addition, the learning of the arts provides children with the ability to self-evaluate and self-discover. Therefore, they can easily express themselves in the society and it brings more academic success. \n\nTo sum up, despite of many people that art is a waste of time, a good combined curriculum with mathematics, science and art marks can be provided significant promotion for children not only their educational life but also preparing them for the complicated life.",

    "essay": "People have varying opinions on the effectiveness of education. While some people believe that attending school is a waste of time, I agree with those who argue that there are valid reasons for all the subjects taught in educational institutions.\n\nGranted, it is easy to understand why some young people are disappointed with the results of their education, especially those who have a pragmatic approach and expect immediate rewards from everything they do. Some businesses exist where theoretical competence is overshadowed by empirical knowledge. Let's imagine a hypothetical situation where two candidates compete for the position of either a car dealer or a real estate agent. If one of the applicants is a recent graduate from college and the other is an experienced salesperson without a degree, the former has less chance of winning.\n\nHowever, I choose to support those who believe that every course is worth learning and that it is only a matter of time before knowledge shines through. Living in an era of rapid change, few people can predict the future direction of the market. This means that anything we learn may not benefit us now but will be useful for our future careers. In the future world, what will be required are not just skilled workers, but individuals with multiple talents who can utilize various forms of knowledge and adapt to different roles. In contrast, utilitarians who ignore the importance of learning will be considered short-sighted and will inevitably be left behind by the new wave of business. The success of the famous film director, Woody Allen, serves as a convincing example. If it weren't for the seemingly useless knowledge of history, literature, music, and art that he had accumulated throughout his life, it would be impossible for him to tell so many wonderful stories in movies.\n\nIn conclusion, academic education may seem like a waste of time to those who are short-sighted. However, I believe that learning is one of the most valuable things we can do.",

    "essay": "While it is wildly claimed that it is wasting time to study art at school, others argue that it is a necessary subject for kids. In the essay, I will discuss both views and also state my perspective as the conclusion. \n\nTo begin with, it might be sensible for some to believe that other courses should be taught instead of art, seeing that most careers are not required this skill. For example, doctors,  do not have to draw any pictures to treat patients. However, if they want some figures, they can hire an expert to create those for them. Therefore, there are fewer chances for children to use this skill, if they do not have jobs that are related to arts such as artists or creators.\n\nOn the other hand, some opponents of this idea might propose that this subject is important for children since this has various benefits. Firstly, it can enhance the younger's image and this makes children become more creative. Moreover, this help student releases their stress. To illustrate, kids do not have to think about anything, they just draw and relax.\n\nTo conclude, although it is undeniable that it is a waste of time to learn this, I am of the opinion that it is essential for the younger  as the reason that creative or thinking outside the box is crucial to invent new things or having new ideas.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, a certain segment of individuals think that art is an essential subject for children at school. While others think it is a waste of time. In my opinion, learning something new and exciting for children is a productive approach. This essay will discuss both sides.\n\nOn the one hand, Art is a skill that involves  expression and imagination resulting in an amazing product. Many people think it is an essential subject for children at school. First, art was founded million years ago, with many historical references. For  example the pyramids in Egypt.  This indicatesand represents several skills and expressions.  It is an important subject for everyone, adults and young. Second, It has different forms such as drawing, dancing, and filmmaking. Children at school will get motivated  to learn about all of these exciting varieties. Third, young people are the new promise generation. The more they are educated, the more they will likely become  successful adults with optimum dreams.\n\nOn the other hand, some people hold their own thoughts, by saying and stating that art is a waste of time. Part of society thinks that instead of studying art they should study  proper educational subjects like, science, and math. Therefore, many parents came from different cultures and different beliefs.\n\nIn conclusion, art may be an important subject to some, however, it may not mean anything to others. In my opinion, children must learn about everything that is useful .

Some people argue that pupils at school should focus on subjects such as biology and mathematics, while others believe that art subjects also should be included in educational curriculum. In this essay i will explore both views and provide opinion.  \n\nOn the one hand it is clear that learning  science subjects like biology, math is significantly important to succeed in adulthood.  Furthermore, many people claim that children  need to pay attention only on studying subjects which related with technology, science, engeneering or healthcare because they can help to improve professional worth in the job market in future. These people believe that students should not waste time and mental resources on acquiring skills which not lead to get high-paying jobs.  \n\nOn the other hand it is necessary to remember that art teaches adolescents numerous useful skills and abilities namely creativity, problem-solving skill and stress resistance. These skills are crucial too in maturity which help to live fullfilling and happy life. For example according to the latest research found that people who studied at art classes in schools have also high earnings such as those who didnt. \n\nIn conclusion, Undoubtedly subjects which can be useful in the fields like engeneering, medicine and science are crucial.

    "essay": "Awareness of local and global issues is definitely important for all of us. Some are of the opinion that students must learn about them as a part of their curriculum. However, I agree with those who believe that it is a waste of precious school time. In the following paragraphs, I shall put forth my arguments to support my views.\n\nOne of the main reasons why some people opine that institutes must include international news as one of the school subjects is that it will incorporate knowledge about the current affairs. In this way, they will not only learn about the domestic and local problems, but also find ways to resolve them. For example, if the political science students learn about political issues of their country, they will be able to relate it to the books containing knowledge about it. In this way, they can find a variety of solutions to solve them which will help them in their career. In addition, it will help those students who want to go abroad for further studies to learn about the cultures of other countries as well. Thus, it is essential for academia to include global news in their syllabus.\n\nHowever, some individuals believe that it is a total waste of time for children to get an education about international disputes. One of the major reasons is that they are already burdened with other subjects namely, mathematics, science and a variety of other disciplines. They must concentrate on these particular areas to become experts in them. In addition, the inclusion of this discipline will only help those students who are studying this specific area like the faculty of environmental and political sciences. Therefore, it is not worthy at all to make it essential for institutes to involve reading newspapers as the subject. \n\nTo put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, although many hold the view that it is good for youngsters to know about world issues through the newspaper in curriculum, they can learn by themselves through various other mediums so there is no need to include them in academics.",

In addition to this, few people encourage talent and work, despite its pros and cons. In my opinion, I completely agree with the fact that art is a crucial part of any level of the student's life. In this essay, let's talk about both the conditions with examples when necessary. \n\n            To open with, we know that art is a form of talent which has a lot of strength in its creativity and logic, which makes parents a topic for it to be a growing subject for their children. They are a lot of analogies which can prove this statement, such as, children's draw images and some kind of portraits on their daily basis happening around them that correlate to the fact of his/her attention to others. This can also help them to understand and analyze different colors which can impact on memory. \n\n             To lead with, whilst the others have a view of it being a lost subject. Few analogies are, circulating myths that art cannot get a good paying job which is absurd in many ways. To add, this ideology in parent's minds came mostly from the neighbours and their influence. Another one could be of strangely little number of jobs with a penny sum amount earning.\n\n                  I firmly believe the fact that, art is an important and crucial subject at any level of student education. Doodling can help to relieve stress and ease the mind. Dance and Music, known to be as heaven of eyes and ears. Although, from my experience, I can definitely relate to the fact that I have lost my childhood of having no memories of me being interested in arts or in participation. Nevertheless, because of my passion, I have started to draw and learn a musical instrument. \n\n                All in all, every parent has a different opinion, but in common no one has to oversight their children's interest at the cost of their dream.",

    "essay": "Art is a way of expression and communication that started before we could even speak. For example, while studying history we can observe the drawings in the pre-historical caves. Whereas, nowadays we have many different ways of communicating due to several languages we have learned or with the help of technologies that humans invented. With this in mind, some people think that is an essential subject for children at school while others believe it is a waste of time. \n\nFirstly, for the ones who consider artistic values an important topic to be experienced in the classroom they perceive it as important for the development of the mind as mathematics or biology. Even so, scientific subjects could seem more useful, art history helps understand civilization itself. Furthermore, stimulating creativity is extremely educational for children. In the same way, imagination is very important in a child's life. Teachers and parents should take it seriously. \n\nNonetheless, on the other hand, others believe that studying artistic substances in class is a waste of time. Instead of taking more profit of school hours as long as learning logical skills to achieve a good career, painting or drawing is distractive for kids. For instance, education without these classes would be more efficient. \n\nIn my opinion, imagination is essential for the youngest either with teaching classes or alone at home. After all, it is fundamental for their growth. To summarize, even if creative subjects would be dismissed from normal education, parents should stimulate their kids.",

    "essay": "There have always been debates among people about studying art at school. Some believe in usefulness of this knowledge, but others are convinced that it is just waste of time. Both sides have their arguments, however, I am more inclined to agree with those who consider this subject worth studying.  \n\nOn the one hand, the great majority of adults cannot credibly argue that understanding of modern and art and classic music have helped them a lot in building their career or personal life. In this case, the idea of spending more time learning foreign languages and more practical things as math and physics seems to be quite reasonable. After all, according to common sense and statistics very few professions or occupations really require diving into art, even though most of schools have obligatory subjects of art in their programs regardless of inclinations of every particular child. For example, music was my most hated subject in school and seemed not to have influenced on my personality at all. \n\nOn the other hand, a well-rounded person who has in-depth knowledge and skills in arts definitely develops oneâs brain in such ways that enhance creativity and imagination. These qualities are very valuable in the modern world and could become a strategic advantage in fighting for higher positions and better jobs. A good illustration of such correlation is research, conducted in American schools. It discovered a significant improvement in test results within math and science classes which were involved in arts curriculum.\n\nIn conclusion, both points make sense, however I believe that arts have a great impact on humanâs outlook and schools have to provide opportunities for all to have access to art subjects, taking into account talents and desire of pupils and their parents.",

Although many people oppose the suggestion of having art as one of the subjects at school also, many people support this.

To put it in other words, many people strongly agree that, nowadays children are lacking  morals because of the unawareness of cultural values so, learning art subjects at school is necessary to alleviate this issue.

For instance, yoga will help students to calm and rejuvenate their mind and body as the consequences  will enhance their academic performance.

Some maintain that art should be an integral part of the study; however, there is another school of thought which dismisses this notion as they deem that it is the dissipation of time. In this essay, I will discuss both assertions and conclude that it is of paramount importance.\n\nThe most powerful argument in favour of art being on the school curriculum is its profoundly positive impact on the development of childrenâs cognitive skills. By participating in art activities, children deploy a wide range of accomplishments, like decision-making, thereby enhancing them. Not only can art help children have a fertile imagination, but also promotes lateral thinking in them. It can, therefore, have far-reaching implications, as this expertise are also crucial to learning other subjects; hence it appears logical to suggest that art improve outcomes in all subjects.\n\nNotwithstanding  these substantial benefits, it seems this subject is of no consequence to some. They point out schools should prioritise core subjects, like physics, arguing STEM skills are vital for studentsâ future lives and art is worthless. Given the fact that not all pupils have the opportunity to pursue their interest in art academies or at home, was art excluded from the school curriculum, they would not be able to understand the value of the arts, nor would those who are artistically inclined hone their skills. \n\nIn conclusion, I subscribe to the theory that art should be a part of the curriculum in view of the fact art education is critical to studentsâ personal and educational development, and it is inextricably linked to other disciplines as it can foster those skills also needed for them.",

While another group of individuals disagree with it, and they believe that knowledge been taught in primary schools is applicable to students. I personally agree that primary education is valuable for children in both building childrenâs social values and helping them with common sense.\n\nFirst and foremost, primary education can teach students basic knowledge which is able to be utilized in their daily life, such as counting and literate. Without these fundamental abilities, people would be difficult to survive in society independently, not mention cashing after higher education in the future. For instance, there is more than ninety per cent of positions required basic literate in the contemporary job market. So illiterates individuals might be hard to find a proper job after growing up. \n\nFurthermore, schooling can build studentâs social values such as respecting and socializing, and these merits are particularly essential to human beings when interacting with others. According to my experience, Chinese students are required to greet their teachers before each class, and they are absolutely not allowed to fight and bully other classmates. Under the regulations, young generations are taught to respects others and politeness which can be utilized in social life, and this can be beneficial to them when making friends or communicate with others.\n\nHowever, it is not saying that all knowledge in primary education is useful. A recent report shows that nearly thirty per cent of the information in elementary schools will not be used in the following decades. Besides that, it is undeniable that the enormous knowledge we have learnt in the classes has been forgotten after graduation. Hence, it seems crucial to change some curriculum of elementary education to be more practical.\n\nIn conclusion, even though there is some knowledge that might be not practical in real life, overall, I believe that the classes in primary schools are vital to individuals in terms of socialization and common senses.",

While some people cast doubt on the school curriculum, others believe its benefits. A closer look at both viewpoints will reveal that they are all credible.\n\nPeople who are sceptical about schooling must base on the following concerns. On the one hand, most of the childrenâs teaching at school focused on rote-learning, which may bring the young to swallow instruction without understanding. Instead of independent thinking and expressing their own opinion, children learn how to pass the test, which only has the short-term benefit and is not useful to their future life. On the other hand, given the wild changes of the world, a great amount of useful information can be accessed via the Internet, reading or watching TV. In this case, children can learn more in their fields of interest and do not need to follow the schoolâs teaching pace which does not suit every child. Such means that schooling is not the only or the best way for childrenâs learning.\n\nAlthough the aforementioned views somewhat dim the prospects of childrenâs schooling, it still carries some bright sides.

Furthermore, the youths learn  not only academic knowledge from school but also learn social skills and teamwork through getting along with classmates and teachers which cannot gain from studying alone.\n\nChildren studying at school have both strengths and weaknesses. In my view, it is undoubtedly that schooling is necessary for youths. However, to avoid the suspicion of school education, we need to make more effort to optimise the school curriculum.",

    "essay": "It is commonly thought that schools are the main educational place for teaching students how to recycle materials; other opinions express that the family environment has to educate to recycle properly.\nSchools are considered as the first educational background in our society, so for this reason teachers cover an important part: they have to teach from common subjects, such as geography and history, to the introduction of everyday topics in our daily life, as recycling. This phenomenon has been discussed a lot during this decade and it is fair that teachers speak about this argument with their pupils in order to learn how to treat our environment. Furthermore, it is a possibility to inform children, how much recycling is an important action in our society.\nOn the other hand, families have to be a good role model for their children and consequently parents should start to show them how to recycle from the earliest stages of their lives.\nI believe that both of these two environments have a key aspect in teaching how to avoid waste: first of all, they are the main two backgrounds where the youngest spend their time. As a consequence, each educator is responsible for an adequate education as regards recycling. Secondly, if they do not cooperate together, children will not be motivated to recycle then.\nTeachers and parents should discuss about a specific project in order to introduce pupils to such a delicate argument as the environmental sustainability together with the positive impacts that will create if everyone respects nature in our everyday life.\nTeachers could introduce leisure activities during the lessons, like quizzes and games that teach how to recycle, while parents should buy the right containers for recycling every material at home.\nIn conclusion, educational institutions and families have the same level of importance for teaching to children how to recycle. These environments should introduce daily habits and fun activities in order to offer a deep knowledge about avoiding to waste materials along with a reliable role model to follow in the future.",

    "essay": "Many people consider that it is important for children to learn art at school, however, there are others who opine that it is totally a wastage of student's study time. In my opinion, art is certainly as important as any other subjects because it helps younger children in learning history and in expressing themselves.\n\nOn the one hand, art is considered a useful skill as it allows children to learn about the history and cultural heritage of their nation. It is a well-known fact that the children better learn through images than text, therefore teachers use various art pieces to explain them many historical events. According to a survey, it was found that children who learned the story through snapshots were able to retain that information for longer duration as compared to others. Additionally, children learn to express themselves via creativity. Art helps children in communicating many concepts which they otherwise find difficult to explain.\n\nOn the other hand, many people believe that art is not an important subject to be taught at school because it does not add any value to their profile as other subjects such as math and science does. Simple mathematics calculations are always used in later stages of life, so it is important to learn the math at school level, but this is not the case with Art. Moreover, art does not help children in finding a job when they reach adulthood. This skill is not given much weightage by any employer.\n\nIn conclusion, art may not help children in getting a good job or may not be used in practical life when they reach adulthood, but in childhood it helps children immensely by encouraging them to learn about their culture.",

    "essay": "There is an opinion that studying art in schools is one of the fundamentals, meanwhile there are those who disagree and consider that teaching art is loss of time. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and then I will give my own opinion.\n\nOn the one side of the argument are those who believe that a schoolâs curriculum should include the art as one of the compulsory disciplines. This is because one of the crucial milestones in a childâs development is evolving creativity and a non-standard approach to solving problems.  While learning the art is a great tool stimulating a creation process.  For instance, the youngsters drawing on a daily basis have well-developed imagination and ability to express emotions through creation. \n\nOn the other side, there are people, who argue that the subject of art is necessary at school; by contrast, these individuals assume that studying it is meaningless activity. Nowadays, there are more important subjects to focus on at school, especially, exact sciences such as biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics. The main reason of it is that the humanity required much more high-teach engineers, qualified doctors and other STEM specialities. Thus, concentrating on the deepest teaching of a hard science will probably encourage the younger generation to choose this path for their careers. \n\nHowever, in my opinion, despite the fact that STEM specialists in a high demand in modern society, I believe that the art is one of the core disciplines. Owing to the fact that the art creation boost a personâs imagination and it is understood that engineers should be able to look at ordinary things from a different angle. \n\nIn conclusion, both sides have their merits. On balance, however, I consider that it is necessary for an educational program to include art as one of the essentials.",

What do you think? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.",
    "essay": "Having studied abroad, I strongly agree that learning international news should be made mandatory in secondary schools. This is because general grasp of global knowledge is vital in improving communication while overseas. These international news can also be used as precedent studies and even lessons for students to reflect upon.\n\nStudying abroad is slowly becoming a norm, particularly for students who graduated from secondary school. Therefore, basic grasp of general knowledge about other countries are essential, in which the easiest way to acquire them are through international news. Every individual arriving at a new country would want to instil a sense of belonging and be accustomed to the local culture. When I first arrived in Australia from Singapore, I often used international news as conversation starters with my coursemates. I received good impressions and were therefore warmly welcomed by my fellow Australian mates. After all, being familiar with the foreign countryâs affairs is a significant sign of an individualâs willingness to integrate with the local community.\n\nMoreoever, students can extract abundance of lessons from international news alone, be it a positive or negative aspiration. To illustrate, students from a rote learning education system can draw inspiration and knowledge from countries that offered alternative pedagogy methods such as vocational or elite sports school. In addition, secondary school students are at the critical age group where every moment is the deciding factor of their future. If these teenagers can learn from other countriesâ goods and bads and apply the lessons well, then the countryâs future is in safe hands of their youth.\n\nTo conclude, the claims of international news subject in secondary schools as a waste of time is preposterous. This is because students need these knowledge not only to bridge the communication gap with other countries, but also to reflect and apply the lessons for the betterment of everyone.",

    "essay": "The inclusion of the subject of Arts in the school's curriculum has been a controversial topic. While some people believe that adding this is futile, others believe that teaching Arts are crucial and should be taught in the school. This essay will shed light on both the views and put forward reasons why I agree with the latter view.\n\nTo begin with, one of the reasons why people argue that the Arts should be excluded is that this will be a burdensome task for the children. This is because the syllabus of other subjects is so vast that tutors often struggle to complete it in the allotted time. For instance, the schools usually run only for 6 hours a day, where the entire time is occupied in teaching subjects like Math, Science, History and Languages. Another reason is that people fear that this might digress students from focusing on  other important STEM subjects. This means that performance in other subjects will get impacted.\n\nNevertheless, there are also benefits of teaching Arts at the institution. One of the merit is that students learn how to express themselves. There are various forms of art which helps students discover their in-borne talents and abilities. To illustrate,  singing unleashes emotions and paintings demonstrates imaginations and creativity put down on a paper. Besides this, some forms of art offer great career opportunities. This means that if any student shows interest in any form of art, this can pave the path to build a career out of it. Needless to say, today the artist in the film industry, especially in India, is as successful as any other profession.\n\nIn conclusion, although the incorporation of teaching Arts subject in the school burdens the students and poses a risk of diversion, the identification of unique abilities and prospect of bright career is of more eminence.

I agree with former argument that art is impeccable for holistic mind growth in children.\nOn the one hand, it is often argued that there is no tangible benefit of studying arts. This is because there are very limited career prospects for people who study arts. For example, people with a qualification in arts often find it difficult to secure a job which is permanent and well paid. In contrast, people with a credential in other disciplines such as business, engineering or medical, conveniently find jobs which are not only permanent and well paid but also recognized highly in the society.  \nOn the other hand, I would disagree that since art is a useless subject because it does not offer a well awarded career. Teaching art at school level is essential for a holistic mind growth in children. Art allows children to not only explore their creativity but also enable them to express their ideas and emotions. This not only improve their communication skills but also enhance their emotional quotient which helps them substantially later in their future careers.\nIn conclusion, while other peopleâs opinions may vary, I think that art plays an inevitable role in the overall mindset development of children which helps them to enhance their communication skills and emotional quotient for their future challenges.

Because of these, students are not only involving in lectures but also participating in those events.

    "essay": "While few individuals have arguably put forward the statement that economic broadening is the only solution to put a halt to hunger and penury. Although, another group suggest that this growth will have a negative impact on the environment. The following essay will decipher both the viewpoints of this argument and outline my opinion.\n\nOn one hand, A country's gross domestic product (GDP), since it is linked with the economic widening, if improved, can lead to a decline in famine and poverty. Although a lot of factors contribute to the economic success of a country for example, if a person gets a quality education, it will lead to the self-advancement of that individual which in turn can be aligned towards the developing the economy by creating value through productivity like manufacturing and sale goods, services, etc. As a result ,this  will lead to a better standard of living for an individual and increased purchasing power which in turn saves he/her from sufferings like poverty.\n\nOn the other Flank, adverse effects can be reflected by economic development. for instance, in a recent ,study it was highlighted that due to increased purchasing power and living, a vast majority of people have occupied a lot of land, food, etc. which in turn creates a depletion of resources.furthermore because of the rapid growth, companies that have shared this growth have started deteriorating  nature through the release of harmful gases and pollutants from big industrial factories. this all makes the government officials as well the general public  rethink  the economic widening.\n\nHaving discussed the dichotomy, what I opine is that economic development is essential. As if an economy improves a lot of suffering can be mitigated. Although there are few worse effects that give a  bad reputation for this growth,  still it leads a country towards innovation.\n\nTo sum up, it can be rightly reiterated that economic growth is vital even though the demerits of this exist it should be considered equally and improving the lives of individuals will lead to prosperity and happiness instead of starvation.",

In my opinion, economic growth is the better for any country's overall development and it helps to prevent poverty and hunger by generating employment opportunties. I shall discuss both the views further in the subsequent paragraphs.\n\nTo begin with, some people think that there is only one way left to eradicate the poverty and hunger by doing economic progress. Firstly, economic enhancement creates more jobs for people in the country. Due to this, they can easily afford their expenses and stay away from poverty and hunger. Secondly, profits made by the corporations who are responsible for this financial growth will be converted into the financial benefits to be enjoyed by the straving and needy. \n\nOn the contrary, there are countless examples to support this view that economic growth results in environmental destruction. To increase the industrialisation in the developing countries, many lowland rainforests have been cleared and plethora of unsustainable agriculture practice introduced to produce cash crops for export. What is more, there are many factories  developing in countries to increase the international trade and it also enhance air pollution, which damages the enviornment at extreme level. For instance, continued use of fossil fuels, which provide energy for growing industrialisation, is causing global warming. It can lead to a rise in sea level, which will make millions of people in Bangladesh homeless.\n\nTo recapitulate, i would like to opine that economic growth must not be stopped unless, it is based on damaging the environment.",

In this essay, both views will be discussed and from my perspective, I strongly agree with the former statement.\n\nOn one hand, economic growth enriches the budget for society. As a result, those unlucky people can give more support such as food or money. That helps them a lot in improving their daily life. In addition, developed economy has the high demand in the number of employees. In other words, providing a huge amount of jobs which would reduce the unemployment state. Thus, the poor now not only get job but also have chance to change their life.\n\nOn the other hand, increase in the number of factories is an evitable consequence of economic growth. That causes harm to the environment because factories are the main source of exhausted emission and other kinds of contaminated trash. Polluted air, water and soil are the outstanding examples for environmental damage by the factories. Moreover, to expand the industrial area aiming to serve the development of economy, forest will be destroy to make use of land. That leads to series of negative effects such as increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, green house effect,â¦\n\nIn conclusion, the developed economy brings both pros and cons.

Some people are saying that the rapid growth of the economic development is the only way to end this situation while others are arguing that this should be stopped immediately as itâs destructing the environment. Following essay will discuss both aspects of this argument and outline my opinion on this matter.\nTo begin with, economic boost shows a certain countryâs wealth, hence itâs really important for everyone in the country.. Proliferation of economic growth will mitigate unemployment, hence it will boost peopleâs standards of living. For example, most of the developing countries are suffering from hunger and poverty, the only way to diminish this problem is that the authorities should take necessary actions to bring up the countryâs economy up to a standard where no one can suffer without having basic necessities.\nOn the other hand, rapid growth of a nation could bring detrimental impacts to the environment. For instance, waste comes out from industrial zones increases greenhouse gas emission which will be a direct impact to the global warming. Contemporary climate change situations throughout the globe is one good example of this state therefore this should be stopped.\nIn conclusion, even though the tremendous commercial boost can end hunger and poverty of a nation, I strongly believe that the governments should take necessary steps to minimize or prevent side effects which could happen along with this as that is how a country can protect the environment while improving their economy up.",

    "essay": "it is believed that government should increase the price of fuel for cars and other vehicles to tackle environmental issues. In my opinion, I partly agree with this point and give some reason for this.\n\non the one hand, it is undeniable that, the consumption of fuel for private vehicles has become increasingly large which leads to a huge number of carbon dioxide emitted into the environment. This makes a direct impact on human health and especially the atmosphere where humans and animals reside.  Therefore, increasing the cost of fuel can be the one solution to address this environmental problem. People will limit their need in utilizing their personal vehicles that required fuel. Instead, people have the tendency to commute by public transportation and take advantage of their car to travel to work if the distance is not too far or use a vehicle that consumes renewable or economical energy such as a electric car, or motorbike. In recent years,  some corporates have launched some kinds of vehicles that use renewable resources for example electric motorbikes and cars to encourage people to protect the environment. For example, in Vietnam, Vinfast have had a line of electric cars and motorbikes that are supported and used on a large scale of Vietnam. This is a good signal for the bright future of zero gas emissions in Vietnam.\n\nOn the other hand, the increase in the price of fuel makes it tough for some people that have low and medium incomes. This  can be a burden on their shoulders when they mainly rely on these gasoline vehicles to work and have no choice for another option. When the cost of fuel rise, they are the most vulnerable ones and have barely enough sum of money to pay for it for  an extended period. Therefore government also take it into consideration and issue the best resolution for this problem.\n\nIn conclusion, while increasing the cost is considered to be the way to mitigate the environmental issue, however, there are some circumstances that should be affected by this trend.",

While some people argue that it is an efficient way to solve environmental issues, I believe this effort is not the best solution for the environmental problem based on the following reasons.\n\nFirstly, increasing fuel costs is not an efficient way to combat environmental pollution. This is because, by increasing the costs of fuel, people still be able to choose other means of transportations to travel such as trains and buses. It doesnât deter or decrease the use of transportation which ultimately will still contribute to pollution. \n\nOn the other hand, there are other ways that can contribute to resolving the issues. One of the solutions is to increase taxes for oil and gas companies for drilling oil. With the increment of taxes, it will leave the company with no choice but to shut down drilling projects and stop any oil productions. Secondly, the government can work on providing incentives for the companies who contribute to renewable resources spending.  By providing the incentives on the company annual spending, the company will start exploring other options such as renewable or waste-based energy. \n\nFor instance, organisation like Woodside has started to move away from oil and gas drilling to renewable energy and resources projects after the Australian Government announced the incentive for companies who promote renewable resources spending. \n\nIn conclusion, I reiterate my statement above and disagree that increasing oil prices is the best solution to solve environmental issues.

By increase the cost of fuel for cars and vehicles itâs not better way to deal with the environmental issues, cost of fuel rises will affect the mankind in different ways. Fuel is the basic necessity to run automobiles, as cost rises of fuel it effects directly basic needs like food, transportation. Environmental issues cannot be resolved by increasing price of fuel for automobiles as I disagree with this statement, in my point of view to use electric cars as it take less amount of fuel for running process as these electric cars once charged so it runs many kilometers easily without again consumption of fuel requires. The disadvantages of increasing fuel cost to save environment, as inflation increases because everything transports to shops and superstores from warehouse so cost of products will increase. Another disadvantage, people travel through different automobiles to offices as increase of fuel cost will effect the income of employees it get tough for them to bare expenses of their daily life. However, in other words reasons for not increasing cost of fuel firstly as it effects the economy of country as inflation arises people spend less amount to buy products for their daily usage like grocery and other basic needs.

From my point of view, it is accurate to admit that this idea is absolutely unreasonable.

To be honest, we put ourselves in issues in order to know what is the benefit of consuming resources, mainly about petrol.\n\nHowever, in another opinion, we have a great impact to be aware of fuel price, which means we should take the cost in a suitable value. Peopleâs efforts in replacing the consumption of normal travelling equipment with bicycles or environmentally friendly ones need to be concentrated on. With this solution,  pollution can be dealt with. On the other hand, the request from  daily living has changed peopleâs minds about using fewer cars or motorbikes, except in several special situations. The truth is, we had better change to comfort the world, to understand what is the real value of using energy, since the outstanding transformation of technology.\n\nIn conclusion, what we have nowadays is a variety of resources to decide our future, also the responsibility for the potential dangers when they immediately come across. For that. we need to take over our best work so that the issues can be removed clearly.",

    "essay": "It is suggested by experts that the cost of fuels and all vehicles should be increased in response to the increasing severity of environmental problems. As far as I am concerned, I tend to believe this method definitely can benefit the whole society while potential negative influences bring about by this can not be ignored. \n\nOn the one hand, it is obvious that increasing the cost of fuel and all vehicles can resolve the issue of environmental preservation to some extent. Firstly, with the increasing price of fuel, working people who usually drive private cars to commute between workplaces and home will be more likely to take public transport alternately. Therefore, the exhaust gas released by private cars will be reduced, which somehow is a way to respond to air pollution issue. Secondly, the adjustment of car prices will potentially influence individuals' determination on purchasing a car. If they figure out the price of owning a car and additional expense is much more expensive than taking public transport, they would more likely to choose public transport such as trams, and buses, in order to avoid additional expenditure. And as a result, fewer cars running on roads means less exhaust air release.\n\nOn the other hand, the disadvantages of increasing fuel costs and vehicles price cannot be ignored. The main reason for this view is that this kind of method will potentially lead people who regarded private cars as a must to experience financial burden, especially for those working individuals who live far away from workplaces and earn low income, as their disposable income is limited. Another reason for this view is that it is a fact that people who owned cars already will still choose to commute by car if the adjusted fuel price is still affordable. As they have already gotten used to commuting by car and insist on it, and as a result, it does not make any difference to this group of people\n\nTo sum up, I tend to believe this method is a feasible solution in response to air pollution. However,  some people will disadvantage from it and other appropriate methods such as subsidising people to take public transport and hybrid cars users would probably be an alternative in responding to this topic.",

    "essay": "It is widely believed that nobody can deny that one solution to environmental problems would be for the government to raise the price of petrol. To a certain extent, I agree that this measure would be effective. However, I also believe that other measures might have an even better impact.\n\nIf states raised taxes on petrol, this would deal with two environmental concerns. First of all, regarding private vehicles, drivers would limit the number and length of their journeys due to hesitation in paying increasing expense. Simultaneously, national authorities would introduce the upgrading and expansion of public transportation, so that people could conveniently travel to work, to school or to travel to shops and hospitals, for instance. Moreover, from the freight services perspective, goods and products would have to be distributed from one place to another by rail rather than by truck. Both these mentioned methods contribute to cut down emissions from vehicle and hence help to reduce the greenhouse gases. \n\nOn the contrary, despite the fact that the rise in fuel cost might be an effective stopgap measure, governments could introduce and adopt transport policies or regulations which could be more efficient in long-term period. Take local authorities in London as an example. They introduced a congestion charge on all big vehicles visiting the city centre. The money raised from this policy are used to subsidize the cost of fares and to enhance transport infrastructure. This, in turn has remarkably decreased exhaust fumes, and as a result improved the air quality in the city. Furthermore, introducing and encouraging the use of electric vehicles which could greatly reduce the pollution level, and help to combat global warming. \n\nIn conclusion, increasing petrol cost would be a useful environmental-friendly transport measure, although in long term other methods would have more influence.",

    "essay": "The past 50 years have seen a dramatic increase in the occurrence of environmental problems. Some individuals claim that this issue could be solved by raising the cost of fuel. While I partly agree with this statement, I do believe that there are many other ways to deal with this issue, instead of looking at only one aspect of the problem.\n\nTo begin with, it is an indisputable fact that after the industrial revolution, the number of car factories  increased. As a result, nowadays, the air is adversely affected by  car exhaust gases which cause a harsh climate. To explain, these gases contain a huge amount of toxic substances, chief among them is Co2. To illustrate, Tehran- the capital of Iran- is a salient example of a polluted city. I suggest that by raising the pay for gasoline and petroleum, presumably, people tend to use less their private cars. Nonetheless, reaching this aim needs pivotal infrasturactions like a good public transportation system as well as implementation such cultivation as car/bike-sharing schemes.\n\nEqually importantly, the Earth suffer from some other problems more than just weather issues. Firstly, in recent days, more and more pollutants are discharged into the oceans. Thus, the lives of marine animals have become under threat of extinction. A salient instant is mass-stranding  in whales. Secondly, another major contributing factor is nature challenges. To explain, it might have been seen that more woodlands are recently destroyed by builders to build more houses and villas.\n\nBy way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that whereas increasing the expense of fuel can be beneficial for the sake of air pollution,  there are a number of other problems which are pivotal as much as air contamination.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, it is perceived that the effective way to remedy issues relating to the environment is to increase the pump price of gas for vehicles generally. Although some people believe that this move would resolve the environmental crisis, however, I vehemently disagree with that statement. This essay will elaborate that petroleum products such as fuel is not the major cause of climate disasters and increasing the cost price will not yield their intended purpose.\n\nTo start with, research has shown that harvesting  trees without replacing them, mining and poor waste management  are the major causes of environmental problems. Besides, if we fail to address  \n\nthe aforementioned  causes and concentrate on fuel alone, I am afraid that the situation will be worse in the future. For instance, the government should legislate a law that prohibits the cutting of trees, wrongful disposal of waste and regulate mining companies. Despite the fact that increasing the prices of gas would to some extent aid in protecting the environment, nonetheless, it will not have tremendous a benefit as one may think. \n\nMoreover, even though an uptrend in the prices of gas to some extent will curb about 10% of environmental problems, that in itself is not sufficient, as it will cause hardship on the people as most of them will resort to other activities such as coal mining which will be detrimental to the environment. To exemplify, in 2021, the authorities in Sierra Leone  increased the cost of fuel from 10,000 Leones to 20,000 Leones per litre in order to discourage vehicle owners from using their cars. Sadly, the transport fare for public transport shot up and the prices of groceries and other goods became a big challenge for its citizens. In addition, curbing fuel in isolation will not be beneficial to the climate. \n\nIn conclusion,  even though some people believe that increasing the cost of fuel for vehicles in my estimation, I totally disagree with that position.",

As far as I am concerned, there are two reasons that prove not only increasing the cost of fuel is affectless but also  can be damage for family financial.

There are many jobs that   require to use of personal transportation vehicles. When   the   cost of   fuel   is   increased  , people for the most probability  will be faced with financial difficulty.\n\n It can be further claimed that when people struggle against  poverty and they cannot provide daily needs so in this situation they never pay attention to the care of the environment . An example that will clarify the point is taxi drivers. The chief part of their job depends on cost of fuel so the high cost can be made it a hard condition for them.\n\nThe second substantial reason for the current discussion is the entertainment industry and tourism .In other words, a high percentage of travel is done with a personal vehicle. If people cannot purchase the fuel for their necessary needs perhaps they will   put    away unimportant expenses like travelling. For instance, there are many persons who  get  lower salaries than others like employees. They oblige to manage their income and spend most of their salary on essential requirements. So they will put travel in last preference. In this case, the tourism industry likely will experience high losses \n\nIn conclusion, there are various  solutions for solving the environmental crisis   But, it seems to me that enhancing the transportations cost like fuel is not logical and sensible. I  think improving the quality of public transport can be more effective to   solve   the environmental issue.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, global warming is the main topic worldwide, and many suggestions have been proposed to tackle this problem. Some environmentalists suggest that governments should impose taxes on fossil fuels to minimize their consumption,however, others consider this step is not achievable as there are no alternatives for fossil fuel in the meantime. In my perspective, the authorities should impose these tariffs and allocate these resources to overcome the emerging environmental issues.  \n\n  As a starting point, undoubtedly, the situation on our planet is worrying as many specialists urge governments to act expeditiously to contain this problem. Firstly, they call for decreasing our carbon fingerprints which means that humans should release less carbon because this is the root cause of global warming. Not only we will save our planet if we minimize the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere but also our air will be clean and refreshing. One way for achieving this goal is by increasing fossil fuel costs for the customers which will make many consumers reconsider other cheaper options. Although, this move requires thinking about other clean resources and how to make them practical for the customers.\n\n   In addition to imposing a tax on fossil fuels products, we have to provide other sources like renewable energies and how we harness them to provide energy for our vehicles. Admittedly, electric cars seem to be the best proper solution as they are reliable but the main drawback is the electric cars are much expensive. So the authorities have to subsidize these electric vehicles to make them affordable for the public. Additionally, we have to provide all the facilities for these cars like electric plug chargers in the main roads which we make many individuals turn towards these clean cars.\n\nTo conclude, no doubt that, our planet is facing a lot of challenges that require severe measures to handle . As the temperature of our globe goes up, it causes  serious repercussions for humanity. Hence, increasing fossil fuels price would deter us from the over-consumption of this harmful source of energy. At the same time, it will make us look at other sources of energy like electricity, wind and solar panels.",

It is believed by some that rise in fossil fuel price can reduce usages of cars and other conveyances which will impact environment positively. There are both merits and demerits of this trend and this essay will explain that an increase of fuel cost is not a proper way to reduce ecological problems.\n\nAt present crude oil is the main source of fuel. Therefore, increase of oil cost can even worsen the current situation because it is the only reliable gas source. In addition, no matter how expensive the oil customers will try to purchase it, unless any alternative is provided by the government. For example, hike in taxation for tobacco goods did not reduce its sales and the same will happen with petroleum as well.\n\nOn the other hand, authority should impose strict law and introduce more public transports, so that general people prefer to use communal transportations instead of using private cars. Secondly, Scientists should focus on development of alternative energy which can be available in market is less price that will not impact the surroundings widely. For instance, Tesla invented electric cars that can perform with electric power source, which is renewable and results zero carbon emission. Hence step by step we can eliminate the greenhouse gas release. The outcome will be clean and green atmosphere.\n\nIn conclusion, all above data shows that only increasing the fuel price will not reduce global warming effects.

Some people think that increasing the price of fuel used in four-wheelers and other means of transit may be the most effective way to combat the growing pollution. I agree with this but still, I think there are other ways to deal with the rising pollution.\n\nTo begin with, the increase in fuel prices will certainly have an impact on the usage of automobile and other means of transportation. The purpose of means of transportation, such as cars, has become common for us, as harmful gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen are eroding in this pure habitat, a gift from nature. Increasing the price of oil used in them will definitely reduce it to some extent. Furthermore, it will also benefit the authority exchequers that will apparently  benefit  the development of the poor people and organisations.\n\nIn addition, if the ministry cooperates in increasing the handling of other energy sources such as solar and wind efficiency, the issue of a polluted climate can be overcome. The authority should motivate the people to make maximum usage of this kind of power. In addition, the ministry should invest more in its regime coffers to build an automobile that runs on natural spirit. As a result, the handling of these modes of transportation will increase automatically.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that raising the prices of fuel and oil products, which are used in the operation of wagons, may work to some extent, but in addition, the regime should pay attention to the usage of natural efficiency consequently, our surroundings will be less polluted and human beings will be able to live their life in a better way.",

The auto industry is the single greatest engine of economic growth in the world.  In a country like India, the government depends on the automobile industry for its economic growth, thus leading poor regulations around auto ownership which has led to environmental destructions. The administration should enforce stringent laws so that people don't feel the urge of owning a car like for eg: increasing the cost of fuel which will restrict middle-class citizens to think through their decisions. Additionally, other measure can be that the taxes on autmobiles is increased. This will lead to individuals turning towards using public transport.\n\nIn conclusion, shared rides are an efificient method of communiting from one place to another, thus resulting in less cars which in return causes less traffic and saves the environment",

I strongly agree that it can decrease the level of exhaust fumes from the vehicles because people start to look for alternative cheaper energy. Hence, electro cars could be very popular and might be less cost, therefore, they emit less harmful pollutants in the air. For example, there are some places in Japan, where most of people use electro mobiles and the level of air polution is lower than in the other cities.  Also, if the fuel price is up, people can use an alternative sources of energy. For instance, solar power and wind energy can be commonly used because they are much cheaper. \n\nBut on the other hand, I definitely disagree that this can solve all environmental problems. There are a lot of other human activities which influence on nature. For example, there are a lot of places in the world where individuals pollute their cities by disposing the garbage on the streets and fields, accorgingly, the toxic rubbish destroys the ecosystem and contaminates the soil. \n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that nowadays mankind can face the global disaster.

In my own perspective, I disagree with this notion of the rise in the petrol or diesel cost.\n\nOn the one hand, there is no significant improvement seen in the air quality index from the past strategy of hiking the petrol prices. In fact, raising its costs will put the financial burden on the community, and along with that, it will also increase the price of other essential commodities such as transportation, and food items. Thus, it makes the life of especially poor and middle income families more difficult. However, the other expenditure can be increased in the form of insurance policy, service and maintenance charges, and paid parking spots to limit the number of cars on the highways and roads.\n\nOn the other hand, the government should launch some reforms to decrease the emission of carbon footprints and air pollution levels. For instance, the use of the renewable energy resources such as solar, wind and tide should be promoted instead of non renewable products such as coal and petrol. Additionally, the public transportation through trains and buses should be made highly accessible with the frequent timings, issuing the cheaper monthly passes, and the economical ticket prices.

From my perspective, increasing in petrol price may be reasonable to some extent; however, this solution remains several drawbacks.\n\nOn the one hand, setting a higher cost for fuel will be beneficial in some aspects of alleviating severe pollution problems nowadays. Firstly, the rate of air pollution will improve significantly as the amount of carbon emission decreases. Since people are restricted to traveling by vehicles, they would commute on foot or by bicycles more often, which, in turn, reduces a considerable amount of carbon footprint released per day.

As less fuel is consumed, the frequency of exploitation of natural resources will gradually lessen over time, allowing them to renew faster. \n\nOn the other hand, there will doubtlessly occurs some problems when establishing fuel price escalation. It is evident that the decline in petrol consumption will result in a loss of profit for petroleum industry. As the number of fuel consumers decreases, it will be a daunting task for companies to maintain due to the lack of operating expenditure; some may even undergo bankruptcy.

If the value of fuels reduces out of realization and not inflation?

This is because the excessive use of the vehicle produces the most amount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere which is detrimental to the environment. If the price of oil is increased, individual people will stop using their cars to reduce the cost. However, the rise in fuel cost always determines the market prices of all related to goods that are hit most to the middle class and poor families. I believe that the increase in the cost of fuel will not stop environmental pollution.\n\nOn the other hand, governments can take other measures to deal with the problem. firstly, governments can increase funding to find an alternative source of energy such as solar panels, wind energy. To illustrate this the CEO of Tesla,  Solar Energy  Elan Mask said, that if the government funds his project of solar panels, he will completely able to remove the dependency of non-renewable resources like coal and petrol. And also solar power in the USA has proven its efficiency in energy production. Secondly, the government can encourage more people to switch to electric cars so this environment can be protected.\n\nInconclusion, I believe that to increase the cost of fuel is not an appropriate way to solve the environmental problem. Renewable energy sources are better alternatives to deal with this issue and also motivate people to use an electric car.",

    "essay": "The tremendous usage of fuel is the major cause of global warming. How can we save our Mother Earth? While few believe hiking the prices of fuel curbs the global environment issues, I disagree to the assertion that increasing the oil fares would make any impact.\nThere are few compelling reasons why I think the spike in fuel prices would make any change in global environment issues. Firstly, people are very much accustomed to the luxury life that they choose comfort and refrain from usage of any public transport. As per the recent report published in Times Now, there is a 60% increase on traffic from the last 5 years. Secondly, the fuel fares have already gone beyond the threshold limit, even though people still use their private vehicle as it seems to be the easy mode of commute. Finally, the quality and maintenance of public transport is so devastating that it is making the life of travelerâs miserable, which in turn is forcing the passengers to opt their private transport. \nHowever, to solve the climate change issues, there are various other methods which could be taken into consideration. The government should come up with subsidies for the usage of public transport, which would attract more passengers because of which the traffic deteriorates. Besides, the officials should pass strict rules that a family should not own more than one car so that the number of vehicle purchase goes down, which contributes to the nature. Nevertheless, the forests which are being uprooted to construct the industries and factories should be controlled, which reduces the deforestation issues as well as the poisonous gases getting released from them could be brought down. Subsequently, it could bring a substantial change in the Earthâs nature.\nIn conclusion, I disagree to the assertion that there are various other factor to fight the global environment issues and hiking the fuel prices would not suffice this serious problem.",

    "essay": "Automobiles and other vehicles are essential part of transportation for majority of the people residing here in Pakistan. Most people think that the prices of the fuel should be raised by the government to solve the problems,related to the environment, persisting in our country . This essay will discuss that how i disagree, moderately, with the given statement.\n\nFirst of all uses of the vehicles should be asscessed . Currently according to the statistics, 80% of the population own their own asset be it a car or a bike. The best advantage of owning a vehicle is that it is cheaper than renting a car or looking for some other alternative like taking service from Uber or Careem. So all of such things run on the fuel which in short becomes the basic necessity of every house hold.\nAlthough usage of the fuel does cause damage to the environment but in my opinion the government should look in to the other important factors which are causing bigger problems to our environment. Problems created by the usage of fuel in the cars and other vehicles are very less as compared to the other factors which are contributing to ruin the air.  For example the refErigeators and the aerosol sprays that we use daily emits chloroflourocarbons (CFCs). The relese of this harmful chemical evolves in the air and effects our ozone layer , the layer which protects the planet earth from the damaging ultravoilet radiations ,which is depleting over the passage of time. The prices of such things should be raised because they are causing more damage to the environment.\nIt is concluded that the prices of the fuel should not be raised for the common means of commute , like cars and motor bikes etc ,as it is, nowadays , necessity for the layman and  instead the government should take appropriate measures to eradicate other problems which are much more harmful to our envoirnment.",

    "essay": "In recent times, there have been increased awareness of environmental challenges in many countries. It is often argued that a significant measure to address problems in the environment is to raise the price of oil and gas use by automobiles. I support this notion because it will help reduce both traffic congestion on the roads as well as air and noise pollution.\nFirstly, a rise in the price of fuel often result in a corresponding decline in traffic on the roads. High gasoline price makes it costlier to maintain cars. Thus, people would choose to use the public transportation system such as trains, ferries and metropolitan buses than personal vechicles. As a consequence, there will be less pressure on the roads, which will limit calls for road expansions that often destroy the ecosystem. If there were no rise in the cost of gasoline for example, there would have been increased agitations for new roads, due to traffic jams with its negative environmental impacts.\nSecondly, an important way to reduce noise and air pollution is to make fuel more expensive . This will reduce exhaust and noise because of the reduced volume of cars. Rather than buying expensive fuel, people will seek for sustainable means of transporting themselves. For instance, means such as electric cars and bicycles that produce little undesirable effects on the environment. As a result, there will be a reduction in the deleterious consequences of climate change.\nIn conclusion, when the cost of fuel for automobiles is increased, there will be reduction in road congestion and pollution, which will go a long way in solving environmental problems. This will ensure a suitable earth conditions for the future generation.",

    "essay": "Environmental problems like pollution in this world is taking new upper limit and getting worsen day by day. Some individuals believe that the most effective way to deal with worldwide ecological difficulties is to raise the price of fuel. However, I am of the opinion that it will benefit the society to some extent only, which will be discussed in the following paragraphs.\nIncrease in price of fuel will limit the personal transport of an individual to some levels and commuters will find other alternatives to travel on daily basic such as public transport or electric vehicles. Majorly the middle class families will be effected with this step and persuade them to follow local city transport in the sake of controlling pollution. Recently, in Delhi, the government took initiatives to control the personal vehicle on road by charging double amount on petrol purchase for own carriers, thus the output was quite effective and number of vehicles drop down approximately 80 percent from the service roads. \nHowever, on the other hand, the major contributors of air pollution are the airplanes. In that case lowering the price will not impact much as air travelling is carried by mostly rich people and it is part of luxury. People who prefer travelling by air as compare to road are always keeping the time limit as priority instead of money. Hence, increasing price will not lower the usage of air transport. Thus, we need to look for an alternative solution to minimize the pollution hazard. \nIn conclusion, increasing price of fuel will profit the community in terms of limiting usage of personal conveyance, but for some who choose time as the limit instead of money will not be effected with this idea. Consequently, I believe inflation in price will not resolve the ecological problems.",

However, this may help with the reduction of pollutants in the world, still it is not a significant idea to solve the environmental problems. Government should start some more effective plans, such as using biofuels and ban some vehicles. Therefore, I disagree on the former statement.\n\nTo commence with, instead of rising the rate of vehicles, adminsitration should start some policies and programmes that will help in the betterment of environment. Government should implement the law for using biofuels instead of normal fuel that release numerous kinds of pollutant in the air. For instance: there are several nations who are working for the developmemt of biofuels and recently the company in India has released the car which run on biofuels, that is 70% ethanol, which help in solving pollution.\n\nIn additon to this, another answer for environmental pollution can be, the ban of certain vehicles. Transports which are more than 15 years old, should be ban by the government. Since, current studies have shown that cars, trucks, etc. which were bought 15 years ago, pollute the environment more than the recent vehicles. For example: in India, the number of states have banned these kind of transports and there is an environmental improvement.\n\nTo conclude, different perspective should be seen by government, instead of just increasing the cost of fuels and vehicles. The number of researchs has been made and this should be in consideration of citizens as well as the legislatures. Therefore, distinct views should be taken for pollution controlling.",

I completely disagree with this statement, because this is not a practical solution for all environmental issues.\n\nFew people think the usage of fuel is the main reason for all the environmental problems which may be because of some propaganda. Primarily, the inflated usage of private vehicles leads to the release of carbon monoxide into the air which leads to the greenhouse gas effect as well as gradual global warming. Secondly, the utmost utilisation of natural resources to produce fuels is an irreversible one and it causes irreparable damage to the earth. For example; the amount of coal mines is decreasing exponentially.\n\nOn the other hand, the reasons for environmental problem are not only because of  fuel usage but also many others.

In addition, if the cost of the fuel increases, people will buy the fuel by giving that price.\n\nIn summary, some comment that environmental problems can be controlled by escalating the fuel cost of vehicles.

    "essay": "Raising the price of petrol for vehicles and other transportation modes is considered by some people as one of the best ways to solve the environmental problem. I believe there are positives and negatives to this approach which I will analyze in this essay.\n\nFirst of all, I agree that increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles is one of the best ways to solve the environmental problem, because nowadays there are too many cars running on the roads. Almost everyone has a car and do not like to use public transportation because it is difficult to go to work by bus or metro especially from the suburbs. However, if the government raises the price of petrol and make their public transportation systems more enticing, it will make citizens more likely to utilize it.\n\nThere are multiple methods that the government could implement to persuade people to make more use of public transport and stop using their own cars. For example, if people can get a discount for taking public transportation, they will be willing to do it from time to time. The government could also implement and build infrastructure and systems for people to ride their bicycles. If it is convenient for everyone to rent bikes from one place and return to another, it will become more popular for people to use it and will reduce the amount of time they spend driving their cars which will have a positive effect on the environment.\n\nOn the other hand, it is not only because of people driving cars and the resultant carbon dioxide emissions that the human-race is having a negative impact on the environment, there are a plethora of other factors which are also contributing to this impact. According to many studies, climate change is caused by many different factors which include(s) making (processing meat) products related to meat, manufacturing factories, agricultural fertilization to grow crops...etc. Therefore, all of these factors and different areas of human activity cause environmental problems which results in climate change.\n\nIn conclusion, though there are many issues which contribute to the environmental problem, I believe increasing the price of fuel will have an overall positive effect by encouraging people to utilize different modes of transport and consequently reduce the negative impact on the environment.",

    "essay": "Green issues have become increasingly popular among some demographics of our society. Some people strongly believe that one of the most efficient ways of resolving such problems would be a significant rise in fuel prices. This essay will discuss that such change could only be a partial resolution. The reasons supporting this opinion will be discussed below. \n\nTo start with, a lot of people consider that if we put up the price of petrol and gas for automobiles, we would end up with a much lower number of vehicles on the streets. This in its turn would lead to cutting the number of exhaust fumes, which admittedly are one of the main reasons for causing environmental dilemmas. Furthermore, in case of high gasoline prices, people not only drive less but will generally travel smart, try to stay closer to home for shopping, combining various errands to be more efficient. And this potentially would reduce an average carbon footprint and contribute to conserving nature. Thua these few instances have bolstered an opinion that upsurge of an upsurge in fuel costs would help to tackle the green issues. \n\nHowever, regardless of the benefits above, the idea that environmental challenges could be eradicated only if fuel prices are higher is not completely valid. The rationale behind it is that ecological concerns are caused not only by poisonous car emissions but also by a high number of other factors such as population expansion, pollution of land and water through excessive deforestation, industrialisation and overfilling landfills which emit CO2 and add to greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, reducing emissions through increasing prices and discouraging people from driving less, will only be an interim solution to the problem. Furthermore, an upsurge in fuel prices will affect transportation-focused industries like airlines and trucking, not only automobiles. Anything that must be shipped or transportedâfrom apples to electronicsâcould cost more as gas prices rise. This is especially true for products, or components for products, that are manufactured overseas. Overall, the idea that increased prices on fuel would resolve the green issues could potentially lead to a far worse outcome for society. \n\nTo conclude, this essay argued that increasing prices on fuel could be only a partial solution to environmental concerns and people who believe the opposite underestimate the real effects of what they believe. In my opinion, solving key issues is vital, however, we should not solely depend on one resolution and try to see more efficient and diverse ways of maintaining the environment clean.",

    "essay": "As the world is on the cutting edge of globalisation, environmental issues are increasing day by day. So the pollution to the ecosystem is varied in numerous. Accordingly, some of the population withhold that increasing the prices of fuel for automated cars and other vehicles will solve environmental problems, but according to my point of view, I completely agree with the above statement. The following essay will outline my points with examples. \n\nAir pollution is the significant problem around the globe  because many countries are suffering from the consequences of the issue. While it is evident that increasing the fuel prices will reduce  pollution, because few vehicles will be on the road and there will be less pollution. To exemplify, Singapore has increased the tax rates of new vehicles so that there will be fewer buyers and the air pollution throughout the country will slightly reduce. \n\nHowever, there are other methods to solve this problem as well. One of the methods is to increase the usage of public transport, make  people aware of  air pollution and its harmful effects on humans and reduce the fair prices of public transport vehicles, so that  people will use more of them, moreover as there are a limited amount of public vehicles like trams, trains and buses  if the government increase the transport method the pollution of biodiversity will be reduced in the upcoming years. As an example, London has a huge metro train system, which is quite affordable and people prefer to use public transport instead of personal vehicles. \n\nTo sum up, environmental pollution can be reduced by increasing the price of gasoline,subsequently there are other methods such as imposing taxes to brand new vehicles and using public vehicles that will combat the issue.",

In my opinion, I agree that the increase in the price of  fuel  reduced the environmental concern by reducing the number of vehicles on the street.  However, educating people on environmental safety also have a way of solving environmental problems. \n\n \n\nOne of the best methods to decrease environmental problem such as pollution is by inflating the price of  fuels . This is because this would reduce the percentage of cars in  society. Therefore, the level of exposure to pollutants would be reduced. For example, many studies have shown that vehicles consumed the highest proportion of fuels and they also release fumes that caused air pollution into the environment.  Thus,by inflating the costs of fuels the number of cars in the street would also decline which would eventually reduce pollution. \n\nAnother point to consider on how to solve environmental problems is by educating people on to keep the environment clean . In other words, this would serve as a basis for keeping the environment safe  because people would be aware of hazards related to the dirtiness of  society.  Also,people should  be educated on the importance of using  recycling materials rather than discarding them to the surrounding. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the high price of fuel would reduce environmental problems and educating people on the crucial environmental safety is,can go a long way in solving environmental issues.",

Thence, some people contemplate that increasing the fee of fuels such as coal, gas, petrol for cars and other vehicles is one of the best solution. In my opinion, it may be  the right way, however, this is not the only solution to tackle this problem. \n\nTo begin with, increasing the price of crude oil can help to some degree, but there is more disadvantage. In the other words, if the power raises the pay of gasoline unreasonably, the cost increase will cause more problems. For example, when the premium of fuel is increased unreasonably, other sectors that run gasoline face more  and more problems, and the prices rise sharply. As a result, poor and middle class families encounter many difficulties, and protest among the people will intensify against the power. Moreover, the increase in the cost of gasoline will not stop air pollution.\n\nOn the other hand, the state should be developed in renewable energy source such as, wind, solar and tide rather than non renewable resource like coal and kerosene. For example, today, many countries are using renewable resources. The law encourages people to use public transportation by improving public transportation and reducing the cost of travelling. As a result, emissions of harmful gases are reduced in the atmosphere, and  non renewable energy resources are saved.\n\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that the use in the renewable energy sources is one of the best solution to this problem.

Some people suggest that one of the optimal ways to solve these problems is by increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. While I agree that it would be helpful to a certain extent, but I strongly disagree that it might be the most appropriate way to protect and conserve the surroundings. The essay evaluates the reasons for disagreement.\n     Many people are of the opinion that price rise of fuel for vehicles would refrain majority of the population from using private transport, thereby reducing the poisonous emissions of carbon monoxide and harming the environment. It would encourage the purpose of public transport or bikes for that matter, since it is a cheaper option. However the above is a form of inflation, by which the rich would become richer and the poor would become poorer.\n     Instead of a price hike, wouldn't it be better if communities are educated? If the value of fuels reduces out of realization and not inflation? By enhancing the awareness in the society, people would utilise trains and bikes, moreover view the positives of using electric cars. If they are knowledgeable about the poisonous emissions of gases, which not only cause harm to human health in the form of respiratory diseases, but also to the nature due to  depletion of the ozone layer, the use of fuel-based vehicles, I believe would greatly reduce. This environmental awareness needs to be raised amongst small villages, as well as huge cities, whereby servicing of vehicles happens at regular intervals and the engines are repaired well to not release smoke.\n     Therefore I feel that a price raise would just be a temporary solution for the environmental issues caused by fuels.  On the other hand  the spread of knowledge and literacy would go miles in inculcating a sense of responsibility amongst the people. It would encourage the use of transportation that use minimum or no fuel at all, positively impacting the climate as well as the economy of the nation.",

    "essay": "Recently, the number of young people who offend the law is increasing in many big cities. There are many reasons that result in this phenomenon, varying from one country to another. Two main factors and appropriate solutions will be indicated further in the following part of this essay.\n\nTo begin with, a negative family environment and pressure from social and school life seem to be two main reasons for the rise of jubilant offenders. Firstly, toxic backgrounds can lead kids to  inappropriate actions that are socially unacceptable or morally wrong. For example, if parents are alcoholics or workaholics and, as a result, they will not spend enough time with their children, kids tend to commit crimes to draw their parentsâ attention. Secondly, due to enormous stress, teenagers commit a felony as a way to get some excitement or feel  control over their life. To illustrate this idea, many youths do vandalism or shoplift useless items just for fun. To sum up, the elevation of youth crimes tends to result from both domestic and social impacts.\n\nTo reduce  juvenile delinquency, it is necessary to focus on young peopleâs lives both at home and at school. On the one hand, parents should be considerate by paying more attention to what kids are doing and how they feel. On the other hand, youngsters should be encouraged to learn what they are good at so they can be more confident about their futures. In conclusion, both parents and education staff play an important role to solve the rising number of young law-breakers.\n\nTo abridge, the rise of youth crimes can be linked to factors at home and at school. Nevertheless, there are some ways to deal with the apparent problem by focusing on its roots which is why people decided to break the law.",

    "essay": "The following essay claims that parents should encourage their children to do more sports instead of forcing them to spend all their time studying. And I partially agree with this statement. Although, I concur with the idea that education is quite important, too. That's why I concur with the idea that children should spend time doing both of these activities. \n\nFirst and foremost, I want to mention that education is quite important for the child's future. Good education does not only affect child's future, but also helps them to make their outlook wider. And this ability will be important in their adulthood And they would be able to have their opinion and express it. Because in my opinion, education does not consist only of different kinds of school subjects, it also includes finance, the ability of public speaking and expressing one's mind. \n\nBut I also agree with the idea that sport is also compulsory for the development of a child. Firstly, regularly doing sport helps a person to be much healthier and makes a person much stronger. Also, it was scientifically proven that doing sport makes your brain work better and age less faster. I think that it is quite important for everyone. \n\nTo sum up, I concur with the idea that the child should not only study, but also do sport. By combining both of these activities a child would be able healthy, smart and sociable. Also, I would like to mention that habits that are built in person's childhood stick to that person until the end of their life. That's why during that period of time you need to build as much healthy habits as possible.",

    "essay": "Children's priorities have always been under parents' concerns. A coterie of the masses believe that the youth ought to be urged to attend physically extra curriculums; meanwhile, others think having kids trained academically is more beneficial for future careers. From my perspective, I acquiesce in having students grind in their subjects and focus more on their studies.\n\nIt is undeniable that academic concentration has numerous potentials. Firstly, students who take academic knowledge as their profession will have more opportunities in being applied for a high-paid occupation. For instance, graduates with a degree in computer science are more likely to be recruited for higher positioning vacancies than a person who is excelled at playing soccer. In addition, mind-working jobs are less likely to be affected by unprecedented incidents. Evidently, sports championships are perpetually postponed  due to the uncontrolled spread of covid 19; however, intellectual employees can flexibly work at their own accommodations and interact with each other via the mass media. Eventually, encouraging kids to follow the road of academics will ensure the prosperity of their futures.\n\nOn the other hand, that children are exhorted to do sports activities has a lot of limitations. Young students with lower physical status will be debilitated being urged to do sports. Thus, there being extremely fatigued will inhibit their leisure activities and  performances at school.  for example, offspring with chronic asthma will perform worse than normal students if their parents oblige them to spend time doing outdoor sports. Moreover, sports activities will cause a lack of time spent on academic studies. Therefore, kids  who have more limited abilities to study will worsen their marks at school by not spending a decent amount of time focusing on their drawbacks. Needless to say, urging the youth to play physical activities makes them distracted from their paramount purposes as students. \n\nIn conclusion, the potentials that academic focus brings will be much more effective and efficient for kids' future lives. parents should create a consummate schedule to balance the time spent on studying and the interval for sports activities.",

Therefore, parents should try to balance the amount of time children spend for both these types of activities. \nOn the one hand, it is important for a children to be well-educated. Spend time studying can help children to train their ability in logical thinking and hard-working. These skills not only shown it value to increase the productivity of the students at school, but also very benefitial for their life after graduation. It can be argued that these skills provide more jobs opportunities, career progression, better salaries, and therefore improve the quality of life for students who have them. Moreover, it is also crucial to ensure our next human generation have enough knowledge to continue the humanityâs development. They are the future world leaders, so giving them a better education can result in the latter new inventions, economic growth or greater future prosperity.\nOn the other hand, physical workouts also play an important role in the life of a child. Doing regular body exercises is believe to be benefitial for the childrenâs health, especially for the immune system, thus help to reduce the risk of children suffer from many kind of diseases such as obesity or near-sighted.

Some people think that leave from the job should be given to men who are going to have a baby. Let us discuss this statement before concluding with an opinion for a better understanding.\n\nTo begin with, Baby is a part of both woman and man lives. Employers give paternity leave only to wives who are going to give birth to a child which is unfair for husbands. Fathers also desire to spend a lot of time with their new baby. For example, playing with them knowing their small habits and so on. These are very interesting as well as happy moments for them to remind one day. Thus, Time off for fathers should be entitled for their happy life with a new baby born.\n\nFurthermore, Helping wives at the moment of their pregnancy period  is another reason to give time off from work to their husbands. At that time, it is very difficult for women to do household chores. If their partner have leave from work, they could take care of their wives. Despite all these, Employers also get benefit from giving time off to their male workers. To be clear, At the delivery time, fathers are very stress and unconscious. They are unable to concentrate on their work as a result the employer can loose profitably.\n\nTo conclude, After having a big discussion, I am in the favour that fathers should be entitled for paternity leave.

    "essay": "In the modern world, the government should probably face many overseas issues such as crimes, environmental problems, and so on which might require much financial assistance. Some residents argued that the council needs to use its funds to address the human life standard such as the homeless and jobless more than the international ones, while I firmly expose that measures, which are related to global ones should be prioritized over the domestic ones. It helps residents have more job opportunities as well as global problem-solving.\n\nOn the one hand, it doubtlessly hopes that the locally living standard such as jobs and accommodation should be a crucial focus. It is beneficial to reduce the poverty as well as local crimes. To illustrate, the country leaders in some areas burned a big amount of money to allocate the economy in order to bring the residentâs well-being both physical and mental by being in terms of the social construction which relies on the advancement of the economy.

This will address directly the demands of jobs which resulting personal finance to have accommodation. Furthermore, international aid needs the local councilsâ responsibility which aimed personal awareness about what they are facing such as air emissions, deforestation, natural disasters, and so on.

This transformation delivers some problems in humans, such as poverty, starving, lack of health facilities, and unemployment. As a result, I personally believe that every polity must prioritize its country before spending money on international aid. \n\nThere are some reasons why every nation must accentuate its country before help foreigner. Firstly, every nation has limited budget to solve such problems in its homeland. From this budget, all of the states also must have reserve funds to overcome some calamities, whether they are incidentals or not. China, the new emerging one, has giant allocation and can invest it to expertise all of the citizens. Secondly, governments be accused to have attention to help their citizens for better occupation. Moreover, governments must allocate some money to train their people and give some of their facilities. \n\nOn the other hand, it is understandable and reasonable to donate some fund to poorer nations as a gesture of decency and humanity. No country, can live in prosperity while others, especially neighbourhood, which live below the poverty line. By offering other states, some financial assistance, the official also can elude illegal immigrant. For instance, some of the Mexicans go to the United States because they are difficult to survive. Even so, I think the instruments must prioritize their public.

However, I strongly iterate that the government must improve the economic, financial and employment prospects of its own people before embarking on humanitarian work abroad",

    "essay": "The opinion is divided as to whether it is the role of the authorities or individuals to look after themselves at old age. While some persons argue that government have to cater for the needs of its citizens, others believe that the public should plan their retirement. This essay will discuss both views in detail followed by a reasoned conclusion. \n\nOne of the reasons why people demand support from those in power at old age can be seen as a fundamental human right. Therefore every leader in every society has the duty to provide aid for the aged and dependent. For example, the military and civil servants gave their all during years of active service to the good of the country and it is morally justified for politicians to reciprocate by aiding the elderly. To further illustrate, some old people have challenging ailments which can only be overcome through free health care services by the government. For instance, via National Health Insurance Scheme, Nigerians are now able to seek quality health care which has improved the average life expectancy in the last decade.\n\nEven though authorities are playing a key role, individuals need to support themselves too. Firstly, being able to save for the future reduces the national burden . This is because more money is then diverted to other lacking sectors of the economy including good roads and electricity. For example, a recent study has shown that the amount incurred by African countries in delivering free medical backing to their citizens is over 30% of the national budget leading to scarcity of funds in other sectors. Hence  gross underdeveloped was achieved. Lastly, it is important for humans to save in other to support their children too. Thus helping in the long run at securing a bright future for them as they are able to afford decent school and training thereby impacting  society positively.\n\nIn conclusion, although controversy still exists on whether the government or public should cater for their old age ,however I am of the opinion that both have a concerted effort at achieving optimal care after retirement.",

    "essay": "A portion of communities argue that the most important thing kids should learn from education institutes is how to become fine residents and workers. However , others think that it has more advantages for the  person. I partially agree with the statement, because I believe two of them are complimentary. \n\nFirstly, School is a place where children cultivate good habits. Such as manner,and sense of time. Furthermore, kids also learn cooperation and communication in school. The abilities above are the basis of being a good resident and efficient employee, however, they can also advantage individuals in their career lives. For instance, a worker who has a better attitude and always finishes the task on time is more likely to be promoted than others who donât. Also, teamwork allows individuals to bring their diverse perspectives to problem-solving, which in turn increases their success at arriving at solutions more efficiently and effectively. As a result, we can see that while being a good citizen and worker, the resident can also get benefits.  \n\nMoreover, a study from the National Taiwan University shows that the education level is disproportionate to the crime rate.Furthermore, as  time changes, finding an individual's interest is becoming more and more important in education.The youth no longer be taught that getting good scores is the only way the be successful in their future life. The educators started to help children search for their passion, instead of telling them what to do is the best. For instance, Taiwanâs high school students not only take normal classes like math, Chinese, and science, but the clubs after school are taken seriously nowadays. \n\nIn conclusion, formal school help students lay a foundation for becoming a good person in the world, meanwhile, it plays an important role in guiding children to find their own passion.",

    "essay": "There is a social expectation that all teenagers should be forced to do unpaid work to improve the local community, which can enhance the well-being of both individuals and society. Personally, I do think participating in voluntary work in the local community should be justified because of several reasons. \n\nIt is undeniable that unpaid work can provide young people with a valuable opportunity to cultivate their skills. In fact, to achieve daily tasks involved in community work, teenagers need to communicate with plenty of clients who have diverse backgrounds and character traits, adjust their negative emotions brought about by stressful situations, and reflect on what they can do to improve their services. These activities all require comprehensive skills such as critical thinking, resilience, self-care, and empathy. Therefore, it could be a predictable outcome that teenagers who regularly train themselves through these activities are more likely to be competent compared to their peers. In this sense, the advantages of community work outweigh the drawbacks. \n\nAs for society, unpaid community work may contribute to the declining rates of juvenile delinquency and therefore more stable social order. I reckon the reason why  youth crimes are still existing in our society is the lack of citizenship education among teenagers. However, voluntary community work would be an efficient pedagogical tool to gradually educate teenagers on the sense of social responsibility. This means that the more teenagers engage in volunteering work, the more likely they are  to commit offences or threaten  public safety. Consequently, social stability can be improved due to community work. \n\nIn conclusion, I strongly support the proposal that requires teenagers to participate in unpaid community work. Not only can they acquire various skills from daily practices, but also can  prevent the youth from committing crimes.",

However, I do not agree that we should therefore force all teenagers to do unpaid work.

School is just as demanding as a full-time job, and teachers expect their students to do homework and exam revision on top of attending lessons every day. When young people do have some free time, we should encourage them to enjoy it with their friends or to spend it doing sports and other leisure activities. They have many years of work ahead of them when they finish their studies. At the same time, I do not believe that society has anything to gain from obliging young people to do unpaid work. In fact, I would argue that it goes against the values of a free and fair society to force a group of people to do something against their will. Doing this can only lead to resentment amongst young people, who would feel that they were being used, and parents, who would not want to be told how to raise their children.

    "essay": "Nowadays, many people believe that children in the thirteen to nineteen age group should be forced to take part in  volunteer work which can create many valuable contributions to their local community. Personally speaking, I totally agree with this statement and the essay below aims to clarify my point of view.\n\nOne of the cogent reasons why I agree with this opinion is that doing unpaid work can help children to improve their ability to deal with problems in different situations and develop their advanced skills. Firstly, if students always study theory without practising what they learnt, their flexibility in solving problems will be greatly reduced. When you are learning, everything you know is just theoretical and you can not predict what accident is going to happen in the future like when you go to work. Working at an early age will help you to come into contact with reality and be capable of dealing with unexpected incidents from your experience. For example, if you want to become a teacher, you can choose to teach children in churches or orphanages. This work can help you to understand children's psychology more, thereby easily imparting knowledge to them.\n\nMoreover, by applying in practice the knowledge which is taught at school through some unpaid jobs, teenagers can recognise their weaknesses and strengths early. From that, they will be able to give themselves some precise orientations about what they can do and focus on developing their own skills.  Apart from enhancing the students' skills, encouraging young people to help the local residents without getting salaries also creates a responsible society. When doing unpaid jobs becomes a duty for teenagers, all kids will have to do it due to its subjection which is essential for their homeland. And in case they do not perform this obligation, they can suffer some deterrence from older people.\n\nIn conclusion, although there are some demerits such as wasting important time, I think the benefits of the idea of forcing children to become volunteers is necessary for both individuals and their community due to its huge merits.",

    "essay": "People agree if adolescents may do some volunteering activities in their free time, those will give them some opportunities for them like looking forward to jobs, creating networking, helping each other, and many more. Besides \n\nteenagers, these activities can help communities for search volunteers too.\n\nAdolescents will have more free time than any age group so they have opportunities for exploring something new. Some volunteering activities like charities, helping old people in their homes, do some school activities may improve their skills for humanism. Then, being involved in activities such as volunteering may help them for using their free time. On the other hand, when teenagers do something in this work, it can create a good relationship between people who are embroiled in this work. Finally, young people will get a chance for searching jobs. \n\nFor the community itself, it may help for arranging the budget when the activity is held. For example, the budget for paying people who take action in this activity can be reduced. Then, the Community should not worry about people who will help or be involved in the activity. The group should only focus to the main goal that can help or give the benefit to each other.\n\nIn conclusion, this relationship can give  benefit   society,  teenagers and the community itself. Not only for them, but also for someone who really needs their help like old people, disabled people, and so on. Young people usually have great power and competent skills for helping in this projects. So this society really improves humanism aspects in this world.",

    "essay": "These days, many teenagers dedicate themselves in volunteers in community work. Some assert that this development brings benefits to both children and the community. In my point of view, I strongly agree with this belief for two key reasons. Firstly, they can build a wide range of skills and knowledge bases, which are essential for their future lives, and secondly, the community can provide more services to many people who want them.\n\nThe primary reason I agree is that engaging in community activities plays a crucial role in order to develop teenagers' vital skill sets including problem-solving skills. For instance, since there are difficulties occurring in community work which force them to think deeply and logically to solve issues, this environment would help to accelerate their cognitive function resulting in the improvement in the above-mentioned skill. In fact, recent research conducted by The University of Tokyo revealed that children are more likely to gain favourable skills in such situations than staying at school. Therefore, it is clear that community work is favourable for them.\n\nFurther support for my idea is that the community can provide their services for more individuals who are eager for them. This is because they basically struggle with a lack of labour force and teenagers would compensate for this situation. According to an article in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, employers in communities in Japan, especially organizations with financial problems, mentioned that student volunteer staff noticeably contributed to their activities, which meant more individuals could rely on the service. Thus, there is another merit to requiring teenagers to do unpaid community work. \n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that there are many advantages which come from the situation that young people work for the community as volunteers. In particular, they can gain helpful skills for their future lives and community organizers can spread their services to more people.",

I strongly support that view of people because doing social tasks will not only help teenagers and chance to explore skills but also provides helping hands to people.\n\nBeing engaged in social work gives mental and physical satisfaction to juveniles. In their busy lifestyle, they donât have time for extra curriculum activities  and get more depressed. But working on community task give a chance to them to divert their energy in a good way which helps in reducing their depression. For example :- a study carried out by a university in the United States in which get results that adolescents who serve in the community for 10 hours are less likely to feel depressed as compared to those who do not  volunteer.\n\nAdditionally, doing volunteer work with youngsters gives aid to society for a better living environment. Many organizations efforts to the improvements of structure and environmental conditions of society which leads people to obtain a superior quality of living style. To illustrate :-India a campaign was started by the Indian Prime Minister with unpaid workers in which they sweep roads and planted herbaceous trees on the sides of roads to overcome air pollution which ultimately benefits the local crowd.\n\nIn conclusion, I think, volunteer job is two-sided benefits, so stepping forward for the public effort by juveniles to utilize their energy in a positive direction and individuals get welfare in society.",

    "essay": "These days many youngsters are contributing to society by doing help of people freely. A number of individuals have thought that every youth should participate in doing a job voluntarily in their spare time to support the local people of society. According to them doing such tasks will be beneficial for everyone who belongs to the community and each juvenile as well. I agree with the given statement which I shall explain in upcoming paragraphs.\n\nTo commence with the view of the agreement , doing a job voluntarily helps in building the personality and character of young persons. To explain it, when juveniles come forward to contribute their help and time to society for the betterment, they learn a lot of new things and gain a true experience of work culture. For example, a survey conducted by Oxford University found that teenagers, who share their hand to provide help to human beings in the community, gain maturity at an early age which helps them in the future to face any hurdle. Hence, it is a good idea to be mature if youngsters take part in unrewarded duty.\n\nFurther strengthening the viewpoint, an unpaid effort done by youth helps them in their academics as well. To elaborate, many institutions provide extra marks for voluntary trials done by adolescents and some interviewers also include this as an extracurricular activity. So if juveniles show up about unsalaried tasks to the community in their resume, they will surely get an advantage over the rest of the underage folks. For instance, a headline of âThe Moscow Timesâ published that even if students have good marks in other subjects but if they did not participate in voluntary work, they might lack somewhere in their future tasks. As a result, doing unrewarded duties can be a good approach in order to gain experience and use that later in their career.\n\nTo conclude, unsalaried work done by teenagers not only helps them grow their personality and character but also benefits in acing the goals in their future endeavours.",

Majority of teenagers need to know how to communicate with others in the best  way and how to do many things.

Secondary, many teenagers should do basic work without get  money to can be independent in the future. For example, when some teenagers  cook at a restaurant, they will obtain many information of cooking that is good for  them in next days. Finally, usually many people want money to work, but when  teenagers do not get any money for their working, they will be normally to do  something unpaid.  On another hand, the community receives benefits as well from unpaid working, so  people and teenagers who have free time have to do something for their community  to improve the pleasure between others. Furthermore, unpaid working increase the  relationship in the community that will rise the cooperation and the improvement in  their life.

I strongly agree with this notion, this essay will discuss how voluntary work helps a teenager to gain experience and it helps them to see themselves as valuable contributor to society. \n\nTo begin with, working in a community organization will help young individuals to learn new things apart from education. Also, education does not teach how to deal with real-life problems as it can be learned only through experience. Furthermore, working in the real world quickly teaches them certain skills which in future can be used in their resumes. To illustrate, when an individual works for a community they handle a lot of pressure which teaches them how to handle stress and t manage time.\n\nperhaps even more importantly, when enlistment volunteer themselves to help the community they realise that their actions have a positive impact on the world around them, which helps them grow as a person. Often, the problems in the public seem overwhelming but if students are given a chance to make at least a small change by helping or serving others it will make them responsible whilst contributing to the nation. For example, a survey has found that serving unpaid organizations has helped the nation to increase the literacy rate as people are aware of the roles and responsibilities at a young age itself. \n\nTo conclude, I totally agree that students should work for  unpaid communities not only for the betterment of the world but also, for their personal development. because I believe only working students can improve their skills while significantly creating a positive impact on humanity.",

    "essay": "The essay will be examining whether or not teenagers should volunteer to participate in activities that help the local community. I agree that the work done by teenagers would help both the teenagers and the society writ large by creating a sense of ownership and equity.\n\n Teenagers  in their formative years would benefit by volunteering as they would  learn about the society they live in and the problems that it faces. When teenagers volunteer to do work in their locality they are bound to face unique problems at some stage. These problems provide a fertile situation for teens to develop executive function, team work and problem solving skills which increases entreprenurial thinking amongst them. Moreover, apart from problem solving skills the best antidote to mental health problems is a strong personal connection to the area they live in. The number of friends and the size of one's social circle is a good predictor for overall well being of any individual. Thereby, volunteering would be beneficial to youngsters by helping them develop problem solving skills as well as improve their mental health.\n\nThe society would benefit from volunteer work by teens in two ways. The first way would be increased community participation on the part of parents, which in turn would increase probability of local government bodies functioning properly. Secondly, volunteer work by teenagers would improve overall societal cohesion as they would now be less likely to resort to crime or drugs as they have a support group available to them. Volunteer work, thereby would serve to improve interest in local government and help keep communites crime and drug free.\n\nIn Conclusion, volunteer work by teenagers would help them develop necessary skills to excel in the real world. As they say an empty mind is a devil's mind, volunteer work would serve to keep the teenagers enegaged and make them less likely to trod down the path of unproductive activities, while inculcating proper civic sensibilities and improve functioning of local government bodies.",

Personally speaking, I agree with the statement because in a community people have to work together if they want to live in a high living standard. \n\nWorking for their own community, teenagers could broaden their social skills and become aware of their role in a society. During that time, those people could get along with some senior locals and exchange experiences, for example. It is also the perfect way to start developing working skills when  delivering the mail, walking pets for their neighbors/the elders, cleaning pools, to start with. These are some services that an unexperienced teenager could get involved. In community service, teenagers do not have to have previous experience and it is not a demanding job which teenagers could easily learn from and understand the value of working. \n\nIf, from one side, one can number lots of benefits, on the other hand/side, some people can have bias against those kinds of jobs because they give the false impression that those who are serving the community are required to do so because they might have done something wrong or harmful to others, since these kinds of services are currently being used as punishment. Working for a community should not be a punishment in any circumstances. \n\nIn conclusion, we can see that motivating a teenager to do voluntary work is a posivite win-win attitude and, as result of this kind of job, community leaders could invest their effords in other important needs such as providing better heath and education structure in a feedback wheel.",

Some have argued that the youngers doing work in the association for free in their free time can have advantages both for the community and teenagers. Personally, I completely agree. In this essay, I will explain why this initiative will benefit teenagers and the neighbourhood.\n\nThe main reason why the younger should do unpaid community work is that teenagers can have a healthy lifestyle. There is no doubt that young students spending much free time gaming or studying means less time for exercise, and a much more sedentary lifestyle, which can result in chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease and diabetes. Students will have more opportunities to exercise instead of watching TV or playing video games, for instance, if those works are mandatory for them. The healthier life youngers have, the more chances to do what they want.\n\nIn addition, in terms of association, this behaviour will save a lot of money. The neighbourhood does not need to hire more staff because there are lots of youngers doing work for free. For example,  Teenagers can do some easy work such as cleaning and helping old people, which will cost a lot of budgets. Every dollar that can be saved on hiring staff can be invested in infrastructure, which can increase the well-being of habitats. Clearly, this initiative will be a benefit to the association in the long run.\n\nIn conclusion, I do believe that compulsory works have many advantages, not only for the younger physically healthy  but also for the development of the community.",

One of the biggest reasons of that reason is teenagers are more productive than old people and also they are stronger than old individuals as bodyly.

For example, when we take care of the elderly, they often bless us for our future endeavours and also share their invaluable life experience which can help an individual in tackling similar situations if they arise. Moreover, teenagers meet all sorts of people while working for this noble cause and can increase their network as well as learn to deal with real problems.

Therefore, giving a wage, even if it is small, will definitely attract more people towards community service.

For this reason, teenagers give some gift these aidless people and the more effective thing for these people whose live in charity camponies is chat with young and these people remember that they alive. This is not just correct for aidless old people this idea %100 true for other young aged or middle aged people whose need help for living their life.\n\n         In conclusion, parents, teachers, schools and governments shoould be support and give direction young people for working in charity clubs and it must be rule after the primary school. Our childiren can increase their best emotions that mercy and love and the world can be more peaceful and trustful place. Also, we can live confidently as part of their lifes.",

    "essay": "Young adults disciplines and their work-life  have always been a highly controversial issue. It is often argued that many hold the idea that occupying the  adolescents  ought to be compulsory regardless of  the salary as it could bring both personal merits and social plus points. I partially agree and disagree with this statement for two main reasons. This essay will elaborate on these opinions. \n\nTo commence,it is believed that early employments tend to bring a plethora of advantages. First of all, by being employed ,the seniors between the age of fourteen and sixteen might  become perfectly  skilled and provided  with job requirements such as  punctuality and financial management. Secondly,there is no shadow of a doubt that  If enlistments are invited to jobs in their early phases of adulthood they will achieve their goals faster.Therefore,  younger-age recruitments might pave the way for the candidates on their career path.\n\nOn the other hand, adulthood has always been a critical stage of life regarding  wise decisions. At this ,age human beings have  a tendency to make progress in the study and flourish their competencies. Following this  mandatory task,the  students will be deprived of their liberty in making choices .Similarly, this compulsory activity might pose an obstacle in their study advancements. Furthermore, a lucrative salary could play a key role in encouraging them to attract to the workforce. In other words, if they are not paid ,gradually ,they will become reluctant and find the occupation useless. To exemplify, child labour considers themselves a victim as well as adopting a pessimist approach to the future.\n\nTo conclude, although entering  young adults into the workforce can carry  a myriad of social and personal advantages. I reaffirm my position on this notion that I partially agree and disagree with it as  it is highly likely that they work the way  up the ladder and become highly successful in their professional life but they eventually  will lose their interest in employment due to the lack of  adequate salary",

    "essay": "These days extracurricular activities are becoming more and more popular. Some people think that high school should require students to do unpaid community service. This essay will discuss why unpaid social service should not be mandatory in part of high school programmes.\n\nTo begin with, not all students are wealthy, some have financial problems which can affect their educational pathway. In order to pay for the tuition fee, many people have to spend their free time on part-time jobs. If they are compelled to do non-paid services for society, they will not have enough time for earning extra money. For example, a large number of students in Thailand are working in the evening after finishing school, they have to help their parents to do some jobs otherwise they will not be able to have further study. Unpaid activities for society would be a huge obstacle for them in order to earn an income for the family. \n\nAdditionally, studying in high school is definitely caused massive stress on teenagers. Apart from learning various subjects in school, they should have their own free time to do whatever activities they want, so compulsory social activities should not be in part of the high school programmes. For instance, anxiety or stress-related disease in young adults has been significantly increasing, Forcing them to do unwanted activities may cause a negative impact on studentsâ mental health. Adolescents should have the opportunity to pursue their fascinating hobbies or other interesting activities such as playing guitar or spending a quality time with family.\n\n \n\nIn conclusion, non-paying social service should not be mandatory in part of the high school curriculum. Seeing that It will cause some students to struggle in earning extra budget and also be a stress trigger for many individuals.",

In my opinion, I totally agree with this viewpoint because this can bring several physical and mental benefits for youngsters.

To be more precise, it can help them avoid a sedentary lifestyle when they attained some physical activities instead of staying at home to play games or surf the web.

Extreme hunting and fishing practice have made it difficult for species to reproduce which results in limited availability of animals and sometimes leads to the extinction of certain species ,For example, Every weekend group of friends gather for fishing to spend some time together, since these activities are taking places in regular intervals it does not allow fishes to give birth to their offsprings, thus it affects the ecosystem and creates a loss of biodiversity. \n\nThe possible solution for this cause is to apply visiting restrictions by the government.The government should take  charge of such ponds where fishing is allowed and make it available to the general public  once in 6 months this will provide more time for fishes and other animals to reproduce which may result in an increased number of their breed. For instance, Dubai miracle garden have a diversity of flowers and since it has limited opening months It provides enough time for other plants and flowers to grow around them which remain intact and extinction of a particular type in such cases is least to impossible. \n\nIn conclusion, excessive hunting and fishing are one of the major reasons that result in loss of biodiversity , however this can be controlled if the government takes the matter in their own hand and set up some restrictions.",

Some people opine that it is important to involve teenagers to the local community  and give them an unpaid work. I strongly agree with this because this benefits both youngsters and society.\n\nTo begin with, there are two merits for the younger generations. Firstly, they are able to get work experience. There are important things that youngsters need to know other than school subjects. For instance, communication skill is vital at a workplace. Volunteer works in the community provide teenagers opportunities to learn how to communicate with seniors in life. In addition, this enhances school studies at the same time. Since youngsters engage works in  society, this help to understand social structures.\n\nOn top of that,  society also receives merits. At first, teenagers can animate  society. For instance, they often clean up a town and plant trees and flowers in Japan. This makes the atmosphere of  society better and brighter. In addition to this, adults are able to widen their perspectives thanks to the younger generation. In general, the younger generation has the flexible way of thinking, and they catch information faster than adults. Giving seniors an opportunity to get in touch with teenagers, they can learn new things and refresh their way of thinking.\n\nTo conclude, I reiterate my complete agreement with this topic for two reasons. This is because teenagers are able to learn important skills such as communication and social structures, and enhance school learnings, and the society is animated by them.",

I totally agree with that opinion as there are a lot of young teen who consume their time for unhealthy activities. This essay will discuss why teenagers must join with community tasks.\n\nTo begin with, teenagers have good health and sharp minds to help their communities. To make it clear, this means the age of 15 to 22 years old is regarded as puberty with well-being and creativity. They can learn fast and use their power to assist others. For example, a young teen might spend their hours after school to go to a nursing home or hospital and support the staff to run errands. Clearly, the youngster is stronger and smarter than other ages, therefore they should give a hand to teen  who are living around them. \n\nAdditionally, these growing teen are developing their life skills, thus, it is crucial to volunteer and correct their demerits. Nowadays, there are a bunch of teenagers who prefer spending their leisure time on computer and smartphone without interacting with other teen. This shapes their personalities and cognition to be slow and dependable. However, if they go outside and collaborate with others, they definitely pick up on a variety of useful lessons. For instance, a youngster who would like to volunteer for daycare, she probably can gain some skills of taking care of kids and others. Thus, volunteering benefits each individual if they aspire to perfect their moralities. \n\nIn conclusion, contributing effort for the community brings many advantages for young teen, and helps them to establish their goals in the future.",

This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. I believe it has many advantages to offer rather than disadvantages for teenagers.\n\nVolunteering for community service is a good practice for teenagers it helps them understand various aspects of life and aspire them to be good citizens. These kinds of services develop them emotionally and teach them to counter various difficult situations. Such services are not only beneficial to the teenagers but also helps other members of society for example volunteering in old age home not only makes them benevolent but also gives them the idea of accountability, whereas for elderly people they act as a sense of accompanying and can be the assistance of various kinds. I rather strongly feel community service is a good alternative to spending free time idle and non-productive. Social service also makes teenager self-reliant and prepare them for essential key skills required for then to grow in the society like team building, adjusting with new people and social duty.\n\nHowever, there is some downside to these services especially for teenagers, since their young minds are extremely impressionable working in a community can expose them to the dark side of  society which can be difficult for them to cope. There are chances of exploitation if left unsupervised. In some cases, teenagers lose their focus on their school and studies and fall into bad company. Such all incidents can be avoided if well supervised and worked in a balanced manner. \n\nIn my ,conclusion unpaid community work is a noble act and should be encouraged in every school. Such practices are idle for the all-around development of young minds and nurture them to be stand up citizens .",

    "essay": "Holidays are deemed  necessary for the employee to rest so they can perform better. The length of days off may vary, but many believe that company should give their workers a minimum of a month per year. I believe that this is important to prevent burnout and improve overall health so they can do their assigned task well.\n\nTo begin with, holidays are vital for everyone, including workers. The company should allow their workers to leave the office for up to months per year to prevent burnout. Burnout which commonly occurs in workers, especially in a high-pressure environment, may predispose to bad decision-making and a decline in work performance. Moreover, staff may opt to leave the company that treats them badly by forcing them to work without sufficient days off. For instance, many young workers are resigned from their job in a startup company due to stress in the high-pressure environment. Hence, it is important for  business owners to give their employers several days off to take a good rest and maintain their mental well-being so they can perform well in their jobs.\n\nSecondly, vacations are necessary to maintain the staff's general health. Overworked and tired workers may lead to a decline in work performance and decision-making. Proper sleep and rest are vital in maintaining good health to perform daily tasks. For example, a tired doctor on 24 hours shift may make mistakes in assessing and treating their patients that may lead to malpractice. Therefore, it is important for a company to allow their staff to take time off the office so they can rest peacefully and fully recharge their stamina in order to perform their responsibilities.\n\nIn conclusion,  business owners should give their workers sufficient time for a vacation to maintain the employee's mental and physical health as it is vital for people to do their job well.",

    "essay": "It is understandable that financial stability is a primary concern for many people, and it is often cited as the main reason for staying in the workforce. However, I disagree with the notion that money is the most important factor in motivating people to continue working. While it is certainly a significant consideration, there are other reasons that can be equally, if not more, influential in an individual's decision to stay in their job.\n\nOne such factor is a sense of accomplishment. Many people derive a great deal of fulfilment from their work, particularly if they feel that they are making a positive contribution to society. This sense of purpose and meaning can be a powerful motivator, even if it is not directly tied to financial rewards. In fact, research has shown that people who find meaning and purpose in their work are more likely to be satisfied and engaged in their jobs, which can lead to improved productivity and overall job satisfaction.\n\nPersonal growth is another factor that can influence an individual's decision to stay in the workforce. Many people find that their job provides opportunities for learning and development, and this can be a strong incentive to continue working. Additionally, the chance to advance in one's career and take on new challenges can also be a motivating factor.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the importance of money as a motivator can vary depending on a person's personal circumstances. For those who are in a financially secure position, other factors such as personal growth and fulfilment may become more important. On the other hand, for those who are struggling financially, the prospect of a higher salary or better benefits may be a strong incentive to stay in the workforce.\n\nIn conclusion, while money is certainly an important factor in motivating people to stay in the workforce, it is not the only reason. Other factors such as a sense of accomplishment, personal growth, and the opportunity to make a positive impact can also play a significant role in an individual's decision to continue working.",

    "essay": "To motivate and retain skillful and talented people in the workforce of our ever fast changing society, many companies have been contemplating what the most important factors are in their employees' perspectives. Because capitalism and materialism are two of the most significant driving principles of societal growth, one would argue that money must be the most important factor.\n\nIt's obvious that tangible rewards such as commissions, bonuses and promotions are always given to individuals based on their performances, all of these rewards are distributed in the form of money. This basic feedback mechanism has been working exceptionally well in terms of productivity for many centuries in Western countries. Progress and advancements in technology and industrial revolution made this case clearer than ever.\n\nFinancial gain allows basic working class to put bread and butter on the table, to stay cozy under a roof and provide basic needs for the family. Money is especially important for these grassroot people as it's impractical to pursue other non-monetary goals when you are just trying to make ends meet.\n\nOn the other hand, middle to upper class often stride for a more lucrative career path in order to accumulate wealth for other lifelong investments, which can often lead to early retirement and a more fulfilling, enjoyable later life.\n\nThere are other factors like workplace relationship, job satisfaction and company social responsibility that can affect employees' prospects. Companies should also consider these aspects in order to maximise the development and retention of their workforce. However, when people have to make a choice in career or job change, money and opportunity of promotion are two of the most significant elements that influence their choices.",

    "essay": "It is a general perception that monetary gain is the most significant driving force that keeps an employee or an entrepreneur working. However, in my opinion, this is certainly not the only reason to keep it up.\n\nTo begin, Happiness and self-contentment while working are the most underrated but paramount measures. For instance, a person who feels truly satisfied carries on with his performance quite consistently and efficiently. On contrary, if he is not content working, money alone cannot put him together any longer and he might switch his current job for a desired one.\n\nSecondly, the nature of tasks and personal moral values should not be contradictory. This means that a person can only carry on with his effort if it falls within his moral limits and virtuous boundaries. For example, A man with the right upbringing and values cannot stay longer on an earning platform which is not legit.  In other words, those banknotes cannot be a consistent motivation in a situation like this.\n\nThirdly, mental well-being is as important as physical strength. One cannot perform better with compromised mental strength. Moreover, no amount of money can attract him. The working environment matters to some people more than financial values. These are the righteous kind of people who are enough considerate of their mental well-being. They cannot function in a sick or toxic environment where dirty politics is being played and there is no act of justice or fairness served.\n\nTo conclude, although, one cannot deny the importance of financial statistics, the attributes like self-satisfaction, happiness, mental fitness and quality of work are equally or in some cases more important.",

    "essay": "In this contemporary era, staying in the job market has become indispensable for people and many reasons are underlying this trend along with the pursuit of making money. This essay will discuss the reasons for being  part of the workforce of people and why money is on the top of that list.\n\nTo initiate, we can say that there can be some career goals which compel people to stay in the work market and even make them stay work late hours. Professionals don't leave their jobs so that they can get more and more work experience and award  promotions and certain desired positions in long run. Even women are also in this race and not ready to compromise their careers on the family because they also have the motives of getting  managerial positions. Besides this, the masses work to get job benefits, for instance, insurance and free vacations with family to Europe and other fascinating destinations. For example, according to a survey held by California University in 2010, it was observed that because of such alluring benefits offered by the corporate sector , people prefer not to leave them. Therefore, in the quest of getting managerial positions along with job benefits, communities prefer to stick with their offices.\n\nHowever, the most important factor in this regard is money. Folks are working day and night to make more and more money as money is the ultimate need of life in this fast pacing age. Men and women want to have a better living standard ,moreover, they want to give a better future to their kids. For example, according to a survey done in Pakistan, more than 80 per cent of people present in the workforce, are motivated to make money for better living standards. Hence, money is the top reason for this trend.\n\nIn conclusion, considering all the aspects, it can be said that there can be ample factors which compel professionals to stay in the workforce. I completely support this notion that along with many other reasons, money is the most essential and important factor, because of which folks are motivated to work.",

    "essay": "With the increase in the number of visitors to tourist sites, nowadays, It has become a common thing to see used objects and containers thrown around tourist sites. Even worse, some foreigners who come to visit try to brainwash the local people and debunk their culture. Recently, People who have observed this has tried to organize a movement to try to avoid these and be responsible tourist. However, despite  their claim, they are yet to get the trust of the public as many people believe it is impossible for every tourist to be responsible. In this essay, I will give my opinion on how hard it is to generalise for large groups of visitors and how it should be claimed and understood instead. \n\nThere are many visitors who really care and worry about the places they usually go to visit. And they usually come up with innovative ideas on how to improve the system in handling the preservation of culture and environment. For instance, last year 8 Australian tourists who went to visit a historical place in Sudan  found the environment around to be in an alarming state. and Immediately after they went back home they were able to raise funds that will be used to clean the surroundings and renovate the historical area. So, although not every tourist is responsible, there are genuine tourists who want to protect the environment they go to visit.\n\nNeedless to say, however, there is a large swath of people who does things that harm the tourist sites. Some don't care about the objects they use and where they throw them. And others are busy trashing the local culture just because it doesn't align with their way of living or the culture they came from. For instance, during the last world cup people were criticizing Qatar for not allowing similar-gender marriage and trying to impose their own culture.\n\nTherefore, saying every tourist will be responsible is impractical. But at the same time, we can not generalize the acts of some bad people to every tourist as there are  many good tourists who genuinely want to protect the culture and environment. So, the narrative that responsible tourists have started to pay attention to protecting the environment should not be taken literally and it should not be understood negatively. It instead should be encouraged and the people who took the initiative to start the movement should be appreciated as this is how things improve and eventually it might become a norm for every tourist.",

However many individuals guess that is hard for them to take part in this responsibility. In my opinion, I strongly believe that everyone should be aware of keeping these places clean and safe.\n\nFirst and foremost, Nowadays social media plays a vital role to share the importance of preserving historical buildings of every country by the foreign people during their journeys since behind every monumental place there is a deep and meaningful story. As a result, saving our cultures means saving our identities. For instance, the community of Tangier in Morocco have done a lot of efforts such as recruiting of about 70 security agents in all museums of the city and plentiful signs hanging at the main door for giving more details about the story of each building.\n\nSecondly, the number of travelling by airplanes has decreased recently which affects positively our environment consequently this act leads to reducing air pollution around the globe. As a ,result human beings become aware of the bad effect of  unnecessary travel. In addition. many governments have been doing several efforts for saving our planet like encouraging their citizens to choose local tourists and discovering the charm of their countries. A survey showed that China has provided support for the tourism sector by offering attractive discounts for reservations at local resorts. \n\nTo sum up, I am still convinced that all citizens have to pay more attention to saving culture and the environment and becoming aware of the actual situation of our climate and our planet.",

Although museums are the places for countries histories, in my opinion, without some entertainment facilities they will be boring for people.\n\nOn the one hand, museums are constructed to give people some information about history which can be boring without being enjoyable places to amuse communities. First of all, many people go there in their leisure time and spend time with their families or friends. So if museums are not fascinating for people, they will not go there anymore. In addition, museums should absorb audiences in some different simple ways. For instance, a tour guide to express information to visitors can be interesting, establishing many entertainment facilities like some shopping, restaurants, and coffee shops or children's parks. On the other, many museums are located near amusement parks to grab peopleâs attention. For example, Some bonuses or discounts on amusement park tickets are given to those who visit the museum to attract more visitors which is held in some European countries like the UK, Spain and so on.\n\nHowever, many opine that museums are built for educational purposes. Many students and artists go there on tours in schools or universities to gain some information about the history. , if the museum is an enjoyable place for all range of ages, no one will concentrate on the main aim of the museum which is education. Secondly, they are packed with all types of people which is not appropriate for children and students.

Both the arguments need a proper scrutiny before forming an opinion and I would like to explicate in the paragraphs to come.\n\nThe advocates of first view deem that museums are a good way to entertain people.  Past portraits and drawings are a source of attraction which gather a lot of people from every corner of the world. Public love to visit these old buildings  to spend some recreational period. Moreover, the visual graphics add more taste in the entertainment which  mostly people prefer to watch as they visualize a lot of information in a less span of time. University of Britain, for example, states that people get attracted to those places twice where visual and audio for the place runs together instead of  just information about the subject has provided.\n\nOther people argue that museums are proved beneficial if they are used for educational purposes. Museums are helpful in broaden the horizon of the person. Due to the upgrading of the museums by installing latest technologies in them, most of the schools organize trips to the museums in order tocollect infomation about the past, a number of vistors come to visit  these buildings to complete projects and know about other cultures and past activities.

While some argue that going to a museum should be an amusing experience, others believe that its sole purpose is to educate. I believe they should be both entertaining and educational.

Visitors should leave having learned information they did not previously. To achieve this several different methods are employed, like headsets that lecture people while they see the collections or a guide that tours the museum explaining its content. For instance, it is common to see big groups of tourist tours parading in museums guided by someone who speaks to them in their own language facilitating their interpretation of what they are looking at.\n\nIn conclusion, museums are a place where people can learn about art, science and culture in an enjoyable way.

Furthermore, some people; especially history students, visit museum in order to learn different things.

If there is going to be too much educational content, some visitors might become bored and that way less people will be interested in visiting places like that. Nevertheless, museums are tourist attractions and attract many visitors in general, so big part of society thinks, that they should emphasize the enjoyment, create more interactive activities or some sort of games, so that the exhibitions could be more entertaining for people of all ages and that way more people would take interest in visiting places like that.\n\nOn the other hand, a big part of the society believes that not everything in this world should be all about fun and games. They are sure that the main point of any exhibition is to help people learn about something they did not know previously. This means that the story behind every exhibit should be explained, and this can be done in various ways. Some museums have professional guides, and the others offer audio guides, so that the visitors can listen to a commentary about every single object and explore them by themselves. That way people do not have to read long and boring descriptions and then museums can play a big part in helping people broaden their knowledge in many different aspects of life.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that museums should be a place, where you can do both â broaden your knowledge and have some fun at the same time.

It is respectful that people built up museums is for yearning the past most museums were build for exactly this reason.

Paying the revere is the basic requirement for people their entering the museum as we are facing our ancestorsâ story and learn to be grateful and understand why we need to cherish the memory of the dead soldiers.\n\nIn conclusion, people many regard museums as a kind of real-life history book for youngsters and a place we need to protect well. Therefore, I agree believe the museum is to educate people to understand the past and to be grateful for it",

    "essay": "In this modern era, few masses think that museums  thought applies enjoyable places to entertain the community. But others believe the purpose of the museum is to educate. In my opinion, the former notion has several elements that deserve attention and I will explain its views in the upcoming paragraph thus will lead to a logical conclusion.\n\nThere are myriad applied arguments in favour of my context, and the most conspicuous one lies in the fact that people should be extra careful with their decisions. For example, according to a recent survey done by Stanford University, 45per cent of the masses take benefit from the above-mentioned notion, whereas 30per cent of the population faces demerits due to it. Hence, it is apparent why many citizens are in favour of the above stance.\n\nAnother argument in support of my view is that communities worldwide have become more active in dealing with this situation. To illustrate, as per apply academic research carried out by the Australian government, 60per cent of society gained immensely from the museums. They improved their existing scenario tremendously and that paved the way for a better economic future. Therefore, not only will this make the public more careful and pragmatic in their approach, but also it will lead to a better living standard.\n\nBefore hammering the last nail, one can conclude that museums should be applied enjoyable places to entertain the public.

    "essay": "In the last few years, the debate regarding museums has been raised. Some people believe that museums are a place where you gain knowledge and education. However, Some others claim that  historical places like museums should be attractive and enjoyable to the public. I believe that museums are  educational places but also they can be entertaining to attract more visitors. \n\nOn one hand, a historical gallery is a place where the visitors explore the history of nations. In addition, they can learn about the tools as well as the methods that had been used in the ancient era. For instance, the Louvre museum exhibits  ancient Egyptian clothes and statues. As a consequence, such galleries should not accept any entertaining activities that will disrupt the tourists. \n\nOn the other hand, recreational activities inside the museums will attract more community members to come and learn about our history. Furthermore, such activities will enhance the people experience as well as encouraging them to bring their children. For example, display a relevant adventure movie with high-quality sound, this movie may focus on some historical events in order to gain youth attention. Moreover, some ancient venues organize competitions to bring more participants as well as more media coverage. As a result, more revenue can be generated to support the employee's salaries  together with expansion projects.\n\nIn conclusion, museums are a great venue to gain knowledge regarding ancient events. Although it is an educational zone, we can include some enjoyable shows. Such activities will motivate more youth and children to visit museums. This can include movie shows and competitions.",

While some individuals argue that its role is to entertain visitors, others believe that it should be an educational role. In this essay, both sides of the argument will be discussed in detail and I will provide my opinion why I support the former view. \n\nOn the one hand, it can be argued that the main purpose of museums is entertainment. Since they are tourist-attraction places, they should exhibit enjoyable objects and programmes. In other words, if tourists have to read too much educational content, they may quickly get bored. Therefore, some museums have interactive activities or even games to encourage people to visit them. The most salient example of this is the Chocolate Museum in Korea and the Cheese Museum in the Netherlands. Thus, museums may be considered mainly as recreational places. \n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that museums should have an educational role. This is because they showcase the countryâs valuable cultural items. For instance, The Egyptian Museum in Cairo which exhibits plenty of pharaonic objects. Therefore, some museums employ a tour guide in order to explain the history of every piece to tourists. Other places offer CDs or brochures for the same purpose. Indeed, only when visitors are taught this information will it be possible to save such a culture.\n\nIn conclusion, although some individuals believe that museumsâ fundamental role is to entertain its visitors, I think the purpose of them should be educational in order to save the culture as well as the history of the country.",

    "essay": "Museums are the major tourist attractions in every country.  Some people believe that museum tours should be filled with fun so that they can enjoy more, whereas others think that they are meant to provide information and educate people. In my opinion, I agree with the notion of museums reserved for educating the visiting crowd, rather than entertaining them.\n\nFirstly, people visit historical places like museums or art galleries to know the ancient stories of that particular place. With museums depicting the past glories or the sacrifices made by the ancestors of that place, it connects the visitors with the local community. One cannot look for entertainment at all places, as some are reserved for specific purposes. For instance, students are taken to museums with an intention of connecting them with the history and culture of the land. The antique materials that are preserved in such places, provides the much needed information about life in those days. This will also inspire students to achieve greater things in life as they get connected with famous personalities and their lifestyle.\n\nOn the other hand, although, art and science galleries are informative, it becomes a bit boring to the younger generation due to a lot of restrictions. People should be allowed to perform some tasks related to the theme of museums. Besides, introducing some interactive programs like stage shows or live experiments will engage the audience effectively. Not everyone who visits the museum is looking for lessons or information, hence innovative concepts should be introduced to make their visit more enjoyable. As a result, people get the information required as well as being entertained at the same time.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe museums are meant for providing knowledge, whether it is art, science, culture or any other theme-based museums, their main motto is to educate the crowd. The public who are looking for entertainment should make other choices and should not enforce the authorities to alter the functioning of museums.",

Some people consider this place as a source of entertainment while others believe it is a place of gaining abundance of knowledge. This essay will discuss both sides of argument and will provide an evidence as to why these exhibitions should be called more reliable resource of education.  \n\nAdmittedly, Museums are a place where people of all ages can lavishly enjoy their time. There are a large number of cities who have made plethora of investments in these museums in order to make them enticing for today's generation. They charge certain amounts to tourists and provide them numerous facilities so that they can spend their leisure time enjoying these arts. There is no doubt that it should be a great way to release boredom and do something different as opposed to daily schedules. People tend to see ample of traditional equipment, objects which they find very interesting. For instance, India's capital Delhi gives a great opportunity to its visitors to pay attention to the large numbers of exhibits as a source of entertainment at very minimal cost. Therefore, these exhibitions surely give people a chance to have fun with their beloved ones. \n\nOn the other hand, we must not forget the advantages of having these places with an educational point of view. Today's youth show a great interest in the history and these places provide them a chance to enhance their knowledge with regard to the ancient times. They get to know more about the science as well as customs of nation. Recently, a survey was performed in one of the universities, India and it has shown that 58% of the students admitted the fact that Museums are very helpful providing them education related to the old times. Furthermore, by getting this information, children find more interest in their studies just because they actually experience the same in a variety of exhibitions. Practical knowledge always helps all of them in remembering histories rather than learned skills. \n\nTo recapitulate with, while Museums are considered to be fascinating places for everyone in terms of entertainment, their importance towards education can not be neglected.",

Therefore, before commenting on my decision, both the view will be discussed further.\n\nFocussing on the first view, the most important argument the supporters put forward is that museums should be excited place. Firstly, tourist peoples like to visit those places, where they find entertainment as well as historical arts and museum is the only place, which attracts them most, in result, it increase in popularity of that place. Secondly, teenagerâs gets excited when come to have both things at one place, this means that they would concentrate more in learning something if they find entertainment at the same location. For instance, in United Kingdom, many museums which do not have academic purpose, instead this they dÃ©cor their location in theme like gaming centre, which encourage more people to visit.\n\nOn the other hand, the latter view believer say that museums should know as academic institute. To begin with, many time scientist like to go museums, because historical and interesting objects takes place there, their aim is to leaning something new from there, so they do not like if that place convert into entraining. Moreover, School teacherâs thinks that a tour museum can teach students in practical way than in reality they cannot teach in school, like skeletons of some animals, which needs to have practical learning. For example, in school of America, itâs mandatory to take a tour of museums every Friday so that they understand effectively.\n\n To conclude and give my opinion, I would support the former view that museums should also contain some entertaining themes. Although, it is the best location for practical learning, I believe that museum would more grow once we add required things for tourist and teenagers.",

    "essay": "While some demographics of society opine that museums should act as entertainment hubs, critics argue that these sites should foster educational values among visitors. Although both the conflicting perceptions have their own justification, I strongly agree with the latter viewpoint.\n\nIt is fairly easy to comprehend why some individuals are in harmony with the former assertion. This is simply because they believe if there is too much emphasis on acquainting visitors with historic and scientific facts, people will feel boredom and it will probably restrict their revisiting tendency; consequently, the statistics pertaining to visits to these exhibitions centres will drop exponentially. In order to avoid this downfall, art galleries should serve the purpose of entertainment by acting as entertainment outlets which will definitely allure the target audience, especially the youngsters. To illustrate, unique and fascinating games at museums not only help to rejuvenate exhausted minds but also encourage individuals to visit again and again. In short, being able to amuse masses means museums will be able to survive and thrive.\n\nMeanwhile, I along with others firmly criticise this idea and acknowledge that these sites can work wonders in promoting cultural awareness when these are focused at educating individuals. When masses see astonishing collection of artefacts used previously by their ancestors, they would be able to make fine judgements about cultural values which are regarded as soul of every culture; resultanly, they will get deep understanding of their culture. For example, one can get amazing experience of Punjabi culture by visiting Khalsa heritage, museum located at Anandpur Sahib, as curators available over there provide guidance about the exhibited tools and objects. Thus, these exhibition centres could prove extremely advantageous in familiarising people with their cultural roots if these are aimed at educating masses.\n\nConclusively, despite the fact that museums could provide recreational and entertaining activities, I would argue the main aim of these sites must be to educate people.",

Museums are created to preserve our reach societal heritage and landslide achievement in all field of endeavour. Places of such repute should not only be interesting but also entertaining so as to encourage people to visit it. In this essay I will be  discussing both sides and giving my opinion at the end.\nInterestingly, museums are built for the purpose of preserving history for the future generation.

The story of our cultural and historic transition contains landmark and heroic achievement by different great minds which are place in video documentary in some museums.

They are made as safe haven for some historical and cultural monuments of great value to the people.

    "essay": "An increasing number of criminals have done by children and teenagers in some regions of the world. The main causes of this problem are the lack of parentsâ attention and living with so-called bad environments. Several solutions should be implemented to punish them.\n\nFirstly, parents are working so hard in the office resulting lack of attentiveness to their sweet ones. In the development of children, once they do not feel the love of adults, the children tend to do crime for the sake of getting attention. For instance, fighting each other or stealing in a supermarket as a prerequisite to enter a gangster that they think can engage the love of a family. Secondly, it is mainly because of living surrounded by unsupported environments. Fighting and verbal abuse have been affected their thoughts which enable them to think and live positively in society.\n\nThere are two possible solutions to punish the youngers. One way is through physical punishment by sending to children prison. This is intended to do the rehabilitation and teach them moral and ethical behaviour. When they come back to the community, they will have such positive insights as well as new skills that hopefully help them to live in a society. Another way is by giving the love and attention of parents to them. By loving them unconditionally, it would affect the childrenâs psychology that they are loved. In this manner, feeling supportive parents would make them more precious.\n\nTo sum up, the main causes of the problem are lack of attention and effected by bad environments.

    "essay": "With the development of our society, there is a noteworthy phenomenon that more and more people do not stay in one job position in all their careers, which means people now change their job frequently. This essay will give several factors that why this happened and will give some suggestions to solve this problem.\n\nThe first reason why people changed their job frequently is due to the job market nowadays is much better than it was in the past. Now, there are more jobs for people to choose from in the job market than in the old times. So people will have more chances to join  a new position in the same field or switch to a completely new field due to  society's development.\n\nThe second reason is that the cost for people to live  a decent life costs much more than it  used to. So people always want their salary incremented each year. The best way to achieve this is to switch their job to a different company. That's the second reason why employee changed their jobs \n\nfrequently.\n\nThe third factor is that the employee are easier to get bored with what they have done in the company, and thanks to the development of the internet. People have a way to find what they are interested in and the internet helps people  learn new knowledge or technology easily. It provides a convenient way for people to switch their jobs. It also causes people  not to stay in one position for a long time.\n\nBut this phenomenon may do a little harm to the company because it may lose some expertise employees and if they want to hire  new employees with the same quality, it requires them to pay more salaries to them, which may influence the company's development and profits. So there should have some measures to alleviate this phenomenon happened. The company could provide a clear path for employees to get promoted and give some employees who perform well a good bonus. It will  make employees feel safe and satisfied. What's more, a good work-life balance is also a key factor to reduce the leaving rate for employees.",

People have differing views with regard to the question of changing the location of bureau from the urban to suburban areas. There are merits and drawbacks in this issue, personally I support that pros are overtaken cons in the topic and I will discuss my point of view in this essay.\n\nHeavy traffic is one of the most concerned for people who lived in the cities. They not only have to experience a rush living, but also a constitutional problem of the pollution which expended from the vehicles. Additionally, traffic jam can make people developed emotional diseases, for instance, depression, which made them less effective in their living.

    "essay": "Nowadays, there are many people who contact by using social media sites rather than contacting face-to-face. The advantages of this trend such as the connection at any time or place outweigh their drawbacks. This essay will discuss these benefits in depth in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe first benefit of the connection virtually rather than the actual method is the possibility of making a chat or call at any time. Because the users do not require anything, expect a good internet connection, to be kept in touch with their friends. For example, the possibility of contacting at any time is increasing the contact among the Facebook users according to the London City University report in 2020. Without such time flexibility, the number of online connection users may are not enhanced. Therefore, the time flexibility in the social media connection is the benefit that outweighs any impact of replacing face-to-face relations.\n\nFurthermore,  contact in the virtual world is the easiest way to meet your international people or friends. Because in this world there are no boundaries and anyone can call or meet their public regardless their nations. For instance, each family have an online group either a massager or WhatsApp group in order to meet together, even if there are some members are living in different countries. Without a group like this, many family members may not connect for many ages. Therefore, among the advantages of replacing the direct way of contact is the possibility of gathering people together in one conversation regardless of their places. \n\nIn conclusion, this essay agreed that the benefits of replacing face-to-face connections with networks through social media apps outweigh their impacts. The replacing of the normal connection method with an online alternative provide more connection at any time and from any site.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, most people think that children should be punished when they commit crimes, while others believe parents should be punished rather than their kids. In this essay, I will discuss both sides and will favour the latter view. \n\nOn the one hand, people suggest that offspring should be punished due to their bad behaviours. In this way, they donât repeat their negative actions. For instance, when a child commits a crime such as  fighting with peers, parents can give punishment to their kid, including a restriction on video games and meeting with peers. When children get these types of penalties, they can understand that their behaviour was wrong, resulting in them tendency to leave these acts behind them. Also, little ones can learn their every negative action has some consequences. \n\nOn the other hand, some people believe that parents should get penalties due to being role models for their kids. The children spend most of their time with their family members since they are born, and their parents become the main characters in their life. Therefore, kids tend to imitate their father and mother in terms of their behaviours and moral values. For example, if little one sees that his/her dad screams when arguing with other people, they perceive this act as normal, resulting in copying this behaviour. \n\nIn conclusion, although some people claim that children should get penalties because of committing crimes, I believe that parents have a majority of responsibility for their kidsâ actions due to be role models in their offspring's life.",

Some individuals who may be inclined to commit a crime may become emboldened by the attention given to similar crimes in the media. This phenomenon is known as the \"copycat effect,\" and it has been observed in numerous instances where the media has given extensive coverage to a particular crime.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that detailed descriptions of crimes in newspapers and TV can have negative consequences on society, banning such information from the media is not the solution. The media has a responsibility to report  crimes and events that occur in society, and censorship can lead to an erosion of democratic principles. Instead, we should focus on addressing the root causes of crime and implementing effective solutions to reduce crime in our society.",

Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-abiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.\n\nAn even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.\n\nMost importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced.Without their consent this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer as they may be false may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.",

Therefore, parents cannot take their eyes off their children. In such a situation, it is almost impossible to balance work and childcare. Consequently, some people say that fathers should take parental leave. In the following essay, I would argue both sides and state that I tend to agree with the idea.\n\nFirst of all, it is true that the company will be in trouble because the employees are time-off from work. When the labour force decreases, the firm has to get rid of the situation by reallocate other employees to the blank post. However, if a person who has left was an expert and irreplaceable worker, they might struggle to find a substitute people. Furthermore, during the worker is absent, the company has to support them financially even though they are not working. To sum up, parental leave might be a burden for the company.\n\nSecond of all, on the other hand, fathers are responsible to take part in childcare. In the past world, a plethora of people believed that only mothers should participate in nurturing and the responsible for fathers is little. However, in the modern world, both gender should be treated equal and it is same in a relationship of a family. Consequently, since rely only on a power of mothers is unfair, not only mothers but also fathers should take time-off and cooperate to nurture as a parent.\n\nIn my conclusion, I believe that the fathers should take parental leave even though the firm will be suffered from getting substitute worker temporarily.

The reason is clear because they were not familiar with opposite sex during their initial days. Thus, it will impact the workflow as well as output of both employee and employers. In addition to it, they may face competition in latter life. These days females and mens can perform task without any gender discrimation. Mens are also seen in culinary activities. If they lose to study together they will not be aware of the amount of competiton they can receive from womens. \n\nThe another reason is trust issues may enter into the life. From education places juveniles can learn to trust each others. For instance, girls are abused by many boys sexually and mentally after they got married especially in India. Many girls are affraid to marry a guy because they do not know how men can handle them due to the same sex places. It will result into lower level of trust. Additionally, they may affraid to talk and sit with strangers owing to the news about rapes and murdered of girls.\n\nIn conclusion, parents have right to decide the starting schooling based on preference of same sex or both. However, one sex education place have many issues. Moreover, I firmly believe that childern should have right to study in co educational places so that they can know the cooperation, how to work with each other and how to trust all.",

    "essay": "It is undeniable that single-sex schools and co-educational ones are totally different in terms of school policies. However, some people propound that sending their children to co-educational is more beneficial when they grow up. In my opinion, I agree with this statement. \n\nOn the one hand, co-educational schools has many benefits to children. To put it simply, most parents believe that co-educational environment is more pleasant as there is no separation between boys and girls, which is important because kids will be able to have better understandings of other genders. Also, such environment promotes life-long friendship. The earlier students know each other, the longer relationship lasts. Take an example of Thai students, almost all schools encourage children to have friends from other schools by local community activities. \n\nOn the other hand, it is considered by many that single-sex schools are outdated, which many countries have already abolished this practice for many decades. To put it further, it seem to me that this method have many drawbacks. Firstly, it encourages children to become highly competitive and isolates children from other genders. That is to say, children might never have an opportunity to get to know friends who have a different gender, therefore, they will have a much smaller circle of friends, compared to the co-educational schools. As a result of this, some students may lack of relationships with other sexes. \n\nIn conclusion, most parents find co-educational schools more advantageous because they can have  better chances later in life. From my perspective, I completly agree with this notion.",

Even though there are some advantages, many people believe that children who are going to  same-sex schools have disadvantages in the future. I strongly agree with this view and will explain my ideas in this essay.\n\nFirstly, childhood is a golden age where  kids are able to learn everything about life. If since when they were  kids and have not had an opportunity to interact with the opposite gender, they will feel awkward or hard to socialize later in the real world condition. They will never understand there is a difference between both sexes. Moreover, this condition might hinder them from having a good social skills in the future.\n\nSecond, if the children are taught in a mixed-sex class, they have an opportunity to learn from a different point of view. Boys and girls think differently, they also have  varied ways to express their feelings. Furthermore, if they have a lack of exposure to such experiences, it will make them if facing a problem later. In addition, the worst scenario is this could also lead to marital issues and could turn into unpleasant situations.\n\nTo sum up, even though parents these days have an opportunity to choose to send their kids to single-sex schools or mixed-sex school, I believe there is a lot advantage if they choose to enrol their kids on coeducational schools, and the experiences will help the kids to interact in social interaction in the future.",

I partially agree with this statements because of two reasons.\n\nFirstly, there are so many reasons why the parents deicide to go to single-sex schools for children such as, the child who has some disadvantages when relate with girls due to traumatized or something. In this case, it is difficult to go to a co-educational school by the child. Moreover, children are possible to consantration more about study because there are no relationships with other genders.

As a result, parents are the ability to think and they know what is best for their kids. They have choices in the schools. In recent years, co-educational is not provided in every society but nowadays we can see in every community there is an option to choose.

A certain segment of individuals argues that  those who attend  single-sex schools might have disadvantages later on in their lives. In my opinion, I raise my hand with the supporters of this notion, and the following paragraphs of this essay will analyze two factors which will contribute to this affirmation, as well as my opinion.\n\nTo begin with, co-educational scholars develop gender respect skills. In the modern-day world, we can lot of problems related to gender respect, people lack in skills to understand the opposite gender's feelings and problems. For these types of issues, we need to build a society from the beginning, from the school level. Hence, co-education comes in handy in teaching these skills to students. For example, at school where both  girls and boys are present, they get to know each other feelings and problems, thus they get to understand how to respect each other. \n\nBesides that, mixed schools develop teamwork. In the real world, we have to work with each other, we have to share with others, in other words, teamwork is essential. Even in the workplace, we have to reach certain goals or targets by working together. In mixed schools, there are opportunities to develop this skill in many ways. For instance, the kids may get involved to do certain kinds of projects and assignments together, by doing these things they get to learn how to perform  teamwork. Furthermore, they learn to bare each other which is also an essential part of everyday life.\n\nTo conclude, I reiterate single-sex scholars might get disadvantages in their lives as they do not  know respect an opposite sexer, and  perform  perfect teamwork. So,  all in all, co-education out-weights single-sex education.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, the education system has become more advanced than ever before. Parents have now a variety of choices to opt for dispatching their children to get an education. However, it is generally argued that the duo-sex schooling system is better than the solo-sex system. I couldn't agree more with this notion and in the following paragraphs, I would shed light on reasons to support my stance with examples. \n\nTo commence with this perspective, there are myriad things to be shared in its favour. First and foremost, a similar-sex schooling network does not build an appealing personality. Unlike combined-educational tuitions, in such types of institutions, students do not meet and sit with opposite sexes to study with, for example, females. They are not able to interact and spend a lot of time with them until they graduate and as a result, they lack communication skills as well as do not have strong personality traits, for instance, body language. \n\nMoreover, children who study in same-gender colleges throughout their lives are most likely to end up with higher stress. Due to similar kinds of pupils, they are unable to find their life partners who have similar interests and hobbies and they cannot be with someone whom they think is the best one to share their feelings with and get married with. Therefore, they start feeling depressed, less confident and become more introverted. \n\nOn the contrary, solo-gender schools, force schoolgoers to have a great focus on their studies. Most of these students are the ones who achieve their ambitions in life and become capable enough to reach the peak of their professional careers because they are less likely to indulge in different social activities and distract by communal gatherings, for example, bachelor's parties. Therefore, their first priority is to combine studies and make strong links with their buddies who assist them in future in finding jobs. \n\nIn conclusion, it is commonly opined that opposite-sex institutions are better than similar gender ones . I completely agree with this statement because they not only improve their personalities but succour them in searching for their ultimate life partners.",

    "essay": "In the modern society, while some people prefer sending their toddlers to co-institutes or schools where they could find students in same gender, others believe that it would have more drawbacks to the future of a child. I totally disagree with the first half of parents and strongly agree with the latter part.\n\nFirstly, if I would say why I disagree with parents who are willing to send their children to one-sex schools or co-educational institutions, because the unavailability to interact with the opposite gender in childhood may cause some bad effects in the future; moreover, that could be lead to defeat all the goals and expectations too. For example, when a girl grew up and became young, if she has not ever co-op with a peer boy, perhaps she will tend to think that the first boy she meets is the best person in the world and a hero; however, it does not the reality. She will be cheated by him easily and he will be able to drag her life into a pathentic situation. Therefore using single sex schools or co-educational schools will not be a good decision to be taken by parents. \n\nOn the other hand, a part of our society think that there would have many drawbacks of keeping their toddler in a single sex college to his or her future endeavours. I strongly agree with them because I always believe that companions should not be in the same gender. For instance, whenever the both boys and girls are in a same classroom the competition among them will be improved inevitably and it will be encouraged both types of gangs to do their studies hard. In a single sex school there is no allure like that.\n\nTo sum up, it is clearly described why I totally accept  parents who believe unisex schools are the best and who think otherwise there will be have more drawbacks.",

    "essay": "Education is the tool for a better future. While, some say that studying in a single gender school poses certain drawbacks to the students in their life ahead, I believe, so does a coeducational system has. This essay shall intend to explore the merits and demerit of both the approaches to reach a conclusion.\n\nTo begin with, an advantage that common educational institutes offer is that the genders may benefit each other in overall academic progress. To exemplify, boys can assist girls in enhancing their sports skill, whereas the latter may help the former in studies. Additionally, by studying together they inculcate the ethics to greet, respect, and talk. Consequently, this might happen, when children, at puberty, may feel attracted to the other gender, as a result of which, they may get distracted from their studies. Ultimately, hampering their own curricular growth.\n\nOn the other hand, the major advantage of going to a single sex school is that they may have better concentration in studies. The reason being the absence of male or females. They may not hesitate to clarify their doubts without thinking about their impression on opposite sexes. For example, it is observed such schools have a high percentage of students, who pass their matriculation exams in comparison to the co-ed schools. However, they may suffer in future regarding, not being comfortable talking or working with the opposite sex, but slowly this problem could diminish with more exposure.\n\nIn conclusion, each of the system of schooling has advantages like: better scores, learning ethics, being confident, and disadvantages: fascination towards other gender, uncomfortable to work. Nevertheless, I think what should be important is education, these small problems can be overcome with parental guidance and with time.",

    "essay": "Many divergent views exist on the relevance of educating children in a co-education school. A great number of people, including myself, are of the opinion that children will face many obstacles later in their life if their parents continue to send their children into single-sex schools. In this essay, I will provide the rationale for my viewpoint on the matter.\n\nThe Primary effect on restricting children to only attend single-sex schools is that they will not able to acquire important interpersonal skills to interact with another gender. It goes without saying that when both girls and boys graduate from a university or school, they will be working in their corresponding field of study with another gender. The earlier they know how to behave with another gender, the more they will be able to coordinate and feel comfortable with each other later in their life. My friend, Tina, is a shining example of this. Tina, who was not allowed to communicate with male students during the high-school years because of her family tradition, faced many difficulties in academic life during her tertiary education. Before she knew it, she found very difficult to interact with boys for help in assignments and projects compared to average students.\n\nNot only do children improve their soft skills, but it also hinders the opportunity to create a social bond with another gender. Many boys develop a good relationship with girls during their school years, and this allows them to understand another genderâs personality, feelings, and thoughts, vice versa. By restricting this formation at the early age of their life will create problems in their life when they need to know about another gender for their marriage life. Unsurprisingly, a 2007 study conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Toronto found that those students who had mixed-gender classrooms during their education period have a 90% less divorce rate compared to those students who only had education with similar gender. This is because they are able to understand each otherâs opinions, likes, and dislikes.\n\nTo sum up, I hold to the opinion that there are many negative points of sending children to the same sex-school. It is my sincere wish that parents should be more open-minded and they should send their children to mix gender schools where their children can acquire many necessary skills that help them in their future.",

In my view, effective educations in an educational institution prepare you for a better future and getting professional qualifications.\n\nTo begin with, applying for prestigious establishments can assist citizens to achieve their ambitions and give them the best chances to improve their knowledge  because  it has well-known professors  who have professional experience and can help the community to become successful. For example, when people have gone to an academy, they have developed  practical communication skills, time management and leadership which can influence  their future lives. In my opinion, going to top universities provide students with  comprehensive training that we cannot find  in any place. Consequently, becoming more successful in life can result in effective teaching in universities.\n\nOn the other hand, getting experience or doing something you like can help you become professional rather than having academic degrees. Sometimes individuals pursue their ambitions or learn some skills that they want, and these goals can persuade them to become successful. For instance, C. Ronaldo is  one of the best soccer players in the world that does not have any academic degrees, and just he has endless effort.

Education is one of the important factors contributing to successful careers. However, many argue that education has become less important nowadays. In my opinion, it depends on the jobs and passion of each individual.\n\nSome jobs require a special degree from a university to be allowed to provide services to customers.

With the surge of the internet and social media sites, online shopping is one of the methods that has turned a lot of individuals into successful businesses. Although  in order to do this, it is not essential to have high education, it requires hard-working, creativity, and an appropriate set of skills to succeed.\n\nIn conclusion, even though people might see that university education having less important these days, I believe that it is still an essential part of individuals who want to pursue a professional career in particular fields, such as doctors, engineers, and architects.",

    "essay": "A university is a place where âpebbles are polished, diamonds are dimmedâ itself signifies the importance of an educational institution. Some segments of society reckon that a university qualification should mandatory to get success in life; however, counterparts of the society insist that it would not be long lasting benefits to succeed in life. Though both have their pros and cons as per everyoneâs perspectives. Therefore, before commenting on my decision, both opinions would be discussed.\n\nTo embark on, there is no doubt for some people who preferred to join college. Firstly, they believe that it would not only help to get a degree certificate but also there is an opportunity to have internships in the different organisations and, as a result, it would be helped people to expand their skills and knowledge such as communication skills, practical and theoretical knowledge. For instance, various studies conducted in the USA confirmed that seventy per cent of individuals got their desired job by completing their higher degrees in reputed institutions. The more qualifications from universities, the successful life is.\n\nWhy academy degrees are not important things to become successful? The underlying reason behind this is that getting experience and doing something that we like can help us to become professional rather than having academic degrees. If a person has higher qualifications but he does not have the ability to endure in his workplace, there is no value in his college study. To further corroborate the above view, an article published in âThe Timesâ- stated that C. Ronald is one of the best soccer players in the world and he does not have academic degrees but just he gave endless efforts to achieve his goal. Thus, such basic hidden talent can lead to an effective state of life.\n\nIn conclusion, although there are several benefits to acquiring academic degrees from universities, I would say that the best way to become successful in life is to give our best and pursue our ambitions. That is why I opine that the advantages of having knowledge and skills are clearly outweighed by having academy degrees.",

    "essay": "People frequently discuss how education and bad behaviour are linked. Several studies suggest that if someone lacks education, they might be more likely to do incorrect things. This has led people to believe that teaching those in prison can prevent them from committing crimes again after they are released. However, I disagree with this idea. This upcoming article will share my viewpoint prior to reaching a conclusion. \n\nPrimarily, one main reason for the belief that education can reduce lawlessness is that getting a good education can lead to better job opportunities. Nevertheless, things do not always go as planned. Let us consider John as an example, a fictional person who spent time in prison. He learned a lot while behind bars, even earning a certificate in computer programming. Consequently, when he tried to find a job after his release, people still saw him as someone who caused trouble because of his past. Hence, education alone may not change how people view those who have been in trouble previously, making it hard for them to fit back into regular life. \n\nMoreover, while education can help with several issues, it cannot solve everything. Research shows that misdemeanour has numerous reasons, like not having an abundance of money, growing up in a difficult family, or struggling with personal problems. For instance, a study from the National Institute of Justice found that numerous people who go back to committing crimes after jail have problems with drugs or their emotions. Thus, only teaching them might not be enough to stop them from going back to felonies. We need to consider the bigger picture and provide help with other things too. \n\nTo sum up, although teaching people behind bars might sound like a good idea, it might not be the only solution. Education can offer opportunities; on the contrary, it cannot promise success for those who have had problems previously. Therefore, in my opinion, providing education might not be helpful since crime has various reasons, like money, family, and feelings, beyond merely.",

    "essay": "Researches illustrate that many felons have a low level of education. Therefore, individuals think that the better method to minimize crime is to educate people in jail so they can get a job when leave jail. I totally agree with this statement because putting criminals behind bars can bring many benefits inclduing, deterrence, and rehabilitation offenders. \n\nTo begin with, I completely believe keeping criminals in imprisonment can bring many advantages .  To begin , prison sentence  is the effective way to mitigate the rate of crime in community. This is because prison sentence deter other people to turn for crime, which this can make people think twice before enganging in illegal behaviour. In addition, prison is a better opportunity for the governments to educate offenders about what right and wrong. For example, the government can organize educational campaigns in prison in order to teach criminals moral values. As a result, raising awareness among felons  can make criminals a good citizens when they release .\n\nFurthermore, in prison authority can provide education and vocotional training for criminals.  For instance, the authority in prison can allow criminals to complete their study in university or school, which this can contribute to help criminals to improve themselves. Consequntly, when the offenders releases they will are more likely to get a better job opportunity because they have enough education and skills. \n\nTo sum up, I strongly believe prison sentence is efficient method to alleviate rate of crime in society because it bring many  benefits namely, deter other people to commit crime , and rehabilitation of criminals to become a good citizens and help them to find a better professional life.",

    "essay": "In this modern era, an increasing crime rates in every corner of the world. Studies show prisoners who are involved in criminal activities, most of them are a background of low-level education. However, some people concur that the best way to prevent  crime is to conduct special education inside prison. Therefore, they can easily land  a job after release. I tend to stand with the given statement and elaborate more details in the forthcoming paragraph.\n\nFirst of all, even after severe punishment of prisoners, they are involving criminal activities again after being released from  jail due to a lack of job opportunities. To fulfil the basic necessity, they don't have other alternative ideas to gain  money. Therefore, conduct a special education in prison, they can gain more knowledge about the subject which increases the chance of jobs after being released from  jail which indirectly reduces the crime rates. In addition, the government also help prisoners to create  job opportunities. For instance, Robert Dawe who is a famous actor in the current generation, before coming into the profession,  committed a lot of criminal activities. After ,conduct a special education, to a got a job in the film industry.\n\nIn India, for instance, there some educational programmes  are formulated to reintegrate the criminals back to society which was hugely successful. Thus, educating the offenders could bring a bright future for them.Moreover, usually, those who committed crimes  experience  difficulties to find a work, the hardship can be doubled when they illiterate.\n\nIn conclusion, assisting to get enrolled in school or college by culprits can make a dramatic change in their life. In my opinion, this is a great idea as this could dwindling number of re-offenders and a peaceful future for ex-convicts. It is vitally important to educate those who have been sentenced.",

    "essay": "In the salad days of the millennium, it has been proven that illiteracy is the major contributing factor behind the increased number of crimes. However, it is generally believed that the most suitable method to cut down the crime rate is to provide criminals schooling behind bars so they are able to get a good job after they get free. Nonetheless, I partially agree with this notion and in the following paragraphs, I would shed light on numerous reasons to support my stance.\n\nTo commence with the facet of agreement, there are myriad things to be shared in its favour. First and foremost, it is easier to get people learnt in the prison. For example, offenders are highly motivated and inspired to grasp knowledge when they see a large group of folks doing the same thing. In addition to this, giving group tuition is more feasible and convenient for the authorities as compared to  individual teaching sessions. Moreover, criminals have enough time to focus on their studies. They do not have anything important to do during the whole day and usually are free most of the time. Therefore, they can be taught nimbly.\n\nShifting towards the second school of thought, several other measures can be taken to tackle this issue. Different awareness and training sessions are one of those solutions. For instance, if dwellers are provided free educational programs through various platforms such as government websites, they have wider access to get schooling from these podiums at any moment and they are more educated and mature enough to obey the rules. Furthermore, decreased education price is another factor. Keeping schooling economical makes everyone afford it. As a result of this, the count of literate individuals are greater as compared to criminals. Thus, residents are always busy getting an education rather than committing misconduct. \n\nIn conclusion, it is commonly opined that educating offenders in jail is the perfect tactic to cope with the elevated rate of offences in the community because it offers work opportunities to people once they get released. I partially support this perspective because other procedures can also be adopted to combat this problem.",

    "essay": "Based on statistical data illustrating that the deficient literation is highly related to the high unlawful acts.  A significant number of individuals  regard that the pathway to cut down  these acts is  investing in the apprenticeship of  convicts in jails so that are inserted in the work environment upon out. Personally, I agree with the view since it rehabilitates them. Albeit, other overhauls have shown that a plethora of them remains  psychological unaltered. This essay will shed light on both sides of the view  and provide evidence to prove the arguments.\n\nOn the one hand,  outlaws' education glosses over them to fall into  recidivism. In other words,  the training process  makes them up to  real-life  and prevent the practice of new crimes. For instance,  the new research carried out by the University of Oxford pointed out that  four-fifth of defendants  skilled in civic education were straightforwardly  employed after  penal jail . As a result, communities were safe and the local ruling power shrank the national budget allocated to prisons. Moreover, the measure  is fashionable throughout the privileged nations.\n\nOn the other hand, prisons' psychological behaviour is found it hardship to be influenced.  Because of the high sense of madness and dizziness, authorities find  strong withstand when addressing them.  For example,  there are discouraging  data  from a myriad of investigation entities  showing that solely a quarter of  imprisoned worldwide do not fall into recidivism when well-educated. Hence,  investing public funds  into the criminals  is a financial resource squandering that the folk has to pay.\n\nIn conclusion, notwithstanding a sort of reluctance from the bandits, this is the most upbeat and effective following  to insert them into  the world society.Therefore, I still agree with the statement. In addition, I recommend the planetary world regime implement the measure  for safety,  peace and economic growth on the earth.",

    "essay": "One of the popular opinions prevailing ubiquitously in the current society is that educating people in prison could reduce the crimes committed. In this essay, I will discuss the merits of the notion and present my opinion.\n\nFirstly, it is true to a great extent that the citizens who commit crimes are under-educated. Because of this lack of education, people find it difficult to estimate the legal and moral consequences of their actions which oftentimes is a danger to fellow innocent people. Therefore, giving proper education to a person in prison that lead to career opportunities after being released allows them to live a comfortable life without having to resort to unlawful actions. For example, according to a recent article published in the local newspaper; an ex-convict started a small business with the help of the knowledge he possessed during his prison time. Hence, education can definitely turn convicted criminals into model citizens.\n\nWhile education can be a contributing factor to turning any individual into a responsible person that lives within the confines of the law, it is not the only way. In addition to educating prisoners, finding the root cause of the problem by conducting research on the aspects like reasons as to why many commit crimes which is a wide spectrum of issues. This gives society an opportunity to eliminate the problem before it even happens. \n\nIn conclusion ,however, I believe that educating convicted people in a correctional facility does outweigh other ways to reduce crimes being committed.

    "essay": "How to reduce crime efficiently is still a headache problem of every government across the world until now. There have been countless theories proposed by experts and professors to tackle this ever-increasing issue. One of them is implementing an education system in prison. Some people think it is unnecessary to spend the national revenue on this issue, nevertheless, I fully agree with this statement by following supporting ideas.\n\nIn reality, some countries have processed polytechnic education in prison. The authority invites tutors to teach criminals hands-on skills, such as handmade desserts and furniture, to make the prison profitable. These products are also welcome among civilians. On one hand, these prisons do not have to rely on the grant supported by the government. On the other hand, this win-win strategy can force criminals to focus on their production activity to reduce violent activities in prison.\n\nSecondly, the main reason of being brought to prison, according to some researches, is that most criminal comes from the bottom of the society, they do not have opportunity to accept normal education and learn specific skills to acquire an occupation, therefore they have to put them in risk to commit crimes, namely theft and robber, to make ends meet and put food on the table for their family. These criminals can adapt the society rules and start a new page in their lives after releasing throughout re-education in prison. This policy not only makes them more adoptable by folks, but also be a productive workforce in the community.\n\nIn conclusion, although education in prison is not a superpower treatment for reducing crime, I believe that criminalsâ spirit and mental can be refreshed by integrating education to make them learn variable skills to adapt the world after releasing, meanwhile it can relieve the societyâs burden.",

    "essay": "The world we are living in is, unfortunately, facing loads of serious environmental problems. There is an idea that says if we want to solve these problems, the best way is to increase the cost of petrol. Although I agree that we must deal with environmental issues, I do not think the mentioned solution is a smart choice.\n\nFirstly, the rise in fuel price is likely to be counter-intuitive because it would put a lot of burden on the economy. Everyone would be affected, from workers whose companies are far away from their homes, or parents who have to travel long distances to take their children to school, to a stressed person who just wants to go somewhere outside to relax. Businesses would have to pay much more for delivery, and some would even close down because of losses. If this happened for a long time, it would lead to an economic crisis.\n\nInstead, I believe that a much better solution would be to boost researches into and manufacture of vehicles that use clean energy. Gasoline cost might go up, but that would not reduce peopleâs need for travelling. Therefore, we need to give them other options instead of forcing them to give up their only choice. Electric motorbikes and cars are the kinds of vehicles we can take into consideration. In fact, these have become very popular with people in my country, Vietnam, during recent years. This could be more successful when we can mass produce these means of transport and make them more affordable. \n\nIn conclusion, I do not agree with the idea that raising fuel cost is the best solution to environmental problems because this will make matters worse by damaging the economy. Rather than that, we should focus on researching and producing vehicles using clean energy.",

    "essay": "The pollution of the environment has become the most often discussed topic in recent years. While it is true that motor vehicle fume has been a major contributor to this global issue, I donât agree with the notion that increasing the price of fuel for land vehicles would solve this problem. This essay will discuss  the adverse effects of such a solution and a more effective way to curb vehicle fumes. \n\nIt is not a wise move to increase fuel prices as cars and other vehicles are not the only polluters. Factories and other machinery used in industries emit more greenhouse gasses. Even agricultural methods can harm the environment significantly, which can be seen in the Netherlands where a high level of Nitrous Oxide is released causing concerns of the European Commission. Moreover, increasing the price of fuel will increase the cost of living with increased transport costs of consumer articles and the cost of motor car users. We can see staggering inflation rates in Europe with the mere short supply of fuels due to the Ukraine-Russian war. \n\nA Better Alternative to curb the emissions of carbon by motor vehicles is to facilitate the use of electric cars. It is obvious that electric vehicles emit virtually nothing and nor do they contribute to noise pollution. These cars, for example, are charged with solar-powered charging stations and therefore the electricity used to charge the car batteries use clean energy. The effect will be enormous and therefore, governments need to provide more subsidies to the buyers of such vehicles to encourage this useful technology. \n\nIn conclusion, while agreeing on the pollution caused by motor vehicles, I do not agree an increase in fuel prices for them would be a prudent solution thereto. What the government should do is  provide subsidies to purchase electric vehicles.",

    "essay": "Some people think the best way to solve the global environmental problem is to raise the fuel cost for vehicles. In my opinion, I agree with this point of view.\n\nOn the one hand, most of the problems causing environmental pollution often stem from the problems of vehicle emissions into the environment. Nowadays, the use of private vehicles or public transport is a way to help people easily move between places. Many vehicles use tension or oil to move, which has created a large number of emissions that are released into the environment and pollute the air. For example, in Ho Chi Minh City every morning, there are a lot of vehicles moving on the roads causing traffic congestion, making the outside air temperature rise, and being heavily polluted by smog caused by vehicles discharged.\n\nHowever, there are some solutions that the government can apply to reduce environmental pollution such as increasing the fuel cost of vehicles. Increasing fuel prices causes a lot of problems for people but it will be the best solution to limit traffic.

This will help reduce emissions to the environment and ensure the cleanest possible air from vehicles. It helps promote people to use clean energy sources. Renewable sources such as wind, solar and nuclear are also very good at solving environmental problems.\n\nIn conclusion, fueling vehicle is the best solution for the government to minimize environmental pollution.",

In some areas, the governments adjust the number of vehicles by increasing the fuel price, while I firmly disagree because this route could give more back draws than benefits.\n\nOn the one hand, it undoubtedly agrees that increasing the cost of fuel may reduce the traffic travelers as well as the depletion of oil resources and air pollution. Those, who have the average salary or be in poverty, will consider the fuel segment from the total personal expenditure than those who belong to top-notch. These groups may mitigate the expenses by transforming public transportation instead of personal mobility. This method is a considerable short-term measure to work on air qualification.\n\nOn the other hand, the convenience of traveling by own cars or vehicles is not demolished even with the growth of public transportation. Residents might go by foot in some distance to catch the bus or train. In the addition, how to shorten the time to travel is more likely their priority in long term. Moreover, rising the cost of conventional fuels could imbalance the market by rising the other materials simultaneously. This leads to a more crucially serious which is called inflation spiralled out of control which may mitigate life condition standards. To illustrate, the cost of fuel reached a new peak in most countries in the year 2022 and has attacked many aspects of human life such as the higher food from agriculture logistics, the health condition of hospitals, the construction materials, and so on. \n\nIn conclusion, I exposed that the market is the chain of many categories connection, and the higher price of fuel should be the reason for many otherâs surges. Governments around the world should aware of both the methodsâ merits before filing them.",

    "essay": "Some people believe the most effective reform to mitigate environmental issues is to increase fuel prices for vehicles. In my opinion, while this is necessary for the short-term, education acts as the priority solution.\n\nThose who advocate the need for the increased cost of fuel often point to the immediate effect on the environment. People are often driven by costs so more expensive fuel prices can discourage them to commute with their vehicles, creating the demand for public transport. For example, Vietnam has been experiencing a rise in fuel for the past 3 months, and the locals are making the transition from private cars and motorbikes to bicycles and electric buses. Accordingly, this has resulted in a cleaner atmosphere and fresher air in big cities like Hanoi and Saigon. However, officials doubt the effectiveness of this approach because the rise has caused a lot of frustration for the citizenry. \n\nThis is why I consider fuel increases can help improve the worsening environment for only a short period of time. A better solution calls for the urge to educate people about the long-term impact. Human activities have long been blamed for damaging the environment and there are many factors contributing to this. Toxic gases released by vehicles only account for part of the cause, while large-scale industries, deforestation and unsustainable farming are also the catalysts. If people were aware of the consequences that they made while operating in their fields, the environment would not suffer as it does now. Maybe instead of cutting down trees for residential housing, city planners can be more thoughtful by creating more green spaces for residents to live close to nature.\n\nIn conclusion, increased prices for fuel can somewhat prevent people from using their vehicles for a limited time, but we need to work towards long-term reform. I think once we educate people to be more responsible in their areas, we already help the environment not to be seriously harmed.",

    "essay": "In order to solve environmental problems, governments in the world have been seeking various methods. Some people suggest that increasing the cost of fuel for cars is the best way. I admit that it certainly can give an advantage of environmental protection. However, this way is also followed by some drawbacks and more efficient and effective ways should be adopted.\n\nOn the one hand, the elevated fuel price can reduce the use and purchases of private cars. Due to the high cost, people are willing to choose public transportation like buses or subways when they go out, which greatly decreases their carbon footprint. Furthermore,  some people who have plans to buy a new car,  are likely to consider hybrid cars or electric vehicles as a better choice as a result of cost-efficiency. As a consequence, the use and the purchases of gas-powered cars all  present downward trends, which therefore yields many benefits to the environment.\n\nOn the other hand, I am not in the support of the perspective that raising fuel prices is the best way. Because of the policy, many fuel companies tend to exploit more fossil fuels like oil for high profits, which leads to  dire damage to the environment, So, more efficient ways should be taken into consideration. For instance, governments should explore alternative energies via developing solar energy or building up offshore wind farms and increase peopleâs environmental awareness through  public signs. Only by taking these measures together can we solve environmental problems in a better way \n\nIn conclusion, increasing the fuel cost will be conducive to protecting the environment. But just doing so is not enough and more measures should be explored and adopted.",

From my perspective, I am in favour of this opinion, believing that not only should enterprises and entrepreneurs aim to make a profit but take more duties into consideration.\n\nLiving in a world full of competitiveness and stress, there is no doubt that businessmen and corporations make an effort to earn as much money as they could, thus gaining an edge over competitors. For instance, Apple's company endeavours to lower the manufacturing cost and increase the sale price so that it can reap more revenue from the market. As a result, all interested parties, such as shareholders, governments and so on, can benefit from it. Furthermore, profit-driven pursuits could fuel people and enterprises to make progress through unremitting effort, because wealth is able to make many dreams come true.

In my opinion, I agree with this statement as corporate gain money from society, therefore it should also returned back it to society.\n\nFirst of all, firms should not exploit their employees. This is because some businesses will exploit their workers by forcing them to work long hours that exceed the maximum working hours. Furthermore, some firms do not pay the minimum wage requirement in order to keep their costs as low as possible. Additionally, some firms are not providing any insurance care for their employees. Although the result may end up by making huge profits, however, the entire process is considered inhumanity. Therefore, corporate social responsibility is essential as it protects the legal rights of employees.\n\nBesides, profits created by companies should give some portion back to society. This is due to the fact that all the resources needed by firms come from society. For instance, if a firm wants to produce a product, they need natural resources, capital, and human resources. The businesses pick up the natural resources that belong to everyone in the world. The businesses capital mostly are  sponsor or charity by the individuals. The ventures also need the demand of labor force that provide by the households. If a firm did not have social responsibilities, it might be abandoned by society.

I completely agree with this opinion due to the fact that a business's survival requires the support of the stakeholders.\n\nAccruing profits should not be the only goal of any investor. The reason is that there are many stakeholders in any investment and this range from shareholders to employees to local communities hosting the business to customers. Therefore, a business owner has large responsibility of satisfying these stakeholders. Though the primary aim of shareholders is to make gains, however, the hosting land will expect some positive impacts from the business. For example, an oil mining company is expected to contribute to the growth of its local community by achieving less pollution in the environment and also providing some social amenities in order to continue enjoying the support of the local community. Therefore, as an investor is trying to make money to satisfy the shareholders, he also needs to work hard to maintain strong support from the local community.\n\nFurthermore, a business owner also has a responsibility to customers. Customers consume the products and their aspirations need to be met. Customers can be grouped into two. There are retailers and final consumers. For instance, farmers in Australia supply to retail outlets for onward selling to final consumers or they sell directly to consumers. Therefore, a business owner must maintain a strong relationship with these groups, by making sure He is supplying quality products at affordable prices. This will make the business sustainable for its shareholders for continuous returns.\n\nIn conclusion, as much as businesses must make profits, social responsibilities cannot be avoided if a business will survive for a long period of time.

I completely agree with this idea because it can make an index to measure a healthy socioeconomic.\n\nOn the one hand, the main target of each company in the business area is making money, which inherently plays a critical role in society. If a company has succeeded in making a profit, it generally needs to grow and improve, which means more job positions for new employees, more indirect jobs, and more money for other businesses that are related to that company. Consequently, the level of poverty will decrease, the economy will be more dynamic, and society will be healthier psychologically because of the money that is on moving between people. It seems that the business leads to various solutions for a part of  social problems, and if it can make money, society is unlikely to face such difficulties.\n\nOn the other hand, businesses have social responsibilities to other parts of society that are impacted by them, but they are not inherently responsible for them. A big company that has chosen a small city to make its factory, which is routine in companies because they want a decline in their costs, can be a good example of how business can impact on society. But this decision can have detrimental effects on local people. Migrating new workers from other areas, using infrastructural facilities like hospitals or schools by that migrated workers, and disappearing traditional cultures because of communication that local people make with such workers are some instances of such effects.

In my opinion, though there are strong economic reasons to support this idea, university education holds greater value.\n\nThose in favour of more practical skills training point out the financial benefits. Most university graduates are burdened with student debt and face uncertain job prospects. In contrast, training schools are cheap, fast, and ease students into steady employment immediately. The jobs they train for are also most likely recession-proof and durable, including positions as cooks, hotel managers, and skilled technicians. Someone who is firmly established in such a job in their early 20s does not have to deal with the pressure associated with university life and its incumbent debts. Instead, they can begin to set aside money for a house or start a family.\n\nNonetheless, lacking a university degree limit one's options. The jobs available will pay well initially and be secure, but offer narrow scope for advancement and virtually no opportunity to switch the career paths. An individual with a university degree, on the other hand, might begin from a lower position, but has a higher ceiling on future earnings. It is also possible for them to explore a variety of fields. Most good jobs require at least a bachelorâs degree even for simple internship vacancies. Lacking such a degree, means restricting oneself to manual labour or service industry jobs. The actual learning that takes place at university, particularly for those with multi skills majors or studying at liberal art schools, also encourages students to consider a wide range of possible career options.\n\nIn conclusion, increasing funding for vocational training is an attractive yet short sighted approach that curbs possibilities.

In my point of view, the promotions do wonders for both customers and business. \n\nWhile the redeeming features of advertisements are widely acknowledged, it is unfair if its drawbacks are ignored. With a drastic increase in  technology devices, advertising is easier for everyone. There is a wealth of low quality products promoted widenly on social media such as Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, which leads to plenty of alarming conditions .Remarkably is the cream named mixed-cream,which is unknown origin and ingredient, can be cited as an outstanding instance. Despite its latent serious dangers such as bad skin condition, or health condition, it still widely sells because of its high coverage advertising effect. That leads to a counterpart of the advertisement industry on people, who have strong trust on promotion. Thus, untruly promotion can cause a great deal of urgent impact on customers.\n\nIn conclusion, while the advantage of advertisement is proved crealy, it still does great damage to people because of its counterpart mentioned.",

    "prompt": "Advertisements are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Is it a positive or negative development?",
    "essay": "The developments of mass media have led to the popularity of advertising. Personally, I believe this phenomenon has both beneficial and detrimental sides.\n\nThere are two main benefits of advertisements that I can point out. Firstly, the existing and newly-launched products can both be promoted. Thanks to advertisements, the goods will be widely recognized and earn a reputation through many forms such as commercials, billboards, endorsements, etc... To illustrate the point, the tech giant Apple has successfully applied the posters to advertise their brand new iPhone 13 series products and gained a higher profit by 4% than the previous year. Secondly, customers can also benefit from advertisementsâ knowledge. Specifically, commercials can supply all sorts of people with useful information about the goods, for example, regarding healthcare and eating habits. \n\nSimultaneously, there are still some drawbacks that advertisements bring back. Many of advertisers create misleading impressions of their goods. In reality, their items were of inferior quality but the advertisers exaggerated them for their own interests. For instance, Snapchat used to mislead customers into thinking that pictures disappeared forever. Afterwards, the company was also accused by the FTC of collecting customer data. In addition, advertising can also cause a great burden for the companies.  In other words, to be advertised on TV, businesses have to pay for a huge amount of money.\n\nIn conclusion, advertisements can have both  benefits and drawbacks to daily life. From my observation, the companies can advertise for their products but not abuse them.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, advertising is a vital part of modern business which allows entrepreneurs to thrive in the business sphere and to inform customers about their products. Having said that , there are some negative effects of them, as they may distract people from staying concentrated as well as lead more consumerism. \n\nAdvertisements can be presence almost everywhere where people pay attention more or where is more crowded.  When people are watching TV or videos on social media and reading some articles online, there are some breaks which are deliberately for advertisements. Once flashy advertisements appear, people may have to their concentration. As a result, the attention spans of many people may reduce. For instance, it is much harder to teach students than ever before, since they cannot stay focused on certain tasks in longer amount of time. \n\nAdvertising can manipulate adults and particularly children and its purpose is to persuade them purchasing certain product may assist to be more grateful. Usually, after watching those children-oriented advertisements, they might start pestering their parents to buy the products for them. Consequently, this can create consumerism from an early age. Moreover, businessmen normally hire glamorous, successful people in order to promote their company. Therefore, people are encouraged to buy the products that might not need them at all. This may lead more consumerism in some cases. \n\n\tTo sum up, existing more advertisement in our daily life has many negative effects. Hence, people should try to decrease the amount of advertisement on TV as well as on social media. Additionally, advertisements at children should be controlled or even banned.",

    "prompt": "Some people say that the government should stop TV and Newspaper from showing crimes because media coverage of violent crimes is frightening people and encouraging criminals. Do you agree or disagree with the statement?",
    "essay": "With the advancement of technology, we now have access to a variety of tools such as television, the internet, magazines, and newspapers to keep us up to date on global events. And having the breach scenes broadcast is a controversial topic as the violence can be frightening to viewers or encourage people to commit crimes. I'm inclined to agree with the mentioned opinion, but there is another perspective. I will discuss both opinions in the essay with suitable examples. On the one hand, human psychology is vulnerable to the brutality shown in programs. To begin with, the violence often frightens the viewers and affects their peace of mind. For example, the elderly feel depressed and scared after watching an episode of a story containing murder and robbery. Furthermore, if the criminal had read the detailed description in the newspaper, they would have had the idea to commit a crime against the local authorities. Therefore, the government should impose a restriction on broadcasting such brutal acts. On the other hand, some people believe that a clear, informative message is delivered to the young generation through these criminal reports. The heinous consequences of wrongdoing remind them of the critical importance of not engaging in any offense, such as drug or alcohol abuse. Moreover, many cases broadcast on TV have been explained in crime coverage, which allows viewers to know more about the criminal. Through this, they can protect themselves as well as their loved ones. In conclusion, the violence presented through any mass media has both a positive and negative influence on society. From my point of view, the prohibition on such media coverage does not serve the purpose, though some filters can be applied to make it more effective for people absorbing the information.",

    "essay": "In recent times, technological advancements have become booming every single day. It is believed by some that in the modern world more and more people are becoming reliant on each other while others argue that they have become more independent; I take the view with the latter notion. This essay will discuss both sides and provides support for the writerâs opinion.\n\nOn the one hand, there are those who firmly believe that these days people are relying on one another more than ever. They assume that with the accelerating rate of modernization, people will not be able to keep up with the latest electronic gadgets such as computers or cell phones. Take an illiterate person for example, it will be challenging for him to utilize his phone to contact family members and be in touch with them. In addition, when he tends to leave home and finds a way to a place where he has never been   since he cannot use mobile apps like Waze or Google Maps, he might end up getting lost and find himself in the middle of nowhere.\n\nOn the other hand, there are those who opine that humans are living in the most independent era in  history. They are deeply engaged with technology and make a determined effort to get the best out of it. This means by allocating more  home appliances such as washing machines, Food processors and blenders those who are in charge of doing the housework spend a minimum amount of time getting over  these tasks. Moreover, in terms of shopping, it is no longer necessary to get prepared and spend time shopping for clothes and groceries in high streets; that is due to the fact that one can take on the responsibility by simply pushing the buttons on his personal computer or cell phone. Therefore I honestly believe being independent is not far-fetched in today's world.\n\nTo sum up, although there are still people outside who rely on others to help with their duties and activities, I personally have a firm conviction that the globe is facing the most independent period of all time do the conveniences technology has brought us.",

Many  are believe we are dependent on each other on the other hand some people think we are more independent. This essay will explore both sides of this term.Firstly, i will discuss  why we are still now depedent on each other and secondly, some independent things discussion.\n\nIn socity humans are very much dependent on many natural and artificial elements. it is so common in this era. There are lots of reasons why ethnic group are dependent. First of all, they are not able to do everything. Like some countries  produce vegetable and fruits in a big number and they heve enough for survive so that these country export these kinds of things. They import fruits and vegetable because they are unable ti produce. Also we get various kinds of help from other human. For instance, fisherman catch the fish and they sold it on market, we bought it by money. By doing this kinds of things both groups altemately get the benifit. Money is imprtant for fisherman and fish is necessary for other profession people.\n\nOn the other hand, a good number of people believe nowdays humans are more independent. It is also true for many examples. At this moment, technology is a big factor of our daily life. We did lots of work by this. Even some technology works like a human. Such as Roboot. Roboot can did some particular work like humans. In term of food, people are able to produce vegetable and fruits by using other countries soil. Another things is at present people are more self dependent and powerful for some technology.  As well as, majority of governments in world give free access and permission for any work or travel.For example, few years ago economically humans are very much dependent on rich people but nowdays the do job and earn money freedomly.\n\nIn conclusion, in this stage of gllobalaization sometimes people dependent on large number of sources which source handle by people, at the same time, there is a lots of sector that which are totally free.

    "essay": "While some believe that modernisation has made us more reliant on each other, others, however, think that we are more self-reliant and free from dependency on others as time has progressed. I believe that we have become more independent than at any time in history.\n\nPeople who advocate that we have become more dependent on each other in this modern era often present the idea that our necessity has increased and we need to interact with far more people due to this. This in a way requires us to rely on others for our needs. For instance, office executives mostly rely on laundry services, restaurants, housemaids, cleaning services and so on to have their necessary works done. In the past, people used to do most of these tasks on their own. Moreover, the prices of education, house, daily commodities etc. are skyrocketing day by day and we need to rely on our parents to have those needs fulfilled until we get a job. When we will become earning members, our parents and children will rely on us. Due to peopleâs busy schedules and high ambitions, they need to socialise and get to know people from different walks of life and this creates a wider circle in which peopleâs interaction and reliance on each other increase.\n\nHowever, I would agree with the people who opine that modernization has made us free and less reliant on others. In most countries, young children are trying to support their education and living costs. After a certain age, they prefer to stay own their own house. The number of nuclear and single-parent families proves that people are less reliant on others. We are free to pick the school, travel to other countries and make our choices for most of the major events in our life including picking our life partners. The progress of technology has made us more self-reliant and we love to take advantage of modern tools and devices to make things of our own. For instance, many people these days pick an online lesson than getting admitted to a training institute. Many of us even have the freedom to work from home and this is a paradigm shift in the way we earn our living. Finally, the gender equality and women empowerment movements have greatly made women free from others reliance and self-dependent and this has all been possible only recently.\n\nIn conclusion, though some people think that the modern era is the time when we are more reliant on each other, I personally believe that we are more free and self-reliant instead.",

    "essay": "People have different views about whether we are more dependent on each other. While others believe nowadays people are more independent, i think most of the society is dependent on other society.\n\nOn the one hand, in ancient part public was too much dependent on rich family and landlord but few decades ago the scenery has been changed. In ,past most   humans are illiterate, so that they are very much dependent on the rich class. But at present majority number of the nation are educated. So that they do the job under private companies or government service. In the modern world community's are not dependent but every single provincial dependent on each other. For  example most of the country exported oil from the middle east of the world like Saudi Arab, the UAE, Iran etc. Without export oil from those country others bucolic's are totally immovable, similarly some nation's export electric machine and vehicles from China,Japan,the UK and so on ,Also some first-classclass country sent money and food help to the poor country. So it can be said globally people's are dependent on each other.\n\npublic certainly more independent on their personal life.For example, in first-classclass world like the USA, the UK, China, Japan, and many others European country people are much more independent. They can do anything in their personal life without a break the government role. The main reason for this, most of the homey are independent. So common society is totally free. The rich class community can travel anywhere of the world at the same time they can choose their favourite job. Their children are also easygoing. \n\nIn conclusion, most of the country are dependent on each other but the majority portion of people are independent in their personal life.",

I completely disagree with that statement and believe that we are more independent today, because of the strong competition in the working market of the modern world. \n\nOn the one hand, some think that the technological advancements regarding how we communicate today with each other have turned us to be more dependent. Digital communication platforms, such as Whatsup and Telegram, are growing rapidly in popularity and as a consequence most of our activities are being performed oniline with others. For example, in my hospital where I am currently working as a physician, most of the decesions concerning the managment of patients lives are being taken online, by several doctors, together.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe that the will to succeed in our modern world has transformed us to be less dependent. Nowadays, more and more individuals are aiming for more meaningful careers and trying to earn as much money as they can. Due to that sort of competition, people are becoming more independent, in order to gain more success than their rivals. For instance, in my country, fellowships programs in medicine are highly competitive these days. As a result, young doctors are trying to acheive as many awards as they can during their residency, by working alone. \n\nIn conclusion, differing views exist regarding the question of how dependent we are now, compare to how we were in the past.

    "essay": "The interview section is the most vital part of the hiring process. It is the time for knowing the interviewee and also for the person being interviewed to learn some information about the company. But, some people think that interview is not an accurate way of selecting whom to employ. In my opinion, the interview will always be the best way of choosing the right candidate for a certain position in an establishment.\n\nInterviewing is very beneficial not just for hiring but also for other aspects like research or healthcare setting. It is very advantageous because you will know more about your prospect for the specified job. The interviewer will have the chance to ask about the person's background  education, and work experience as well as any injuries that could hinder doing some of the required tasks. For example, a manager could ask about the hobbies of the interviewee, plans for the next 5 years and also related experience for the position he is applying. In this way, the boss will have the chance to know what kind of person will he be working with soon. Furthermore, questioning before hiring will give the person the opportunity to showcase his skills to the head of the department. This is a very crucial part for the person being interviewed because this is the time for him to sell himself to the company. He will be able to inform them of the things that he could offer and share with the company that others can't. For instance, a person could inform the company in chronological order of his experiences that will benefit the company. With this, he will be able to upsell his abilities and knowledge for the job.4\n\nHowever, there are other methods that will help a company choose an employee. One of them is by providing an examination. This will help the employer know the level of knowledge and understanding of a person and hence will be helpful to match to a certain position. But, this will only show the intellectual side of a person ,not the attitude. \n\nTo recapitulate, the interview is the best method to use when selecting staff for an institution. This will not only give you an insight into the person's attitude but also the knowledge and skills that he has. As everyone keeps saying, attitude is very important when hiring  staff because skills and knowledge are learnable.",

For example, if an applicant copies the cv to online and submits it to the company without checking if he is qualified then ruins the operation. \n\nHowever, there are some companies that they will not require for interviews. Low-level jobs, for example, some ordinary work like gardening, cleaner and many more. But a high-level job like a manager and other high-paid jobs must require a professional interview so the company will know if they fit the position. \n\nTo conclude, the interview is the best way to determine if the applicant is good enough for a job posting.

They believe that most   people do not have good communication skills and they lost their jobs due to it,however some people have a huge amount of knowledge and experience.most people have personality traits like honesty and creativity common,nevertheless if companies conduct interviews these traits would not be noticed by organisations.for example, a survey was conducted in 2018, and it showed that 50% of people do not get a job in Tesla company because they do not have good talking experience but have better skills and traits. Consequently,  most humans would get employment if companies focus on  people's behaviour and other skills rather than questionnaires.\n\non the other hand, interviews are also crucial when choosing employees for work because it is a face to face interaction and people have to give  true and fair answers. moreover, quick answers people also do not get a chance to do cheating which would provide a perfect worker for the company.

Although it may be argued that interviews are not a reliable method of selecting a person for a job, I agree with the premise and will substantiate my reasons in the course of this essay.\n\n     The expression \"First impression, is the best impression\" comes to mind here because this is what interviews are basically about. A company gets many applications for any given job requirement. Therefore in order to \"thin out the herd\", firms hold these formal discussions so as to gauge the interviewees. Moreover, this way the interviewer will also be able to assess the technical know-how of the applicant and his expectations. In addition, the temperament of the applicant can be assessed along with his communication level. The communication level is a very important aspect of a job because there may be situations where a potential employee needs to speak to senior-level managers, and if they are unable to convey their message in a simplistic manner, then the message gets lost.\n\n         Furthermore, it is an opportunity for the company to provide a potential employee with their expectations of them, and also through these discussions help them to determine whether the applicant will suit their working environment. Also, through a face to face interview, interviewers can get to know through the body language and facial expressions the exact intent of the applicant. This is very important and cannot be obtained from a resume.\n\n         To conclude, I believe that interviews are important from a company's perspective for obtaining the best employee for their requirement. As they are going to be paying for their services in terms of salaries, it is only fair that they get to see the potential employee and understand their capabilities.",

Some people proposed that an interview is not an authentic source of picking the employees; there are other selection criteria to qualify the candidates. I personally disagree with the notion. \n\nThe first and foremost reason for the disappointment with the idea is that the recruitment of the employees by conducting face-to-face interviews enables the employers to estimate the personal characteristics and sophisticated cognitive skills. For example, verbal testing depicts the communication skills and fluency in the language along with the aptitude and quick response to  emergencies.Thus, the recruitment by verbal testing assures the owner about the potential of the applicant.\n\nMoving further, some of the entrepreneurs use other options to specify the essence of human capital. The first method is written testing which helps employers to conclude the mathematical talent of the workers. Secondly, some of the multinational and international firms use  references to select the helping hands. For instance,in the food industry, most of the owners verify the references. It disseminates more accuracy and transparency as the applicant is familiar with the current working staff.\n\nTo conclude then, it is taxing work to decide which method is perfect for the vacancies.

First I will discuss some arguments supporting my ideas about this statement, after which some aspects against that will be presented.\n\n On the one hand, many people agree with this statement for many noteworthy reasons. The most remarkable is that the recruiters can get an idea about the personalitty and skills of the potential employees .For instance,when the person is asked about any topic and he answers it in a concise and crisp manner,then the recruiter gets to know he is suitable for the job. Another key reason is that if a candidate is asked about case studies then the recruiters can judge the personality traits of that employee and also the ability to think outside the box.\n\nOn the other hand, other people disagree with this statement for many reasons. They believe that other modes of recruiting like written tests and group discussions will help understand the mindset in a better manner.Written tests help in evaluating the technical or theoretical knowlege of a person.\n\nGroup discussions help in getting a grasp of the conversational skills that he/she possesses.For example,in sales and marketing jobs conversational skills play a major role.  \n\n All in all, when all the specific reasons and relevant examples are considered and evaluated,  I strongly  agree with the idea supporting this statement because its benefits outweigh its drawbacks.",

    "essay": "In the contemporary era, every multi-national company recruits its employees by taking face-to-face interviews. Is taking an interview is a convenient method as compared to all other hiring processes? In my perspective, doing so is logically flawed because in terms of better chance to check personâs technicality knowledge and confidence along with his way of speaking.\n\nPrimarily, a recruiter can evaluate the IQ level and the knowledge related to his specific field. The reason behind is that by asking the different type of instant questions such as mathematical problems, Logical reasoning question, various situational scenarios, and so on, thereby, to check the problem-solving skills of the applicant. An MNC named Infosys, for instance, hired 100 students from my college by taking multiple rounds of examination.\n\nBesides checking his brain skills, the intervieweeâs confidence level can be verified. An employer can ask various personal life questions or can arrange group discussion interviews, which means by making group of 4-5 students in one panel, and give any current topic related to any aspect in the world, which is not possible in any kind of other hiring processes. Consequently, the candidates who speak well, and with confidence can be recruited.\n\nMoreover, the applicantâs manner of speaking can be gauge only in a verbal conversation. This is because many jobs required their employees to talk politely with their international clients and national as well; therefore, talking skills can be only judged by taking interviews. For instance, in a call-centre job, every employee has to deal with a number of customers to solve their queries. In that field form of speaking is a must and it should be decent, clear and loud.\n\nIn conclusion, since not only is the better way to check courage and way of communicating of the applicants but also it provides an opportunity to connect with them personally, I am convinced that interviews are the best way to finding any information of the aspirant.",

And recruiters can give an idea of personality and social skills. If the process has done pretty well, it can connect very tight for good.

This method finds the candidates' logical intelligence which a vital for IT companies. Last but not least, there is a combination of three method like, the giving assignment, the written task, and eventually interview.\n\nTo conclude, I'm afraid to disagree that interview is not a trustworthy method for hiring employers.

    "essay": "Issues related to manufacturing effects are frequently discussed these days. It is true that the increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. In the following paragraph, both causes and solutions will be discussed.\n\nOn the one hand, there are a number of causes associated with the growth of manufacturing. The principal cause is that gas and pollution emissions from the producing processes directly result in the atmosphere. In other words, One of the most dangerous consequences of the consumer-making stage is the Greenhouse effect caused by Carbon Dioxide, CFCs, and Methane. For instance, Our stratum temperatures are higher than in the past because of the global warming effect. This dramatically affects climate change as a result of there are polar ice melting, wildfires, and rising seas & coastal flooding.\n\nOn the other hand, there are potential ways to tackle such problems, or at least reduce the effects. One of the possible solutions to this issue is reducing plastic usage volume. This means decreasing the number of using products with plastic packaging which is the main factor of global warming. For example, there is a campaign about preferring cloth bags to plastic bags these days. Other than that, reducing personal car driving is an efficient way to tackle this issue because we can control the gas emissions from vehicles.\n\nAll things considered, It can be concluded that the increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment and we can solve this problem by stopping using products which are harmful to the earth.",

    "essay": "In the present day, the natural environment is inflicted negatively due to the rise of consumer goods manufacture. This essay attempts to identify the causes of this matter and provides a solution for diminishing the consequence to the environment.\n\nThe harm to the environment derives from the companiesâ release of vinegar and the lack of peopleâs awareness. For the former, with the dramatic growth of population, more and more products have been manufactured in order to severe individual purposes in many aspects of life. This act leads to  mass production which requires enterprises to operate at full capacity to satisfy the considerable consumption of billions of people throughout the world. If those businesses are run without stopping to handle chemicals from manufacturing, these tonnes of chemicals, which contain contaminating substances, will be discharged into the rivers and beaches which causes adversely to the water habitat. Furthermore, another cause can be mentioned as the deficiency of residentsâ awareness. Some people hold the view their consumption on clothing, plastic products are not sizeable so they do not need to take action to recycle after using those products for once. For that reason, their waste can be the pollutants to the environment from the processing methods, namely burning which results in  air pollution. For example, it is recorded that around 90 million pieces of garments are thrown away annually across the globe. \n\nBesides that, there is a vital solution which should be taken is to give obsolete things, especially clothing and books to charitable organisations so that they can provide for the needy, such as the minority. Each year, there are parts of people in the mountainous regions who are short of clothing and education. Thus, giving old clothes, and books to charity not only reduce pollution but also helps underprivileged people to have better lives. \n\nIn conclusion, while the removal of vinegar from firms and the lack of awareness are the causes of goods manufacture, utilising obsolete items for charity is what could be done to alleviate the environmental problems.",

    "essay": "By the present, there have been many concerns about the environment negatively affected to by human activities, and one of them is the consumer goods manufacturing. It is essential to argue how this manufacturing has negative impact to the environment and what should be done to restrict this impact. \n\nTo begin with, consumer goods companies are responsible for the pollution. They try their best to reduce expenses to maximize profits. Because dealing with production waste is extravagant for many companies, they decide to skip this activity and emit them into the environment. There are many consequences of this decision to the environment. The majority of companies use fossil fuels as the main energy source and several toxic gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide are emitted into the air. Because of them, air quality can decrease, impacting to photosynthesis of plants and respiration of animals. In addition, many studies indicate that the three aforementioned gases are the main cause of greenhouse effect, resulting in global warming and climate change. Another concerning consequence is the gases can result in acid rain, destroying many species in nature. As regard to water, it can be affected by liquid waste from factories, including wastewater, sludge, oil and grease. Water species can die due to these pollutants or have to migrate to other habitats. To reduce these consequences, government should impose taxation on contaminating activities of companies and taxes should be as high as possible. By this way, factories have to consider whether not dealing with waste is still beneficial for them. If companies keep this behavior, they can face strict tax punishments, which can make their products exorbitant and affect to their profit.\n\nHowever, companies are not the only factor of environmental problems. Consumers are also the accomplice in the matter. Nowadays, there is a tendency among them that they use disposable goods instead of durable goods. For instance, customers are more likely to use plastic-wrapped paper cups, not conventional plastic, glass or porcelain mugs just because they want to use once only and then throw into trash bins. The trend is also apparent in using plates, people prefer the plastic-wrapped paper, not the typical plastic or the porcelain. Consequently, landfills will have to receive a great amount of garbage of disposable goods. The problem is the majority of these goods are made of materials which are usually difficult to decompose in short periods and toxic when incinerated. Therefore, people are likely to keep garbage in landfills. It is certain that land can get contaminated due to the consumption behavior of modern society. To restrict land pollution, government should impose taxes on disposable goods. Due to taxation, these goodsâ costs increase and consumers are more likely to restrict using them. By this solution, the amount of waste from disposable goods can decline. \n\nIn conclusion, the production of consumer goods impacts to the natural environment through companies, by waste, and customers, by using disposable goods. To reduce these negative effects, governments should impose taxes on waste and disposable goods. Due to taxation, companies and consumers have to think again about the possible benefits and losses they have, indirectly reducing their influence on the environment.",

The most obvious issue is that the demand of people. It is hard to admit that using products is the most needed demands of people. They use it almost every single days, so that goods production is growing up obviously. Another potential problem is producing goods allows companies remain businesses. This arises from the fact that firms need to keep their businesses running through produce goods for consumers.

In my opinion, this phenomenon leads to the extinction of flora and fauna and the growth in the proportion of deforestation.\n\nFirstly, many companies use national materials such as the skin of some animals to produce something. In other words, one of the requirements for some big corporations to run is animals product. For example, massive beauty product manufacturers use an animal to test their new merchandise which is harmful to the  environment moreover, they use animalsâ skin to produce  bags or wallet which increase the rate of extinction. Secondly, the increase in this trend line exacerbates deforestation which is treating the environment. Put differently, many of these products need wood to produce so, this catastrophe encourages companies to destroy the environment.\n\nTo tackle these problems there are several ways that companies can do to mitigates the impact of activities. On the one hand, they can search for alternative sources instead of using animal materials. For instance, they can use manmade raw materials to produce  consumer goods. On the other hand, to restrict companies from cutting trees, the government must put harsh roles on them. For example, companies that need natural facilities have limitations to using them and if they want to use more from natural sources they must pay high taxes.\n\nIn conclusion, the growth in the proportion of consumer goods results in the elimination of the natural environment.

The burgeoning in the manufacture of customer goods outcome in damage to the natural surroundings. In my perspective, this essay will explicate some of its causes as well as some problems to solve this matter. \n\nTo commence with, there are the predominant causes first one is. Pollution demand. To explain it, most of the people who are living in the society and other streets they use a plastic polythene, and when they buy from  the market when they finish their packet they through on the road, nor they do not put into the dustbine. However, it might occur some kind of unsaftyness of the masses.

Thus, this occur the problem of disease and asthma attack. Secondly, the main point is that less opportunities of job available in the factory. It means, if customers do not comes in the factory or shop to buy the garments so the owner of the factory will loss their sales in daily routine. Moreoso, if new fresher comes to the shop for job vacancy and the manager of the shop says their is no available and also they give a less salary to employees who working in the shop.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some Of the Tribble to solve this matter. To explain it, government should take high funds from the people and also provid some awareness and campaigned programs among society persons. In other words, there should be hight panelty to consumer goods who are doing these things. \n\nTo recapitulate, although I would like to despite in the fact that there some of the cause which can be followed by the people;however, some of the solutions which gives the benifit to the individuals to stop this habit.",

This essay will discuss the reason behind it and the ways through which it might be solved.  \n\nIncreasing demand for consumer goods comes at a cost of rising extraction and exploration of natural resources. Since, products like furniture, jewellery, luxury bag, marble, etc. are gifts of mother nature and the excessive demand for them would lead to substantial damage to the environment. Firstly, for example, any kind of jewellery whether it is gold, silver or diamond all extracted through the digging of land. In Surat, where there was the largest gold mine, a huge piece of land is dug and vacated, natural habitat has been disturbed and destructed. Therefore, increasing demand for these products would negatively impact the ecosystem and should be taken care of by taking appropriate measures.\n\nFurthermore, with the advancement in technology and science, more alternatives and artificial articles have been in the stage of development in the labs. Hence the shifting of people's interest in artificially developed items might lower the damages caused to the ecosystem. For instance, nowadays, scientists have imitated naturally extracted diamonds and come out with artificial ones. This can not be recognised with the human eye and can only be identified in the labs. Also, the value of  such an item is lower than the original one. Likewise, more alternatives could be developed to overcome the issue of damaging habitats. By doing so, such concerns can be resolved.\n\nIn the conclusion, the need for consumer goods can not be eliminated, instead, we should come out with other similar things which can replace the use of naturally produced goods. In my opinion, people should accept lab-originated items, though it will cost less, and less load on  nature.",

    "essay": "It is argued that the best method to recruit employees for the job is arranging interviewing sessions which are usually preferred by most large-scale companies, whereas the rest of the people have a strong faith in other ways of selecting workers. Although  the interview is an appropriate mode which allows one to check the individual's qualification level as well as background,  I believe that the other criteria are also significant for checking how much practical knowledge and skill is acquired by the recruiter.\n\nTo begin with, the first point viewpoint which is taking interviews can assist hiring managers to know the basic details about the person. This is because in the interviews manager has an opportunity to ask any questions regarding past experiences, certain backgrounds, qualifications and difficult questions relating to the certain field in which the employee wants to work in. For instance, the biggest Tata Steel company in the U.S. revealed that they are choosing the best employers from 10 out of 1 who do not lacks in any single question from the total questionnaire session. However, according to, my perspective interviews are not enough the other factors and capabilities required to run the business cannot be ignored.\n\nApart from this,  education is necessary but other practical knowledge is a must which can be checked by arranging demo sessions where the performance of the representative should be analysed. This is because the most essential abilities needed in an operator are leadership, coordination for teamwork, communication skills and independency which make a person an adequate employee and can be only experienced by the manager when analysing their trial during demo recruitment sessions. For example,  as per the news headlines in Argentina, the labourer's work is customised first before selecting the final workers. That is why if the person will already check it gives relief to the manager and no regret in future.\n\nTo conclude, it is clear that an interview is just like a discussion which does not disclose the inner abilities of human beings as I firmly opine that other ways are helpful for choosing skilled employees for the splendid earnings and growth of organisations.",

This essay will outline the highlighted reasons related to this problem, then suggest suitable measures.\n\nTo begin with, there are several reasons resulting in damage to the natural ecosystem due to the rise of consumer products. First of all, most people tend to use one only stuff on a daily basis because of their convenience function, especially  products made of plastic such as bags or cans. These types of habits completely harm the environment including indirect and direct ways. That means consumers who contribute to manufacturing large-scale products have a seriously long life-span. However, these are often used in the short term and thrown away in the environment that might not only waste, but also be eaten by wild animals. Addition, these goods are usually hard to biodegradable. A variety of reasons has been listed that could prove the cause of this issue is extremely huge and have serious outcomes in the future.\n\nHowever, it is possible to solve the problem of damaging the ecosystem resulting from the production of shopper goods. Firstly, the solution is appealing to consumers cutting down their products daily instead of applying the items that are environmentally-friendly. For example, in the modern age, there are favourite green goods, not only recycled things such as tote, bottles, glass or clothes, but also the appliance made from nature could be named baboo straw, banana leaf box. Beside that, the fevertly measure should be applied is the policies which can impose heavy tax for the goods being harmful for the natural environment, by contrast; tax-breaker for the items manufactured from eco-friendlier materials. Therefore, it can be said that the solutions provided should affect the consumers and the firm or business to create living conditions can demand not have negative impacts on the environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the production of consumer goods can completely harm the natural environment such as the large number of these kinds of products that have been manufactured. To solve this issue, the measures not only impact on the consumerâ perspective about the goods they use in daily life, but also on the business making the products to encourage them to create more items that are friendly with the environment.",

First, technological advancement is one of the main reasons. Nowadays, most children have smartphones or computers to study and entertain. This is due to the fact that their parents are so busy with their work, so they cannot help their children to learn at home. Consequently, students can learn on the internet with video records and apps, which are more interesting than theoretical knowledge at school. Second, teenagers have to study long hours every day.

One of the primary reasons for this, relates to a childâs concentration and small attention span. This essay will attempt to dissect this cause and propose some reasonable solutions that could help with mitigating this issue.\nDue to a childâs small attention span, conventional ways of teaching are inadequate in keeping their interest. In order to get through to a child, it is important to keep their interest for the duration of the study session or class and ensure they view it as a fun activity. Moreover, most schools find it hard to move away from traditional teaching methods such as dictation, using white boards, etc., especially in some developing countries, and as a result fail to engage their students. \nFurthermore, with massive technological growth in recent years, children are attracted towards their phones, tablets, computers, TV, etc. and provide a major source of distraction for them. Many studies have even linked the use of these devices to the release of endorphins resulting in a further dependency on technology. Combine this with the lack of engagement in classroom and education providerâs resistance to adapting to the changing world results in children having difficulties in paying attention. \nThis issue needs to be tackled on two fronts. Firstly, parents need to monitor and limit the use of technology outside of school hours. A structured schedule would be a good start and usage of phones & tablets may even be incorporated into a reward system. Schools should take responsibility for the second front. It is vital for them to coach themselves on changing technology and how it can be utilized for providing quality education to children. For instance, the use of interactive applications, modern teaching methodologies or structuring and creating custom curriculum for each child, based on their learning abilities, interests, etc.\nIn conclusion, it is important to acknowledge and understand the problem, as well as its root cause, utilize modern solutions and creative thinking that caters for the ever-changing modern world.

Whereas the kids, who are now more familiar with the use of computers, don't find old teaching styles interesting enough to foucs on studies for a long time. This problem can be overcome by teaching kids on computers as well as making learning an enjoyable experience for them so that they can have fun and learn at the same time.\n\nAlso, with the advancement of technology, kids are more distracted from their education than ever before. For instance, majority of the children have access to smart phones, tablets and TV's in their homes, which are the biggest cause of distraction, therefore kids are not getting enough time to pay attention towards their studies.

I personally stand to this notion since mostly people from this country have a stable life. This essay will elaborate more about this issues on the following paragraph.\n\nRich country typically pay attention most on some basic needs of its dwellers such as salary, tax, education and health access in order to make sure all of the citizen have same treatment. This is why their citizent have a tendency to feel satisfy as long as their basic needs is provided by government. For example Swiss is categorized as some of happiest country in the world, as a result their dwellers even with regular job living in a happy and healthy life. Thus, they do not ask for another new improvement related to economic aspect.\n\nFurthermore, as they already living in such a wealthy living condition, people from this country put their sight more entertaining themselves. This is mostly done with spending their time on vacation, learning new things and spend some time joining social organization such as involving in charity to support other people who struggle with economic matters. For instance, people in my village, receive donation from one social organisation in Finland, which focussed more on education with providing learning material, tools, uniform and even provide healthy food once i a week.\n\nTo conclude, as all the citizen has been living in decent life, government from rich country pay attention more on other aspects rather than economic aspect as their citizen mostly engaged in social things to satisfy themselves.",

    "essay": "It has been claimed that economic increase in rich countries does not imply more satisfaction for their citizens. In my opinion, I disagree with this statement for two reasons. The first one is that I think that getting richer, even if the person is already rich, will probably make the person feel better, and the second one is that I do not agree with generalizing peopleâs feelings.\n\nFirstly, we cannot deny that improving the economy in a rich country would contribute to the better well-being of people, increasing their life quality standards. One example of this is Finlandia, this country is one of the happiest nations in the world and its wealth index is enormous. People have time to dedicate to their families instead of working all day and children attend school only for three hours, having the best education system with the highest educational standards. All this contributes to an improvement of the national economy, making feel its citizens happier as their work-life balance gets better. \n\nSecondly, I think that the majority of citizens may be happier in case of economic improvement. However, not everything in life is about the economy, and I think that this may be related to why some people are not feeling better with this âgood newsâ. Nowadays, individuals are very confused about life, and even if they are wealthy, money cannot resolve what a person feels or desires. Statistics show the highest suicide rates in the richest countries, which proves that being economically stable and rich does not guarantee happiness.\n\nIn conclusion, even if some experts believe that an additional increase in the economy in a rich country would not make a difference among their citizens, I think that it would definitely contribute to the better well-being of most people increasing their quality of life standards and satisfaction levels. However, some sectors of society may be experiencing other issues in their lives that do not let them pain attention to other good things, like feeling happier because their country and their people are acceding to a better lifestyle standard. The economy may benefit people and bring stability into their lives but it cannot guarantee happiness for everyone.",

    "essay": "Besides the economic wealth of a country, there are other kinds of problems that society faces, such as citizen happiness, security issues at schools and the mental health of a population. That is why there is a discussion about whether people from rich countries would get even more satisfied with money increases in their lives. Some people believe that more money actually would not do any difference in the satisfaction of people from rich countries. Thus, this essay will discuss this statement above, also an opposite defence, and further expose my own opinion. \n\nThe population from rich countries generally has equally enough money to live comfortably. However, they carry other sorts of issues, which they might hope to be solved instead of enriching even more. For instance, in the United States frequently shooters invade schools or other crowded places to murder anyone without reason. In Europe, many people have gotten depressed in the midst of all the wealth. \n\nI also agree that more affluent citizens of the world will not get any more satisfied with more money which they already have a lot. As Maslowâs pyramid logic, rich country citizens already are well affluent with basic needs and now are expecting to have another kind of satisfaction other than economic wealth. It comes to a more complex level of necessity and needs, orbited around psychological and social spheres. \n\nThat way, in conclusion, people from rich countries do not get any more satisfied by more economic wealth because they have already enough, but still have needs, in other scopes though.",

For instance, the people in South Africa compare their country to an economic and modern country with high economic wealth. In addition, they are not joyful in their lives even if their country has a lot of natural resourcesÂ \n\nOn the other hand, if their country becomes increasingly involved in a business project, that will increase the availability of jobs with high salaries. Moreover, their lives are better than those of people who live in developing countries due to the additional wealth they have in industries like a business. For example, in 2019, the entire world faced COVID-19, and some economies dropped, whereas others, such as Saudi Arabia, controlled their economies in vaccines and medical products, which had no effect on their budgets.\n\nIn conclusion, the economic wealth of the country is essentially improving.

    "essay": "The thought of some experts, is that people from rich countries are not satisfied by an hypothetical increase in their economy. In this essay I will discuss this point of view and I will explain why I am not sure I agree with that.\n\nIt is generally believed by some professional figures, that additionals rise in economic wealth is not so crucial for a rich country. People from countries such as Japan, the U.S.A, Switzerland or Cina are aware of their wide economic power and these governments offer a lot of benefits for their citizens. Thus, people have yet what they want, such as funding for projects, well-organized cities,and  a lot of job opportunities.

As consequence due to this increase, they can ask for more funding for some start  up or to improve the technology equipment in schools. Personally, I tend to think as a matter of fact that this is the right view. Because it is logical that more money means more opportunities in any sector of the country. Hospitals, schools, museums and even historical buildings can have the possibility to obtain a lot of benefits.\n\nTo conclude, in this essay I discussed the general view of some experts about people from rich countries.

This scenario has several advantages and disadvantages, all of which will be discussed in detail.\n\nDiscussing the benefits of the above, the main advantage is that young people can learn about different cultures. What I mean by that is that when students travel the world during breaks, they learn about different traditions, languages and social skills. So, their lifestyle changes, and they become multilingual. In addition, students gain practical experience while working part-time. In other words, students learn how to manage their finances effectively, expand their understanding of business concepts, and explore opportunities for continued education. For example, a survey conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's admissions department showed that possessing all of these abilities enables students to outperform others academically.\n\nDespite the benefits of this situation, it also has some implications. The most important reason is that students lose motivation. To account for this, the information in their head disappears within a year of graduating from high school. As a result, learners will struggle to acquire knowledge from new courses while pursuing their degree education. Moreover, gaps necessitate meticulous preparation. In detail, during this time, if they cannot find projects or jobs, he/she may experience serious problems such as anxiety.

For instance, people tend to loose their skills by taking break in their daily activities and same goes for students as well because continuity is the only key which can make anyone skilled and composed. Moreover, students leave high school at very early age when they are 15 to 16 years old and that age is the period where students should study well and shape their career in a good way which can lead them to the successful future.\n\nTo summarise, taking break and work after high school can give life learnig experience but it also can reflect on your future studies which can lead many students in wrong way.",

I believe this has drawbacks for every individual like decreasing the essence of humanity and being an impatient person in society. \n\nOther people might perceive that there are fringe benefits to this advent of technology.

Thus, people would get those essential needs easily in the comfort of their homes. \n\nHowever, I strongly believe that this development of technology would diminish the essence of humanity.

Some people think that it would be more beneficial to use this tax money  to construct new homes and infrastructures.

Numerous large cities are confronted with a major housing problem because of increasing population density and lack of residential land. Because of that , it would be irrational to spend public money to restore old buildings, when more people need to buy a place to live. For example, if an old building in a certain city seems to be degrading and unfit for purpose, it should be demolished and replaced with a high-rise building which could accommodate hundreds of people.

I completely disagree with this idea and I believe it's much easier to prevent global warming from getting worse, and also we cannot afford its consequences.\n\nTo begin with, dealing with global warming results is much harder, while it's easier, and more achievable to take some simple yet fundamental steps. Air pollution is one of the main factors in global warming, and to be more specific, carbon dioxide produced as a result of fossil fuels, plays a major role in this pollution. Governments can significantly reduce CO2 production by applying extra tax on fossil fuel-based cars and encourage people to purchase electric vehicles. Also, people can be a great help in this situation, by making simple changes in their everyday life. For instance, they can commute to work by bicycle instead of taking a cab or worse, riding their own car.\n\nFurthermore, the consequences of prolonged and worsened global temperature rise are expensive, and it's too difficult to tackle. One of the first things that can occur as a result of it, is poles Ice melt, resulting in increased sea water level. This can cause lots of cities to sink, and many lives will be lost. For example,  recent research shows that if the world's temperature keeps rising at the current speed, the city of Bangkok in Thailand will go underwater by 2030. One more reason to argue is mass extinctions that could happen as a complication of global warming. Lots of species are at risk of extinction at this very moment, such as polar bears and penguins living in Antarctica.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that it's better to take steps to mitigate the world's temperature rising, because it's a lot easier to do so and we won't have to deal with its consequences.",

In fact, water surface has already increased, and it has affected the ecosystem. For instance, a survey conducted by the Korea Scientific Foundation has revealed that ice age will come back if humans cannot stop changing weather. Therefore, it is evident that if human beings are fail to prevent climate change, they will be extincted in the world.\n\n Secondly, as there are certain ways to protect the earth from climate change, individuals have to do their best, and living with fluctuating climate is the last choice when the world population have no way to prevent it. Not only can the comsuption of fossi fuels are reduced by the public with using public transportaion, it may also decreased by government to allocate state funds to develop eco-friendly energy.

Although the affected area has received emergency aids from domestic and international societies, the reconstruction works are still enormous and it may take decades to recover. Other examples such as melting ice sheets in the north pole which is caused by global warming,  would lead to the rise in ocean level and there is really not much that humans could do to change it. Furthermore, Coastal areas would be flooded and many species would lose theirs inhabits.  In order to tackle this problem  which is technically impossible to be solved and governments would have to spend an unimaginable amount of money \n\nThe fact has proven it is hard to survive and live with the consequence when climate change comes; therefore, every possible action must be taken to protect our environment and to prevent any disasters from happening. On the one hand, individuals would make a contribution by using reusable bags and going to work by walking or public transportation to reduce contamination to the environment.  On the other hand, governments and international organizations should promote eco-friendly resources in civilian use to help reduce emissions of fossil fuel. As a consequence, the world would develop in a more sustainable way and save more money in dealing with adapting to climate changes. \n\nTo sum up, I think prevention is always better than cure. we all should take actions to help to reduce pollutions.",

I am totally in support of this decision to find a way to maintain an equilibrium with our climatic conditions. This would afford us the opportunity to plan ahead of any Unknown circumstances caused by the atmospheric condition and ensure a clean, safer, and more conducive environment.\n\nFirstly, the knowledge of the atmospheric conditions prevents the occurrence of perilous situations that can destroy the environment such as flood, tsunami, hurricanes etc. For instance, a better knowledge of the weather forecast will ensure we plan our movement in situations of unexpected heavy rainfall . I was able to stay indoor during the recent heavy downpour due to the earlier information obtained from the weather forecast site which prevented me from being caught in the Flood.\n\nFurthermore, having adequate climatic knowledge makes the environment safer and more conducive to live for people. We are able to ensure a good drainage system is put in place by every occupants of a building through proper road planning. This saved my building from the recent flood that happened last week as majority of the houses in the south west area were been flooded as there were no proper layout for drainage.\n\nIn conclusion, making preparations to live with the effect of change in weather conditions will go a long way to make the country a safer and more conducive place for people to dwell in.",

I disagree with this opinion and possible arguments will be discussed below.\n\nFirst of all, to begin with, the main reason why this idea is not right is that we have opportunities to intervene and prevent further progression of this tendency. This is because of the fact that not only are there developments in technologies but also scientists and ecologists develop new ways of fighting. Therefore, if we have a chance to change the situation it seems extremely incorrect to ignore the problem. For example, recent research has shown that the introduction of pollution permits in Ukraine has shown outstanding results and pollution was decraesed by 20%.\n\nMoreover, another evidence why people should try to prevent climate change is that it may get extremely worse so the Earth may become uninhabitable. The major reason for such a thought is that climate deteriorates in a geometric progression and without appropriate measures this issue may become inevitable. Hence, the whole process of global climate change may accelerate and we will not be able to slow down it in the future.\n\nEventually, to conclude, I disagree with the opinion that humans just need to find a way t olive with environmental problems, firstly, since there areworking technologies which can at least slow sown the whole process and, secondly, because without intervention the situation may get extremely worse in the nearest future.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, due to the increase of reasonable concerns in society about global warming, different opinions emerged and some suggest that, rather than prevention, it is better to adjust to living with climate imbalance. In my opinion it is completely wrong, due to its slaughtering effect on inhabitant's life even with minor changes .\n\nFirst of all, the arguement of finding a way to live with climate change, could only be claimed by those, who could not understand the destructive impacts of small changes in globe's temperature . As many experts claimed, after the water level surge, so many cities would expected to be swallowed by oceans. Although some people could not acknowledge this matter, all living creatures are collectively under risk . Since the ice masses started to melt long while ago, this era seem to be so late for tiny resolutions. The bigger damaging factors, such as overuse of fossil fuels and waste methods other than recycling should have been adressed so long ago by the governments.\n\nConsidering the probable and close effects of the climate change, the only matter mankind may get used to is the new lifestyle, which is more friendly to the balance of atmosphere. This meaures can be exemplified by sun pannels and wind turbines for producing energy and developping sustainable recycling methods for wastes. Although there are some efforts for returning this destruction, obviously it is not enough. More powerful restrictions on humankind's dangerous actions, should be implemented on war footing, in order to saving our kind and other inhabitants of the whole world.\n\nIn conclusion, the climate change is an upcoming disaster unless mankind would not adress the issue effectively. Therefore, everyone should adjust to the measures instead of facing the irreversible effects of destroyed climate balance .",

I unequivocally disagree with such an opinion because it will cause several health issues in people and it will also increase the temperature.\n\nThe first reason for my disagreement is that climate emergency will make people ill. It generally occurs due to the toxic gases released in the air such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and helium, breathing such harmful substances makes a person suffer multifarious health issues. Moreover, it decreases the life span of an individual because of not getting sufficient oxygen. For example, a recent article in Times Now revealed that 27 per cent of people leaving in urban areas suffer Lung dysfunction at their early age. \n\nThe further reason is that global warming is a life-threatening problem. The rise in temperature  is a menace to the vegetables growing, as a ,result there will be very little food available for the individuals. Further, the meltdown of glaciers will raise the sea level, and many islands will soon be drowned in water. To illustrate, a survey by the University of Dubai revealed that  95 per cent of the country is dependent on the import of food due to global warming.\n\nTo conclude, I firmly believe that change in environment will lead to various diseases in human and it will also increase the degree celsius of the country.",

    "essay": "In the present world, the environmental problems become more and more severe with increasing attention by people. In this situation, some people reckon that we should adapt climate changes, rather than protecting the environment. From my perspective, I agree that human should prevent climate change. The following essay will prove this statement by discussing the negative consequence of only bearing the alter of weather and the true solution of climate change.\n\nTo begin with, the living circumstance will be much worse and even disastrous if people took no actions on restricting greenhouse gas emissions. Since there are growing needs for the fossil fuels that are using in various aspects such as car engine, plastic production and other necessary usages, the annual emissions of carbon dioxide will increase exponentially. As a result, the ice glacier will melt due to increase in the temperature, leading to growth in the sea that will submerge coastal cities. Thus, the protection of the environment is vital and also a prevention of destruction of human culture and population.\n\nMoreover, the best method to resolve problems caused by climate change is to face the situations, instead of escaping. If people are more aware of the severity of greenhouse effects, it would reduce greenhouse gases exhausted by the car engine as more people opt to use public transportation. As the advancement of technology is rapid and Earth has the function to fix the ecosystem and environment problems, coping with the problems of weather is tangible and approachable. Therefore, the most suitable way is to restrict daily emissions until the cutting-edge technology has a breakthrough that can tackle the problems of climate change directly and effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear to me that we must address climate change, and I disagree that people should find a way to live with it.

I completely disagree with this statement as I believe that we still have time to tackle this issue by considering governments and individual contribution to it and reduce the human impact on Earth's climate.\n\nWith regards to governments, I think that there are various measures that governments can take to prevent, or at least mitigate, climate change.  Firstly, governments could introduce laws to limit the carbon dioxide emission that leads to global warming.  They should impose 'green taxes' on drivers, airline companies, and other pollutants so that they are encouraged to invest in renewable energy production from water, wind and solar power. Although energy will be produced at higher costs, but this will help to reduce pollutants in the air and clean the surroundings. Furthermore,  governments should speed up afforestation by planting more trees as they help to reduce the carbon dioxide level in air and clean the atmosphere. Hence governments and big businesses can help in various ways to reduce the impact of climate change on the Earth.\n\nAs for individuals, they can also play a vital role in preventing effects of climate change. For instance, we should use recycled products for our daily use, as plastic causes hazardous effects on the environment. I think we should use paper bags instead of plastic bags. This is because plastic causes harmful effects on Earth, especially in the oceans as  it is not easily decomposed, and impact aquatic species badly. In addition to this, we can also try to limit our contribution to climate change by becoming energy efficient, by flying less, using bicycles and public transports. Therefore, individuals should also be encouraged to help in mitigating effects of climate change as they are effective.\n\nIn conclusion, it is my firm belief that if governments and individuals come together, we can address the problem of climate change, instead of trying to find ways to live with it.",

To give just one example, I am not optimistic that we would be able to cope with minor attempts. Millions of people would be displaced by flooding, tsunami within low-lying areas. These people would lose their homes and also their jobs, and they would be forced to migrate to nearby cities or perhaps to other countries.

    "essay": "Climate change is one of the most essential topics in todayâs world. Accordingly, there are many approaches in order to solve this major problem. While there are some people who consider climate change as something that can be lived with, others give it extreme importance and look for powerful solutions for its prevention. I strongly believe that this severe issue is something to be dealt with. For that reason, we must take individual actions and force governments to act in accordance with necessary precautions.\n\nFirst and foremost, I must state that raising awareness and commencing individual action constitutes the most effective part considering the prevention of the alterations in the climate. Specifically, individual action forms a cumulative organization due to its nature. To illustrate, decreasing the frequency of using automobiles and aircraft makes a considerable difference in terms of the continuing process of climate change. Clearly, it provides low waste of gas which spreads to the air. \n\nSecond, after taking individual action, people must cajole governments into taking relevant measures for the elimination of possible outcomes of this matter. Furthermore, all around the world, governments are initiating and managing investments with a plethora of other governments or private companies in order to maintain economic development. However, the irresponsible behaviour of politicians in monetary terms harms the future of young generations. Therefore, to exemplify, people must force governments not to make investments in fossil fuel and sectors that cause high carbon emissions.\n\nIn conclusion, the tendency of living with climate change and not trying to stop its negative effects in the environment should never be the policy of any country. We absolutely cannot just live with it. Instead, everybody must comply with the rules and regulations set forth under respected institutions and non-governmental organizations for avoiding the consequences of it. By taking individual steps and pressuring governments, we can get positive results and leave a clean and viable earth for the next generations.",

While it is believed by some people that preventing such a threat to the environment is essential, others think we should just adapt to it.This essay will argue why it's totally preposterous to think that our environment could survive global warming or other climate related disasters without doing anything to prevent that.\nDespite the major risks, it is believed that controlling the earth's temperature is beyond our power. Because it is connected to many other factors none of which can be stopped or even predicted. For instance, ocean levels are rising when volcanic eruptions occur which makes the temperature of the water much more higher. Therefore, climate change is not necessarily something we can always prevent.\nIn contrast, scientists and environmental experts endeavor new approaches to face the fact that the universe is much more heated than ever. They believe so because many attempts have been tried already with great success. For example, Japan performs experimental trials each year and tests the effects of such experiments on the environment.It is for these reasons, it would be logical to think a lot can be done to protect the environment from the rising heat.\nIn conclusion, it sounds really easier to just find a way to deal with the detrimental effects of the heated atmosphere instead of preventing them.

    "essay": "In recent decades, global warming has been receiving a great deal of media attention around the world due to its substantial impacts on human life. Although the idea of coexistence between climate change and humans appears reasonable, this cannot be viewed as the ultimate approach for humankind to combat climate change.\nThere are a number of reasons why the coexistence can do more harm than good. First, climate change is largely shaped by human-caused geoengineering rather than nature itself. For example, in order to produce the energy that drives the worldâs economy, most nations rely on carbon- rich fuels like coal, oil and gas, which directly correlates with the intensification of global warming. Second, even if citizens agree to keep the environment the way it is, corporations, especially in the manufacturing and mining industries, would not as that would affect their profits. Therefore, it can be implied that if corporations were not held accountable for their contribution to global warming as in the case of coexistence, the issue of climate change would inevitably be exacerbated.\nIt is more economically sound to actively prevent climate change than to ignore it. In fact, the costs, either financial or non-financial, of dealing with future consequences of climate change can be overwhelming. For instance, the increase in intensity and frequency of storms can cause massive destructions and deaths in many coastal areas, which would take decades to recover. In addition, rising temperatures have also contributed to the extinction of species worldwide. It should be noted that the extinction is irreversible and comes at great cost to the ecosystem and apparently humans living within it.\nIn conclusion, actively combating global warming must be regarded as top priority given the high urgency. Governments and corporations worldwide should take steps to ensure that climate change remains at bay.",

Some of them are successfully doing it through restorative methods. Conversely, others who do not have any remnants of historical places are obliged to create new ones.

This essay will discuss why existing public structures should be maintained rather than build new ones.\nFirstly, existing museums or halls are places of history, which has preserved our culture for hundreds of years and one which serves as a point of reference. The continuous maintenance of these public buildings, our cultural heritage is preserved. For example, the famous cathedral church in France was totally burnt, but instead of building it in a new location, it was decided that the building be rebuilt on the same land in order to maintain history.\nSecondly, in these buildings are located precious items such as paintings, books, etc. Which are items that shouldn't be lost in transit either deliberately through theft or unforeseen circumstances. By building new museum, the movement of these items will be required and some may be lost in transit. A look at what happened in Britain is an example where Queen Elizabeth's father's writings were lost in transit, only to be found in a village in East Germany. \nThirdly, tourism is boosted because of these historical places which people have read about on the internet and the pages of newspapers. By building new ones, history will be erased, cultural heritage destroyed and no place for holiday goers to visit.\nIn conclusion, it's advisable to continue to maintain and guild public places where history is kept as this will continue to attract tourists who want to visit for the purpose of seeing the old building rather than build new ones which tourists won't be interested because it has no history.",

    "essay": "These days, the amount of money spent on space travel has been increasing to develop more new technology, and opponents believe that the money should be invested in other sectors in order to fully utilize the investment. In my opinion, there are several reasons why I do not agree with the statement. \n\nFirst and foremost, space exploration has boosted scientific research. The money spent on space tourism is the key for scientists to invent new technology, which may also lead other industries to work with the space industry on research and development. For instance, smartphones, cameras, software, and robots are developed in the space travel sector. Besides, space exploration can create lots of jobs that help millions of people around the world find jobs in the space industry. To further illustrate, engineers, space designers, and trainers are all in high demand. Hence, when there are more job opportunities available in the space sectors, the unemployment rate will decrease, thus boosting the country's economy. \n\nBy contrast, some critics argue that the government should spend money in the public sector instead of on space tourism. It is true that the money spent in public sectors such as transportation, maintenance of public infrastructures, and education will benefit the masses. To quote an example, the government could utilize the money to enhance the education system so that more kids had the chance to get a better education. The money should also be spent on upgrading public facilities like hospitals, police stations, and train stations, which could greatly improve the citizens' quality of life. Furthermore, these funds should be used to subsidize the low-income population so that they can at least get a decent meal, potentially reducing the occurrence of social issues in a country. \n\nIn conclusion, the government can spend money in the private or public sectors in a variety of ways.

    "essay": "Indeed, people work hard and earn wages for their needs and preferences. So they have the right to claim fair salaries for the work which they have done and keep whatever they want. However, we should not forget that although we have rights, we are somewhat obliged to society in order to do that I believe that as a citizen, we have a moral obligation and responsibility to pay the tax from our earnings.\n\nIn todayâs world, money is considered to be everything. As every people should spend money on essential needs. For example, food, transport, medical bills, shelter and education are the basic expenses of citizens. Apart from that, many families tend to save and invest a significant portion of their income. People always worry about their future and safety. On the basis of that point, some people need to keep all their money without allocating a pound to tax and they believe it is their right. \n\nNevertheless, citizens should be obliged to pay taxes to the government for a number of reasons. First, taxes are collected for the sake of expanding and maintaining public services like infrastructure facilities, education, health services and transport. In addition to that state need to ensure the countryâs security and keep the stable economy of the country. In short, through tax, which makes sure that everyone has affordable basic facilities and comfortable living standards. \n\nTo sum up, even though many people think that they should not pay the duty, a portion of that money is useful to the stability of the country. It provides stability as well as equal opportunities for every citizen. For that reason, we should neglect our duty to pay a contribution to the betterment of the country and society.

    "essay": "Some advocate the view that the government should not promulgate income tax for its citizens. To the best of my knowledge, I totally disagree with this statement inasmuch as the funding from taxation can be used to contribute to the benefit of individuals and the society as a whole.\n\nTo begin with, the majority of money from tax play a profound role in improving the living quality of the inhabitants. The justification is that the state budget is crucially important to upgrade the public infrasstructure, which lately leading to a convinient and safe area for people to live and travel. An prominent instance is that, with the timely enhancement of the irrigation, a city located near rivers would reduce setbacks of moonsoon tide. Furthermore, it is imperative to allocate money attribute to the facility in the vincinity neibor namely growing green parks, protect the environments, sustainable growth.\n\nOn the other hand, tax is consider as a method of saving in case of unpredictable situation so that the authority may need to get through difficulty time. The main rationale is that, in time of natural disaster or spreading disease, a public fund is the first aid to support vulnurable people. Therefore, if it was not the clever decision from the government to ennact the vaccine campainge for the community, the unprecedented pandamic of covid-19 could not be controled in minized consequences.\n\nInconclusion, tax is set as a catalys to the security of common advantage for people. In that case, a particular proportion of employees' income is encourage to attribute to the state in order that the living quality can thrive.",

    "essay": "Taxes are essential for the growth of the country. A group of individuals believe that they should keep all their earnings and should not have any obligation in paying the taxes to the government. I personally disagree with this notion and firmly believe that citizens are entitled to pay the taxes for the betterment of the country and for an enhanced way of living.\n\nTo begin with, taxes are used by the government for developing their nations. Taxes are allocated to various kinds of essential matters. Firstly, they are used to develop infrastructure facilities like roads and highways, improving or replacing existing transportation units. Secondly, taxes are utilised for providing residents with decent medical services and education facilities. For example, in countries like Canada and Australia, the citizens enjoy free medical and education facilities as they contribute to the government in form of taxes. Last but not least, the government spends huge amount collected through taxes on military services and facilities for maintaining the political stability and harmony of the country.\n\nAnd then, people should also look that taxes they have paid, will also be beneficial for themselves sooner or later.Some of the funds collected by the government are used for retirement funds. For instance, people above 60 years of age who find difficult to secure a job with minimum wages can rely  on these funds. Therefore, people should not keep all their earnings to themselves and must comply on paying the taxes to the government.\n\nTo conclude, I do not agree that people should have a hold of all the money they earn as taxes are the primary source for the government for building the nation and ensuring that its citizen leads an enhanced lifestyle.",

    "essay": "It is argued by many individuals that there shouldn't be any taxes on their hard-earned money as they don't get many facilities from the government. This essay partially disagrees with this notion as the government need money to run the system. \n\nTo begin with, It is really painful to share our hard-earned money with the state when we don't get any direct benefits for the same. Additionally, people felt cheated when they need to pay the taxes on their every purchase when they have already paid the taxes on their income. Moreover, the system doesn't provide any financial security to them in case of any mishappening. For example, recently millions of people in India lose their job due to the Covid- 19 pandemic but none of them get any financial benefits from the state. \n\nHowever, I partially disagree with this viewpoint as we all received many indirect benefits from the government such as infrastructure, subsidies fuels, hospitals, schools and universities. Moreover, they provide a secure environment to us with the help of police and other forces. Additionally, the state runs many schemes in which poor people get subsidies food from the state. For example, Food Corporation of India has purchased 80 million ton of wheat and rice in 2019 and they have distributed this to the people who are below the poverty line.\n\nTo conclude, not every taxpayer may get direct benefits from the government but I believe that it is really essential to run the system smoothly and it helps everyone either directly or indirectly.",

Therefore, a section of the society believes in keeping the earned income to themselves by not paying any taxes to the nation. Even though they have genuine reasons behind, I completely disagree with the above mentioned notion.\n\nEvery person prepares the budget wherein their motive is to save maximum money. There are innumerable reasons  behind it; to meet their over exceeding expenditures; to employ the income into a more lucrative idea or maybe the dissatisfaction of the government.  For example, in a family of four members wherein only one person is earning he has to work really hard to manage the needs of the family and pay out the taxes. In such a situation they always look for additional income by skipping the tax fee and investing somewhere else. In total, people believe the non payment of duty will resolve their financial issues\n\nHowever, on the contrary, one has to always look at the broader spectrum. The tax amount received by the state is being used for the welfare of the citizens only. The development of the parks and historic buildings, reserves to meet contingencies  and many more are being taken care of by them. In some countries, namely Canada, contribution amount act as a health insurance to the people and also provide free education in the schools. Moreover, it is the moral responsibility of every citizen.

This not only includes the(ESSENTIAL) essentials( ESSENTIAL) services such as a state-of-the-art healthcare system , educational institutions, supply of running water and electricity, but also includes facilities for leisure such as parks, stadiums, and so on.

However, some people advocate that they should not be liable to pay any amount and should keep all the money they make. This essay argues in favor of this statement as it helps in raising the standard of people and decrease the corruption in the official departments.\nFirstly, a salaried person would be able to have more cash at this disposal, if does not have to pay anything in the form of tax. One can fulfill a lot of dreams from this extra money, which will improve his standard of living, and will further help in raising the Happiness index of the country. For example, a person earning Rs 10, 00,000 annually has to shell out 20,000 in form of income tax. If a person retains this amount, then he can use it to go on a trip or buy a new furniture which will definitely make him more happy. This is clear, that more cash helps in raising the standard of people.\nSecondly, less money with the authorities helps in curbing prevailing corruption among them. Authorities would be having limited amount of means to develop the countryâs infrastructure and they would use it to the optimum level. For example, bureaucrats misuse the hard earned penny of people by using it in unnecessary tasks. When they would be having limited means they would think critically and make the best use of the available resources. \nTo conclude, the notion of not paying tax to authority will help in the overall development of the country by improving the happiness index and reducing red-tapism .",

This tendency is caused by various ads made by the companies which are entertained so that consumers will be compelled to open the web. For example, teenagers who previously tend to saving, after they felt curious to visit the platform, they will explore all of the products there and just buy one for the first time, but in the following days it is inevitable that they will repurchase.

    "essay": "Recently, there has been an influx of advertisements from opposing companies that target  customers. This has led to increased confusion as people are uncertain of which goods or services better cater to their needs. As a result of this, more must be done by the governing authorities to protect buyers from these corporations. This essay will address the manner in which consumers are swayed by advertisements and possible methods to guard them.\n\nRegarding the influence of advertisements, people are often exploited by marketing. Numerous industries are aware of the power of good campaining, thus they often purchase and utilise various avenues to gain the attention of possible buyers. This is evident in the numerous notifications that pop up while browsing the internet.  Social networking giants are paid by numerous consumer sites to advertise their products.  These are often other companies that are operate through e-commerce such as food delivery services, online clothes stores and film sharing sites. All these work together to permit the individual to select and purchase items all while staying in the comfort of their homes. Although this is major progress in terms of ease of purchase it has also led to passive buying with many customers failing to read the fine print and suffering dire consequences in the future.\n\nAs these products are usually poorly regulated by consumers, more must be done by those in power to prevent unnnecessary purchases by civilians. Although many have argued that customers ultimately hold all the power and can decide against it,  purchasing of goods has become an increasingly difficult terrrain to nagivate . Many huge social media companies now have neuromarketing sub-groups that work buy buying data from sites that individuals visit and display these everytime the user logs on to the internet. This begs for more to be done in terms of regulation. Governments should prevent this by first educating the public on the dangers of online shopping.  This could be done by having national campaigns  warning purchasers on what is really taking place, as well as ensuring transparency on all internet sites. This could lead to a safer environment for purchasers. \n\nTo conclude, Consumers are usually unaware of the manipulation that  takes place on the different avenues they frequent. The government needs to take action to prevent corporations from influencing them and create a better method for buyers and sellers alike.",

    "essay": "In todayâs material world, we are inundated with various forms of advertising. In my view, this can be dangerous as it encourages us to spend without thinking and young people, in particular, need some protection from it.\n\nThe first point to make is that advertising does make us spend money we do not need to. There are nowadays so many different ways companies promote their products and services, ranging from television commercials to simple flyers that we cannot escape  it.   If,  for example, you watch a football match on television, you will see the logos of the tournament sponsors. Likewise, if you watch the latest blockbuster movie, very probably you will see a product placed in the film by some advertising agency. The volume of this advertising means that we, as consumers, tend to be profoundly influenced by it and buy without thinking.\n\nIt is not easy to decide how to regulate advertising. Clearly, governments ought to restrict advertisements for harmful products such as alcohol and tobacco. They do not have the power, however, to control other forms of advertising. This means we need to use our common sense when we go to the shops, and ask ourselves whether we really need to\n\nmake that purchase. Parents should, however, ensure that young people are protected from too much exposure to advertising. This can mean simply explaining that it is not in fact necessary to buy the newest Xbox, or simply turning the television off.\n\nMy conclusion is that while we cannot escape advertising or its effects in the modern world, children should be encouraged not to pay too much attention to it",

    "essay": "There has been much discussion revolving around the issue of whether consumers are influenced by advertisements or not, as they are faced with a maximum ratio of promotion from competing brands. In my opinion, I think clients get affected by the posters. In this essay, I will highlight how customers are influenced by the big brands marketing campaign and what solution we can take to protect them.\n\nTo begin with, advertisements plays a major role in marketing strategy as well as in the growth of  products. First and foremost, big companies hire actors and actresses for the branding of their products, as a result,as a result they not only influence individuals but also help companies financially in increasing the sales of the items. Moreover, these days organisations are more focused on digital content so that audience gets more controlled by their items. For example, Cadbury most chocolate advertisements are digital content based which influenced people to buy their product and try at least once.\n\nHowever, there are several measures to be taken to be safe from them. Firstly, we should try to skip the ads while watching anything on social media ,as not only do they get us confused but also encourage us to take wrong decisions. Secondly, instead of getting influenced by the ,models we should more focus on the quality and the specifications of that products. For Instance, In a recent survey of Times of India in 2018, one-fourth of the population buys an item as they get influenced by their favourite actors and actress without checking the quality of the product.\n\nIn conclusion, individuals get influenced by increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies whereas, before buying anything they should check the specifications and quality of the products instead of  getting influenced by the advertisements of their favourite models.",

Food delivery apps such as swiggy and zomato are benefitting the most out of this.  a recent study on hunger shows that when your stomach is empty the brain does not function to its maximum capacity. When lunchtime strikes, hunger takes over and you will instantly see the application popping up notifications to take advantage of your starvation. you end up ordering online rather than eating home-cooked meals. Moreover, these apps record the time of your food order and have a history of your eating habits knowing exactly when to remind you through their campaigns so you end up spending more.\n\nIn order to avoid being influenced by marketing, people need to be more cautious of what they are signing up for. Every app and browser asks for permission before they start showing relevant search-related pages. It is in the consumer's hands to decide how much information they want to share, most people do not realise that they are in control. the browser settings or application settings can be adjusted if they do not want to be bombarded with multiple advertisements from various companies. they can also choose to not allow history tracking so that their data cannot be used against them. \n\nBy way of conclusion, people can easily get influenced through many campaigns, if the individual educates him/herself then they can avoid the impact from this.",

    "essay": "The world is becoming a competitive place. Hence, to survive the competition, businesses come up with innovative advertisements. Although it should focus on the utility of the product, nowadays it contains harmful facts. This essay will discuss that how consumer behaviour is influenced by them as well as will also discuss possible ways out to overcome this that are mainly enablement of stricter acts and educating the people.\n\nFirstly, the advertisements have an enormous impact on the way customer behaves. The colourful digital content frequently portrays beneficial usage of the product. Thus, without much ,knowledge humans believe them. For example, although the food of KFC is labelled as unhealthy by various countries, buyers do not pay much attention to such alerts. This is mainly due to the attractive story that their advertisement communicates. Henceforth, I believe that the public receives an erroneous message from them which influence their purchasing habits.\n\nHowever, the introduction of proper regulatory laws, as well as spreading awareness in  society can solve the long-term problem. The government should set up a regulatory body that will monitor all of them before they are released for the citizens, as well as they should also check the content of it. Besides that, a mass education camp about numerous daily use commodities should be launched. These events should focus on educating the commoners on the utility of commonly used things. For instance,  paracetamol tablets, are available in the market with numerous brandings. Although the work of it is same, some of them are expensive. As we are not aware of the generic names; thus, we trust the advertisements and buy the costly ones. Moreover, if we watch the TV commercials of such companies, they are misleading. Henceforth, the authorities should investigate such cases, and ensure that the fallacious facts are not getting communicated through the mass media.\n\nTo conclude, in my opinion, humans are mesmerized by things that they see visually every day. Therefore, such visuals play a vital role in their shopping patterns. Hence, it is the responsibility of the governing bodies to administer advertisement and to protect the habitats of a country by teaching them, so that they do not fall into misleading traps.",

This can lead to wrong influence among the population. In this essay, we will discuss how do customers get influenced and what can be employed in order to make them safe from fake articles.\n\nCompanies have been bombarding  normal people with numerous commercials which have had their own effect. These displays can be misleading sometimes, as in many cases the products shown in the reel are not at all similar to the real ones. To illustrate, in many commercials of cars, it is shown performing off-road stunts which is not better for the car in the real world. Another reason which can be highlighted is, some industries can build peer pressure over a specific age by including famous personalities in the bulletins. For instance, alcohol brands often hire prominent characters for the promotion of the brand among  teenagers which is actually very appalling. \n\nThis can be brought to a halt by some serious actions taken by the government. Firstly, there should be regulations over the difference between reel and real products. If the difference between both is much higher then impositions should be applied to such establishments. Secondly, if any product is having an influence over a specific generation of the society with wrongdoings, then immediately such organizations should be banned. This can demotivate the owners who are trying to sell their merchandise in an unsound method.\n\nTo sum up, commercials are a part of the modern lifestyle nowadays. They can have merits like an increasing market for more competition as well as demerits as fake or misleading adverts. The demerits should be controlled by the specific bodies of government in order to protect the local community.",

    "essay": "In todayâs world, the fierce rivalry among business entities has given rise to a proliferating number of advertisements broadcast on almost every means of media. While this phenomenon is not without positive influence, its adverse implications are more significant. Therefore, there will be some solutions proposed in this essay to  diminish its negative effects on consumers.\n\n \n\nNeedless to say, a rise in the number of advertisements has allowed viewers to be more well-informed of the newly-launched products. Given the unprecedented rate of technological advancement in recent years, without these means of marketing, consumers may fall behind the most innovative features introduced to the market, which may impede them from making  sensible purchasing decisions. However, such surge in adverts may bring about some underlying effects on purchasing behavior. Since consumers are constantly bombarded with advertising in various manifestations, they are more prompted to make a purchase without thorough consideration. It stands to the reason  that promotional campaigns are designed to prey on humansâ insecurities such as their inferiorities in physical appearance or their desire for social inclusion; as a result,  viewers are more liable to fall victim to buying unnecessary items out of spontaneity. Moreover, the competitiveness among companies has led advertisers to resort to dishonest tactics with the sole aim to boost sales. The most widely adopted strategy seems to exaggerate the true values of the advertised products, which induces the consumers to take preference of them and may lead to future purchases.\n\n \n\nThere are some possible solutions to tackle the problems engendered from such a trend. The most prominent responsibility should lie with the government since they are those who grant permission for adverts to be broadcast on mass media. Therefore, there should be a board  of experts whose job is to screen, monitor and cross-reference the advertisement contents and their actual effectiveness. The public should also take actions to protect themselves. It is recommended that before buying an item, one should do some research by either consulting the previous buyers  or taking their needs and affordability into serious consideration. With all of these measures joining forces, consumers are more liable to be well-protected from the invasion of misleading advertising.\n\n \n\nIn short, advertisements, with its  genuine nature , should provide useful information about new products in the market. However, given the tough competition between companies, this marketing tool may  provoke spontaneous purchasing decisions. Therefore, both the government and its citizens should take proactive measures in order to foster a healthy society.",

Consumers are influenced by advertisements in both positive and negative ways. This essay shall delve into the ways adverts affect the common man and suggest ways to protect people from the negative effects of adverts.\nOn the positive side ads tell us about the new products that are launched in the market. They also tell us about the working of these products. After seeing the ads, consumers can go to the market and select things of their choice. On the other hand, advertisements can cause people to be dissatisfied with what they\nalready gave and make them want more. Being exposed again and again to products which one cannot afford leads to dissatisfaction. Furthermore, not all parents are in the position to afford the goods which the children see advertised and want to possess. This often leads to feelings of inadequacy among them. In addition to this advertisements lead to materialism and people lay too much emphasis on material goods. People are prepared to work long hours or even turn to crime to get these goods.\nThe solution is not simple as advertising has become a very pervasive medium. To begin with, advertisements which make false claims should be banned. Then there should be consumer awareness programmes. Consumers should be warned against too much consumerism. Finally, advertisements for liquor and those ads which show stunts should also be banned.\nTo put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that today we are influenced a lot by adverts, both in positive and negative ways, without adverts we would lose a valuable source of revenue which is used for the benefit of majority. Our lives would be dull without these ads and there is not much that can be done against the consumerism they promote",

    "prompt": "Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?",
    "essay": "Today, we are living in the world in which there is a boom in the forms of advertising because advertisements on mass media are regarded as an effective way so that companies launch their products to consumers. Nonetheless, I assume that advertisements can change viewers' awareness and behaviours. Therefore, in this essay the influences of advertising and solutions for protecting buyers would be discussed in detal.\n\nIndeed, I assume that advertisements can change viewers' awareness and behaviours. Many of us are susceptive to interesting images coming from advertisements; in other words, the excessive exposure of advertising information would make consumers believe that the advertised products are qualified and fashionable, and many people are willing to spend a great deal of money on their shopping, or even they buy unnecessary things for their life. Additionally, it is not difficult to recognize that many ads are aiming at children who will beg their parents to purchase products advertised on television such as clothes, shoes and toys; that is, many families will have to suffer the increase in their living expenses. What is more, advertising images convey exaggerate information. For example, many companies use the images of superstars or models to advertise with the message that men ought to be rich and athletic while women are charming and beautiful; this has made many persons feel unhappy with their current life.\n\nIn order to solve problems relating to advertising, some resolutions as follows should be taken into account. From a governmental perspective, censoring commercial advertisements must be conducted seriously; at the same time, governments had better impose laws to protect consumers from shopping. With regard to the role of enterprises, once new brands or products are advertised, they must supply the public with information of what are the differences between quelified goods and counterfeit ones, thereby helping consumers make right decisions about purchasing goods.\n\nIn conclusion, many pieces of information deriving from commercial advertisements have affected people negatively Thus, measures, in my opinion, are authorities who play the primary role in protecting consumers.",

Other argue that it would be better if these countries can spend money on the children to take part in sports. \n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?",
    "essay": "In today's ,world most countries are focusing the worldwide competition. so it has become an integral part of the present world. While proponents of the arguments are in favour. the opponents are completely against  spending a huge of money  on supporting their competitors . In my opinion , focusing on both children's and competitors' funding is so important for the country's development.\n\nlet's see elaborately in the below paragraph.\n\nTo commence with , there are a number of arguments in favour of my belief . The most prominent one is that spending money on competitors will develop the country's growth. The research conducted by  Western Sydney University reveals that both are more important. Because, For thinking about the future children's spending even important. Secondly , encouraging children's sport often cause massive results in future.\n\nOn the other hand , critics may point out that one of the most common disadvantages of competitors' spending leads to country development. But it works on a certain period of circumstances only.which can result in a number of serious Consequences.A survey conducted in the united states reveals that competitors are the backbone of worldwide competition to keep the country to a certain standard.\n\nTo conclude, even when there are a lot of demerits to competitors' spending, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.In my point of view both the spendings are more important in order to develop the country to keep it in the maximum position. To encourage the children's sport education wants to provide more facilities in schools and parks.The effective use of the facility should be promoted . However, its misuse should be condemned.",

    "prompt": "Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement.\n\nWhat is your opinion?",
    "essay": "Many argue that the government should look after elderly people and provide them with pensions after they are 60 years old. However, others say that people themselves should save money for later use. I agree with the former viewpoint because savings would not be enough to support people, and residents pay taxes to the government all their lives.\n\nThe main reason why the government must take care of old people is that their savings would not be able to support their medical bills, house rent, and monthly groceries. This is because the inflation rate has been quite high in the last few decades and there are no signs that the inflation rate will go down in the coming years. For example, a recent study in the US found that in the coming years, the prices of housing, medical and other necessary items will go so high that it would be very difficult for people to buy certain items. Therefore, it is necessary that the authorities should look after elderly people.\n\nAnother reason behind this is that people pay taxes to the government authorities while they are working. The government collects taxes from residents as an income tax, service tax, and property tax. Therefore, people already have paid enough to the state that they can pay monthly pensions to all elderly people. To illustrate, the UK government imposes a 30% tax on income, and the government earns millions of pounds. A small portion of this income should be distributed to people in the form of pensions to older people.\n\nIn conclusion, the government should take responsibility for their citizens for their health and financial assistance because monthly savings will not be able to cover their monthly bills, and taxes are paid to the taxation authorities by people all their lives.",

    "essay": "Ageing is an unavoidable stage every human has to go through. While some believe the authorities are responsible for caring for and supporting their aged citizen financially, others suggest individuals should take  responsibility of their retirement. In my opinion, governments should offer basic care and funding to their retired population. This essay will discuss the reasoning behind my belief.\n\nTo begin with, if governments provide basic health care and financial support to the elders, it may release the pressure from the next generation who feel obligated to pay for all of their parentâs expenses. Therefore, they can focus on their production and education which will benefit the country. For example, many young people from Hong Kong contribute almost half of their income to their parentâs care due to the lack of retirement support from the government, thus the pressure of overworking reduce the motivation of citizen to pursue higher education or improvement. As a result, Hong Kong has been falling behind in educational and industrial development, furthermore, overpassed by countries like Singapore as the international financial hub. \n\nMoreover, the aged population was once labour resources, who paid taxes and contributed production and value to the country. Consequently, they deserve fundamental healthcare and basic needs such as housing and transportation support from their government. For instance, retired Australian citizens are entitled to pension and their medical bills are covered by the Medicare scheme. \n\nIn conclusion, I strongly recommend governments  take care of their aged citizens and offer financial support to them. Not merely because less pressured working citizens would be more productive, moreover, secured and motivated labour would bring positive influences to the development of their state. Also, the retirees, who once dedicated themselves to the development of the country, are well-deserved  care in return.",

    "essay": "In this present-day world,it has to be said that old age has a great many hardships;mainly for money related matters.Some people argue that the government has to provide financial help to the aged category people whereas others believe that people have to plan their retirement age early.I think that both the government and individuals have to contribute to retirement age,and this essay will enunciate both notions in detail with appropriate instances.\n\nTo commence with, it is indeed an irrefutable fact that the significance of planning a retirement life is increasing each decade because of the cost of living.There are myriads of plans available in banks and other cooperative industries for retirement; these kinds of plans definitely help to maintain retirement life without any hassle and bustle.For instance, a survey was conducted by Harvard University about the pre-planned  retirement life in 1000 elderly.The result shows about 90% of them are leading satisfying life than other aged people those who do not have any plans.In light of this survey, the public has been started to support pre-planned old age life.\n\nHowever planned an old age life, the authority has to provide funds for medical care of the elderly;similarly, the officialdom has to cut high taxes in their old age to reduce their agony and anguish.For instance, an experiment was conducted by the Iceland government by providing old-age pensions for their senior citizens for 2 years and watched the result.The result shows about 90% of them are happy because of this extra fund from the state as well as this is reduced their age-related stress to an extent.\n\nIn conclusion, planning retirement life from a younger age is a responsibility of people,although, public funds are also needed in their old age to get good medical care so the authority has to provide funds for elderly people.",

    "essay": "There has been a mixed opinion on whether government should take care of old people by providing financial support after they retire or they should take care of themselves. I strongly feel that governments need to take care of the elderly people in their old age. \n\nElderly people are the pillars of the society who has led their lives in shaping the future of the country. During their working years individuals have a lot on their plate to take care of like providing for the family, taking care of their parents, providing for childrenâs' education and etc. In addition to this, every person pays taxes as their part to develop the society. In few countries people almost pay 30% of their income as taxes to the government. \n\nIt is the governments' responsibility to take care of their citizens at their old age. With many responsibilities on their heads, few individuals may fail fund for their retirement. In such cases governments can lend their hands to such people who have worked hard their entire lives so that they can retire peacefully. The governments can take initiatives to help these people by establishing nursing homes, providing retirement funds to employees and etc. \n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that all the governments should start initiatives to provide financial support to old people after they retire.

I strongly agree with the former opinion because the eldery people would not manage all expenses with their own money when they are after getting old so, the government should be aided.\n\nOn the one hand, the oldery people have been working when they were young while they  were being contributed to the society development such as workforce. The ministry should turn thank to these kinds people how will provide monetary subsidies for their expenses. Moreover, nowadays all goods price are increased dramatically compare to past days so, the pension people are able to face trouble to fulfill their needs and wants.

    "essay": "In this fast changing mordern era, every age-group need certain facilities for their survival. Although half the population believes that people should get government support after retirement,on the contrary, feels that they want everyone to save money for their future while they are working. I will shine on both sides. In my opinion, taking care of old people is important for society and government.\n\nTo accompany, there are many reasons why some people consider against providing facilities such as financial help to retirees. First, the government can introduce more development projects that help improve the economy and development of the country rather than giving people beneficial services after retirement. For example, the latest studies prove that many nations ban facilities after retirement and focus more on developing valuable public projects. In addition, it is seen that sometimes relatives or others cheat on retired people to get money for their service. This is why some people may not get these benefits\n\nOn the contrary, nowadays, due to more competition in every field, survival has become relatively difficult. First and foremost, after a certain age, people lose their physical strength and are unable to do labor work such as working as a laborer in factories and drivers etc. Therefore, in this situation they need financial support for basic needs of home, shoes, clothes and food etc. Additionally, in today's world, there are some sons and daughters who leave their parents alone, the government needs to build more old age homes where they get proper basic needs and care. Even the rapidly increasing cost of living and food items adversely affects older people who do not have sufficient savings.\n\nTo demolish the whole notion, I gather that retired people contributed their lives for the development of society. Therefore, after retirement, it is the duty of society and government to take care of these people and ensure their better survival",

For instance , in the year ,2020 the whole world faced the COVID-19 pandemic which had an impact on the nation.

To substantiate it, I would like to quote an epitome that a recent survey revealed that overall 0.5 million money has been spent on the research related to useless subjects. Furthermore, if this money has been spent on science subjects, it had had great impact on education welfare.\n\nUndoubtedly, there are other factors related to some subjects such as not all students are interested in science subject.

This kind of celebrities can inspire youth to develop their talents through persistent and being diligent to their succeed.\n\nIn conclusion, while there some celebrities have a negative impact on youngers, I believe that there are other celebrities who are examples of hard work and determination and they are a great role model for young people.",

    "essay": "In contemporary years,  most  celebrities have started gaining immense fame for their physical attractions and their properties, and this trend sends a wrong message to  young people who are inspired by celebrities' life stories. I agree that these kinds of celebrities are not  proper role models for ordinary people and in this essay, I will explain the ill effects.\n\nTo begin with, usually people strive to be rich or attractive to draw attention and celebrities promote this attitude which leads to  dire consequences. Firstly, it makes underprivileged youngsters disappointed as they are not able to live and pay like a famous person, and then they may  be motivated to commit a crime to earn  huge money to experience a wealthy lifestyle. According to a recent article published by Times magazine, 80% of criminals who are under 18 years old, had a great intention to show off and make and they strive to impress  their friends with their cars and money.\n\nSecondly, if teenagers take them as a role model and start imitating, society will face numerous issues as most of the community values and nonprofit activities will be dismissed due to the fact that people evaluate everything by its margin and do not weigh works which are crucial to support different people who are in need.  For example, in  recent ,decades most nonprofit organization in Iran are dealing with the problem of lacking volunteers as the new generation only follow well-paid jobs. \n\nIn conclusion, it is true that popular people are known for their pleasing appearance and a huge source of money and they are becoming improper idols for young people as it makes people disappointed and increase social activities' popularity.",

    "essay": "In the modern era, influential individuals are under the limelight for their lifestyle and money rather than milestones achieved by them however, it's causing a negative impact on the younger generation. I strongly agree with the statement. This essay will delineate the supporting details. \n\nTo begin with, the uttermost point would be social media, as it has been playing a crucial role in influencing youngsters. Easier access to the outer world in seconds have led to becoming even closer in the life of famous people such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. For instance, from a decent technology has immensely surged up along with modes of communication and connecting to one another. Teenagers can look into the glittering life of celebrities on internal sites on a daily basis, which they try to intimidate, regardless of the amount of cash spent on those products, clothes, phones, watches and shoes. \n\nFurthermore, choosing an incorrect field of interest for a career could be a significant point. The mesmerizing world of influential masses could manipulate the future goals of youngsters although, not everyone could fit in the requirements such as being able to act in front of a camera. However, this could destroy the chances of becoming a professional in some other fields. \n\nTo conclude, children get affected by the glamorous lifestyle of celebrities and lead them to spend more funds on anonymous stuff also, this might indulge adolescents to decide their career just to get the extraordinary life which, might not turn into their favour most of the time.",

    "essay": "In the present days, some people obey that a notable person receiving prosperity without the appropriate and sufficient efforts. Therefore, this phenomenon has sparked heated debates among individuals for the excessive acquirement of the celebrities that obtain the reputation without a proper performance and contributes to a bad role model among young adults. In my opinion, I totally disagree with this statement and in order to receive a reputation its required large efforts from the celebrity themselves.\nTo begin with, to become a public figure, the celebrity must provide the large effort as well as performance for having spots in the society. Besides, it required great talent and potential to become remarkable and noticeable. As a result, their potential is sufficient for having a large achievement and fulfilment. Moreover, adolescents will imitate their actions and keen to obtain this achievement, thus the celebrities set a positive mindset among teenagers. For instance, young people nowadays willing to become successful and they put the notable person as a role model and follow their path to obtain the prosperity.\nSecondly, the accomplishment of the talented people brought children to desire for the satisfaction in their own lives. Children will start imitating the movement of their lovesâ ones. For example, enrolling in an extra course, such as dancing or acting classes. Consequently, children obtain a potential and make use of their leisure time instead of spending too prolonged time doing a wasteful activity. In addition, children, who have special skills will acquire an extra amount of salary.\nTo conclude, a celebrity, who have obtained an accomplishment and reputation, is worthwhile for their performance. Besides, this achievement sets a positive development for the children to develop themselves to achieving a glamour and prosperous like an artist.",

    "essay": "These days famous people are known for their beauty and richness than accomplishments. While some believe such behaviour negatively affects youngsters, I feel it all depends on the individual and the person he/she follows. \nTo begin, many sportsmen have made the nation proud by winning competitions at the global level. These athletes did not achieve success overnight but through continuous learning, persistence and hard work. Imitating such achievers will help juveniles to carve out their own path and achieve success in the long term. For instance, Sachin Tendulkar, a cricketer who is known best for his batting skills and not for his net worth. Idolising such a cricketer could be beneficial because his way to success was purely hard work and perseverance.\nHowever, there are some celebrities who are popular for their looks and hi-fi lifestyle that they display in public. These usually become a star because of their family background or by wrongdoings. Since they lack talent and patience, they tend to depend on their family members.  Bollywood for example, many actors are seen nowadays are the children of businessman and they are famous for their luxurious living and spending. Since they do not have to accomplish anything, they post pictures of their lifestyle on social media to gain attention. Copying the behaviour of such personalities will merely ruin a childâs \nlife.\nIn conclusion, young people tend to follow famous persons by imitating them.

I completely admit to the fact that, now a days, young people are being intrigued by the attractiveness and lavish life of popular people in society which is leading to build a wrong perception and attitude towards the real definition of success in life.  \n\nIn order to start with, firstly there are many celebrities who are famous because of their looks and attractiveness and their behavior often has an adverse influence on the teenagers. They send out the message that in order to be popular, they have to be rich and beautiful. There are some who do not even mind in engaging acts which are disgraceful only to grab attention of the society and media. For example, Sanjay Bhatt who is a film star, famous for his wealth and glamour got involved in anti-social element acts, addicted to drugs and went to prison.  This gives bad example to the society and his fans. \n\nSecondly celebrities often represents as a brand ambassador and endorses commercial branded products which earns them lot of money and popularity.  This eventually grab the attention of young people who follows them in various platforms like Facebook, twitter, instagram etc. In addition to this people claim themseleves as fans of those celebrities and try to imitate their life style with out realizing their efforts and hard work to become an celebrity. \n\nI would like to conclude here that the young people should not blindly follow their celebrities and built an perception about life however they should realize that celebrities wont earn money and fame with out putting any efforts.

I partially agree with this statement which I will explain in this following paragraph.\n\nOn the one hand, in this contemporary world, there are various sophisticated things such as gadget which could affect the immature persons through its widespread information of entertainment. This will reflect unpleasant sample for them, since, some news is usually informing unsuitable matter for their age. Thus, they know that how to be a famous is only by performing their charming and wealth that is truly wrong idea. As an entertainer, many aspects that should be considered properly to perform their talent, for instance, receiving a reward annually for their best acting could motivate younger to effort their future. Besides, they also could be having a right attitude by giving a donation to either reform or charitable institution. \n\nOn the other hand, although they have a great emission, it is better to spend it for the philanthropy instead of private necessity. However, conversely, some artists are likely to show their wealth through their glamour and branded accessories, items and accomodation in some cases. As a result, this will lead to the controversial issues among society and impact to the discrepancy social. The probability is that their figure is on the top which will be easily affecting most people especially to the teenagers.

This can not be assured that the celebrities could give a good example for them.\n\nBy way of conclusion, it is true that showing a good behaviour is pivotal things for the youthful to be a good individual. From my viewpoint, it is most agreeable to the entertainment company for leading the artists to be more polite and altruistically in front of the public due to the uncontrollable emotional of younger.",

For this reason, it is argued that they represent a negative model to the new generations. This essay totally agree with this view.\n\nIn the past, it use to be crucial to be either talented or percistent to reach fame. Because the spots available in the media were extremely escarce, people had to work hardly and prove their value to deserve that space among the stars. For example, only professionals such as actors, singers, politicians and soccerplayers which had an out-standing carees were famous at that time. As a result, young people use to understand high performance as an asset to acheive sucssess and eventually mirror it. \n\nNevertheless, this scenary has dramactly changed with the advance of technology.

Usually, these people become wealthy only by promoting business and brands to their audience.

    "essay": "In modern society, some people believe that the government should financially support the retired, ageing population while others think they should be able to be financially independent. I believe that the government should definitely support retired workers, especially the ones who have had a larger impact on the countryâs well-being.\n\nThere is no denying that most people have a rough idea on when they would like to retire so planning in advance and having the ability to save money for their future is a big reason why the government shouldnât pay. Therefore, it would make sense for the government to refuse financial support in this case. However, many jobs on minimum wage, especially the oneâs directly involved with the government, do not make enough money to save for retirement. As a result, they would need extra support financially.\n\nNow to why the government should pay, there are multiple reasons. One of them being that many individuals pay taxes and have jobs that they can only sustain during their younger years. For example, soldiers working in the army retire younger and find themselves jobless after retirement. Not to mention how much they sacrifice for their country, only to be left with nothing as soon as they finish their service. As far as taxes are concerned, most of the money that the public spend, many of them never see the impact it has on the country. \n\nIn conclusion, the government should aim to implement schemes that give back to some of the most valuable members of our society. Without them, the country would struggle to function effectively. To give them nothing in return is a disgrace to the government.",

Furthermore,after the children's marriage,they will be separated by them and live the         remaining life lonely.The Asian countries are prime examples, about 80% of the aged populations are tend to live separately.\n\nDespite the above arguments, I am of the view that local governance gives more priority to the aged population. Indeed, one reason why I believe is that the older generation people are mostly retired from their profession and spend rest of life lonely.Additionally, many people do have medical complications as becoming older and older. Consequently, the medicines are quite expensive now a day's which is not affordable for them. To illustrate, the New York Times published an  article about the survival of elders in this contemporary era. As a result, there is a  shortage of monthly income and ministry could lend their hands for them. \n\nIn conclusion, while both views are held in society and I strongly believe that ministry support as much as needed for them. This is because of elders facing difficulties with lower annual income and medical expenses. Given this situation, it is recommended that in order to care for older people, government around the world should think about implementing this form of support.",

    "essay": "In many developing countries such as India, it is evident that there is a constant increase in the population, especially the younger generation which is under 15 years of age. The rise in population will have a greater impact on the short term and long term which will be advantageous in the former while disadvantageous in the latter. This essay discusses both the current and future implications of this scenario.\n\nWith the recent lockdowns enforced by the government, owing to the pandemic situation, the families had to stay at home which has resulted in a new society called  the COVID generation. The immediate impact because of this is an increase in sales of the child care products and their associated market. Secondly, a recent trend in the photography industry for the newborns has paved the path for a new industry. Finally, as most of the parents are working, they prefer to send their kids to the daycare centres which are now available at every corner of the street. Though there is a number of new ventures emerging due to the existing situation that increases the revenue of the government, there will be a serious impact on the economy in the future that is worrisome.\n\nWhen these millennials grow older, there will be a huge impact on the democracy's economy. An increase in the population indicates that the number of jobs required in the forthcoming years will be high. In addition to this, there will be a depletion in natural resources, the agricultural lands are converted into complexes to accommodate the growing population which in turn will make the country dependent on imported goods for the livelihood  would result in inflation. With fewer jobs and more cost of living, the crime rates across the nation will increase.\n\nTo conclude, though the increase in the number of births helps certain countries' economies bloom at the moment, there will be a severe impact in the near future if proper steps are not taken by the authorities in charge. The State and Central parties must plan effectively to meet the needs of their population and the economy.",

    "essay": "In some countries, the number of young people who are under 15 years old has a significant rise in recent years. In my opinion, this trend would influence the current and future times of these countries both in negative and positive ways.\n\nHaving more young people would bring various impacts on society such as allocation of educational resources and job opportunities. Firstly, if public schools have full enrollment, parents would have to send their children to private schools. This means parents need to pay higher tuition fees than the cost of going to public schools. It could largely increase the economic burdens for childrenâs families. Secondly, in the coming decades, it might be more challenging for these young people to secure jobs, especially when governments have trouble in offering sufficient job positions.\n\nMeanwhile, a larger population of youth may also bring advantages to the nations. On the one hand, in order to ease the current pressure, governments need to invest more money in infrastructure, including public transportation, sports facilities, and school construction. This could create a better environment for teenagers. On the other hand, the younger generation tends to be energetic and creative, which is a useful source of innovation and evolution for their own countries. Therefore, a nation would be more advanced in the upcoming years by having more youngsters.\n\nIn general, when there are more young citizens who are aged 15 and younger in some nations, it has not only drawbacks but also benefits in the present and future time.",

This phenomenon would bring prominent impacts to those countries, both in short term and in long term. \n\nThe great proportion of young people will aggravate the burden of nurture in short term. More children could make the burden of education much heavier and could negatively affect the living standard of families currently. To rise more kids, parents have to work harder to earn more and devote budgets, which would be spent on consuming food and beverage, to childrenâs care and education. Additionally, the government would also spend more financial resources on constructing more schools and hospitals to cater the growth of youngsters, which could result in imbalanced development of different sectors of economy and society. Moreover, teachersâ workloads would be overwhelming since teachers have to take care more students now than before. \n\nOn the other hand, the increasing percentage of teens will bring several benefits to the whole society in long term. Teens will become suitable candidates for the job market when they become adults, which provide more workforces to the industries. Great workforces would generate abundant outputs and boost growth of economy. Moreover, the number of innovations and inventions could be enlarged when more kids grow up and well-educated, since great proportion of teens means great probability of emergence of experts and innovators. \n\nHowever, the increasing percentage of teens might cause troubles to the eco-system in long term.

Therefore, the environment may face serious threat of contamination. \n\nTo sum up, the growth of teen population would bring significant impacts to those countries, both in positive and negative sides.",

    "essay": "Past few decades have seen a dramatic change in old age home due to lack of communication and lack of closeness among family members. Old people nowadays are facing loneliness and also they are weak as well as unfit. In this following essay I aim to identify some causes of this problem and some viable solutions.\n\nFirst of all, the significant reason of the problem is the nuclear family. The trend of living in a nuclear family is increasing day by day moderately. People prefer independent life and cannot tolerate any kind of boundation in their personal matter so they try to maintain distance along theirs grandparents and elder one. Moreover, Retirement is also a reason, after getting its people loss their network of friends, they feel lonely and isolate. Somewhere they found themselves as a burden on family because that time they unable to do any work and face financial problem.\n\nFurthermore, with passing age they not able to talk and listen to someone because of age factor and their weak body. No one available to look after them in their own family who can give them food on time . They think freedom has been lost and become everything this cause they suffer from stress and other physical issues. \n\nIn order to solve this problem, people should have to change their thoughts about nuclear family and they can choose to joint family as well as time and attention should be given. They have to keep in mind and never forget that one day will be coming when they also face with the same time and age. Change matters a lot so we should change ourself first then stop treating them as a burden and start treating them as a head and most significant member of the family.\n\nIn gist, we all are responsible for that because we are adopting Western culture. If it goes on, then one day we will also find themselves in old age home and suffer with the same problem",

    "essay": "The administrator gets a higher income than normal workers in the company, some believe that the directors deserved the high salaries, and others argue that there should be the same criterion for all the staff. This essay will examine both sides of the argument, and present my opinion in the end.\n\nOne of the reasons for the high salaries of managers is that they undertake more risk to the organization. Directors are responsible for dealing with the crisis of the company, which ordinary workers don't have to do. For example, directors must make necessary methods to save the company from the inflation problem. Therefore, the more responsibility managers have, the more money they should get.\n\nThe main reason that people think the gap between directors and workers is unfair must be they think they work for the company as hard as those directors as well and are also a crucial part of the business. It is no doubt that a company is unable to run without those ordinary workers. For example,  a car company will go bankrupt as soon as possible if all the assembly workers strike. Thus, it is reasonable that ordinary workers should get the same pay as their managers.\n\nIn my opinion, directors should be paid more than workers because they have more responsibility and risk to face. When the company breaks down, the workers can easier to find another job if their skills are professional enough, but as for directors, they need more fortune to pay the mortgage and loan coming with bankruptcy, and they also need more foundation to restart their business.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that directors of organizations deserve higher salaries than ordinary workers. Because managers always have more responsibilities to make strategies and plans for the company's future carefully, even a small mistake will ruin the whole business possibly, though those workers also play an important role in the company.",

    "essay": "Stepping into the 21st century, the governments are investing a great deal of money for their competitors to participate in global competitions. One can subscribe to a paradox is the authorities should spend money on the children to join in sports. I concur with the idea that there will be a host of benefits of countries focus on children to join in sports. \nFirst of all, spending money on children will be a facilitator of training successful athletes in the future. It is evident that if children are trained at the early age, they will show up their talents and get competitive experiences before taking global competitions. For instance, Anh Vien, who was a swimmer competitor at the Olympics, spent her childhood on practicing swimming with national tutors. As a result, she achieved the gold medal in her main field for her country, Vietnam. \nApart from it, financial support on children is the main contributor to the extent of the countryâs sports. If the children have the opportunities to take part in sports, the home country sport background will be extended. Therefore, the number of children who participate in sport will see an increase due to the support from governments. \nIn the light of these facts, I nurture the opinion that investing money should be spent on children to play sports owing to the fact that this will bring about many advantages for those countries. If nations merely focus on competitors who are currently playing their parts in worldwide games, the number of people who can take part in sports will alleviate at certain times because of the lack of athletes.",

    "essay": "For some time now, it is a controversial aspect that high positions in huge organizations should make higher wages than other ordinary workers or not. Some people argue that it is unnecessary but others claim it is fair enough. In this essay, I will elaborate on two different views and my own.\n\nThe supporters of high salaries positions assert the social responsibility of directors of large cooperations. When it comes to the positions, it is not only a spot for work but a position that takes all of the significant responsibilities toward society. For example, Bill Gates, the former executive of Microsoft is well-known as a person who makes affordable efforts to lead positive influence on the public as a leader and literary has acted to fulfil his social duties to the world. Moreover, most people in high positions took a tertiary education. This means, they can be called an expert in their own fields. As a professional, it is obvious that they deserve to have higher salaries than others.  Samsung cooperation in Korea organized promotion sectors as employees' education level and to get promoted as a CEO or vice president it is inevitable that they take compulsory education courses in particular organizations.\n\n      \n\nOn the other hand, the opponents point out the polarization of wealth. If it is allowed to the public it has a high possibility to divide social grades more severely. The USA where well known for the huge gap in terms of positions has suffered from unbalanced wealth leading to violent demonstrations in 2018. Furthermore, higher salaries for a few directors could draw undermine the morale of the others. According to research implemented in China, more than 95% of China citizens feel a sense of deprivation in terms of the gigantic gap in salaries between them and people in high positions.\n\nIn conclusion, I reckon that the huge difference in wages according to positions impacts people negatively such as the polarization of wealth and drawing undermine morale. However, we also should be aware of the directors' burden of social responsibilities and expertise from the tertiary education they received.",

    "essay": "It is often claimed by some people that it is not fair for the head of the corporations to receive wages which are so much higher than the ones that the employees do, while others believe this is vital. In this essay, I will explain both sides and show my personal view. \n\nOn the one hand, there are those who take a stance that it is unfair for the workers to earn smaller wages. This is because a company can only prosper with the hardwork of several employees who dedicate their lifes to their jobs. As a matter of fact, these people frequently work long hours until exhaustion, whilst the directors of the organizations have a flexible schedule. According to this view, it is a complete injustice that the ordinary workers are not as well-paid as their bosses.\n\nOn the other hand, since company owners invest a high amount of money and dedication when they decide to run a business, it is reasonable that they earn much more than their employees. As an illustration of this, there are hundreds of entrepreneurs who spend countless years saving up money and learning the skills to build up an organization. Moreover, directors have a huge responsibility of coordinating the workforce which is an incredible difficult task. Therefore, the high salaries are compatible with the effort they have made to create and comand a corporation. \n\nIn conclusion, even though employees are a fundamental part of every companyâs success, it seems to me that the directors are entitled to higher salaries as they have put a lot of effort and money into the business as well as they are responsible for entire the workforce.",

    "essay": "A group of people consensus that  scientists have ultimate importance worldwide; whereas, others argue that legislator has a higher impact. Therefore, ahead of my stance, both the viewpoints would be discussed.\n\nExamining the former opinion, the first argument the proponents put forward is that Scientists bring about revolutionary innovations. In other words, the intellectuals from this fraternity have been responsible for all the groundbreaking discoveries and inventions in the history of mankind such as Telephone, Internet, and Computers. This has had an immense influence on the general public and their standard of living leading to a convenient and hassle-free life. Moreover,  technological advancement is attributed to the scientist. To elaborate, every sphere of human life namely agriculture, defence, manufacturing, education, and commerce has been benefited by the augmentation of science and technology. If there were no scientists, the humans would have primitive rudimentary lifestyle today.\n\nHowever, the opponents of this view assert that Politician has more dominance in the world. Mainly, for their law-making power. This is to say that political candidates form legislative and policies that affect bourgeois and elite alike, not to mention the businesses. Also, the parliamentarians control the budget. This means the majority of the world is democratic and the authorities have to sovereignty to allocate funds in a particular field. As a result, the entire community is affected directly on indirectly. For example, as per research, the main politicians of the 5 biggest economies can impact the whole world with their decisions.\n\nTo conclude and give my opinion, I support the former viewpoint to a great extent. Politicians have certain democratic power in the world; nonetheless, the intellectual supremacy held by Scientists has had more influence over the world.",

    "essay": "These days as the population is increasing at an unprecedented pace, the housing shortage has become one of the main consequences. It is concerned whether it is an obligation of the government to alleviate this issue or whether the nation is responsible for the lack of accommodation. I firmly believe that both parties should integrate and contribute to the solutions. \n\nTo begin with, there is ample evidence that sustainable housing is strongly due to government regulations. That is to say, political houses should establish certain restrictions on the numbers of people and land that is distributed to each citizen. For instance, a recent survey has revealed that 25 countries had a scarcity of land to construct new houses because of the fact that government didn't allocate the land properly and residents were prone to build large houses in order to outperform one another, which later caused housing shortages in multifold metropolitan cities. \n\nSecondly, it is explicit that because of the nation's unprofitable purchase of lands and housing facilities, it has become prevalent to some citizens to inevitably live in flats and accommodations. It can be solved by public organisations that can share and divide some houses, which indicates that the government is not fully liable for such an issue. For example, several cities concluded that this problem is partly due to people's actions, 45 per cent of which could solve this problem by uniting both the government and the nation. \n\nTo conclude, it can be clearly seen that I strongly advocate that it is not only feasible for the government to come up with a solution, but also citizens of the city are able to resolve the scarcity of housing.",

    "essay": "It can not be denied that population growth  is a major issue in the metropolitan area. The extension of the citizens is contrary to the broadening of the residential area that has limited land to build and it will lead to a housing crisis phenomenon and council should be concerned about this problem. I strongly believe the statement and some consideration regarding my attitude will be elaborated in this essay.\n\nFirst of all, the authority should create a comprehensible regulation  with respect to public migration. The escalation of inhabitants in the capital caused by people from urban areas moving to the city. These urbanization purposes have a different background that mainly comes with trying to get a decent job.The regime should be aware of this issue and create strict rules to decrease the trend or alternatively create a lot of established employment activity in urban areas. Secondly,  a dense population will increase the scarcity of living in houses or apartments. As the society expands while the land still remains, it will bring on the lack of residential areas. The living costs are intended to be expensive whereas the salary is still constant and is not the best possible situation. Following that previous reason, it will affect the index of happiness rate (causing stress, depression, and anxiety) since people tend to secure a job and do the hard work to pay the rent. In addition, if the occupant rate  reaches a certain peak point there will be a mess and chaos happens such as an extreme shortage situation and unemployment.\n\nAlthough another assumption said that it can be helped by authority to give subvention for accommodation, it is not feasible to only rely on that solution and it will not overcome the problem at all.  However, it  only fits as a temporary explanation.\n\nTo conclude, the shortage of housing areas is a major problem in populated cities, and authorities should have serious regulations regarding this problem to create a better place to live.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, buying a house has been getting unaffordable in developed cities. Some believe that only government could make adjustments to the housing supply,  and I strongly agree with this opinion and will explore it in the following paragraphs.\n\nFirstly, the critical reason for the overwhelming housing market is that both federal and provincial authorities have established policies to boost the economy in big cities. Consequently, those policies created abundant working opportunities in those areas, which promote young adults immigrating from their hometowns. For instance, the head offices of most companies are located in Toronto, which causes many university graduates to flush into Toronto for better pay and to settle down there. \n\nSecondly, the provincial government could build some more condos and townhouses instead of detached houses. Although living in a condo or townhouse does not have enough space as living in a detached house, it is an ideal method to satisfy the increasing demands of new houses. By doing so, it is also avoidable that lots of parks and farmlands would be turned into buildings. For example, in downtown Toronto, many old houses have been replaced by skyscrapers, which has been increasing the living capacity of this city and saving green belts for relaxation.\n\nAdmittedly, there are some other ways to help remit the housing shortage too, such as working at home and getting a job in small towns. But by the above measures, the housing problems can not be solved permanently. \n\nIn conclusion, big companies also can help resolve housing problems through online work, but I believe that only the government can regulate the housing market by making different policies, like new job creation and approval of condo building plans.",

    "essay": "Some today argue that only governments are capable of countering problems in cities resulting from housing shortages. In my opinion, although governments should be the primary actors, human beings can also offer aid.\n\nOn the one hand, only governments have the authority to enact truly large-scale change. Governments by design make decisions for the benefit of the entire citizenry. An example of how this could relate to housing issues would be the urban planning in New York City over the century. The authorities there had to contend with an unprecedented population surge in a limited urban area. They responded by building skyscrapers that could house many residents, expanding public transport, and constructing various highways to allow commuters to live nearby the city. These solutions could only have been successfully undertaken at the behest of the government.\n\nHowever, though the role of individuals is less prominent, it still exists. In the previous example, voters in New York City were able to make their voices heard by voting for mayors and governors that best served them. In the event that the government is not addressing housing problems sufficiently, then citizens can write to their representatives, organize protests, or take more drastic action such as relocating to a new city. In the era of social media, it is now more possible than ever before for the average person to openly discuss these issues. People will always find methods to pressure governments, including in areas related to housing.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with those who contend only government action can improve housing issues in major metropolitan areas as individuals can collectively always engender some degree of reform.

    "essay": "Housing shortage in cosmopolitan cities can be attributed to two main factors: insufficient supply of residentials areas and rapid surge of population. The government, having the highest authority, has a pivotal role in regulating supply of houses to citizens. Thus, I firmly believe it is only through government led movement that alleviation of the problem could be realised.\n\nSome may propose that land developers and citizens have a role in aggravating the housing problems: developers can accelerate the process of building housing estates, while citizens can move to areas further away from city centre to reduce the congestion. Of course, these would rely on their conscience, which is often lacking. Who wouldnât want to live in the proximity of their workplace or school, with all the shops and daily necessities in place? My friend, for instance, prefered to live in Sydney in a tiny flat as she felt it was extremely convenient, rather than go back to suburban areas which was remote and isolated. With the governmentâs policy in place, giving monetary incentives or welfare rewards to those who comply with increasing residential supply, the scheme would be much more efficient.\n\nIt is crystal clear that the government has the highest power to enact changes in society. They can design policies to ensure adequate supply of land is provided for residential use, as well as putting a limit to the population rise, therefore reaching a balance between man and space. Singapore is a glaring example, where the authorities have put together reasonably priced and spacious public housing estates for its citizens in the past decades, relieving the pressure on living space. Hong Kong, on the contrary, without such large scale public housing plans in place, finds itself constantly lacking in quality apartments to house the needy. \n\nWithout the officials led change, it is extremely difficult and inefficient to ease the pressure on housing supply. Therefore, in my opinion, government support and action is the only way out for the paucity of living areas in large urban areas.",

Some argue that only government is the appropriate authority to deal with this rising problem. I strongly agree with this argument as the government can solve this growing issue by various steps, such as restricting the new landed residential housing by encouraging vertical apartment buildings and gradually expanding the city.\n\nFirst and foremost, the government is the only appropriate authority to resolve this housing crisis issue by discouraging the building of new landed houses and encouraging vertical multi-storey apartment living with proper planning and infrastructure to deal with this space crunch. For example, Singapore and Hong Kong are the cities on an island, they have proven to solve this crisis for their citizens by vertically building thousands of high-floor flats. These cities have proved to have the best infrastructure for their ever-growing population by building multi-story apartments rather than new houses, which has resulted in economically affordable housing for their citizens in big cities. Further, to help the situation government can extend highways to help commuters access the city easily. This high level of planning can only be done by the government to help solve the accommodation shortages for their citizenry.\n\nSecondly, the government can help this situation by expanding the cities and creating more residential properties on the outskirts of the city. In the Noida, for instance,  a fast-growing city in India, the housing development board has continuously helped accommodate the growing population by building more residential properties on the outskirts of the city which eventually became part of the city and built metros and highways for commuters to make the city easily accessible. Hence, this helped in controlling growing cramping and accommodation problems for their locals. \n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that government has a big role to play as an ultimate authority by taking appropriate measures to create highly planned inner-by city development and well-designed infrastructure to accommodate the growing needs  of their citizens.",

One of the most effective ways to control over the expenditure of the house is to deter the greedy speculators or property developers from flipping homes, more preciselyï¼ the vacancy rate could be greatly reduced when governmental interruption works. \n\nMoreover, governments are supposed to strengthen the supervision over real estate developers so that it helps to stop those illicit merchants from disrupting the regular economic orders.

For example, goverments will fine real estate agencies if they overcharge in the amount of price to live in the city, Therefore, real estate agencies would provide a reasonable price to sale. Furthermore, another thing goverments can do is to provide financial supportted who buy housing in the city .

For example, children who get illness can use zoom application, so that he/she could following the class from home or hospital. Needless to say, technology have a amazing power too change the learning method. On the other hand, it also will raise a question: are students get the best education through this new method?\n\nOnline learning cannot achieve a comprehensive result as what school could achieve. \n\nStudents aiming for the improvement in knowledge and attitude, where they could learn it best from school, through an intensive interaction with teachers and friends.  For instance, by having a direct interaction, children could feel a real affection which would affect their personal and academic decelopment.  It is possible for children to feel less happy and less motivated because they will not see or play with their peer. Therefore, a school existance is crucial in term to fulfill the essentials goal of education. \n\nIn conclusion, the old and new method are need to fill each other gap. Learning virtually could be done for certain purposes, yet the classroom still the main education media.",

    "essay": "It is thought by some that a university education is a stepping stone to building up a lucrative  employment status in life, while other groups believe that getting a job directly after school discipline is the better option . Although tertiary studies can reinforce the future race development of an individual .In my opinion , I affirm that  interested students must be promoted to start working straight away after acquiring their basic education.Let us discuss this in detail in the subsequent paragraphs.\n\nTo begin with, let us shed light on the argument that higher study is crucial for a better future. First and foremost, most professionals are highly qualified. In addition, the doctors, engineers or whoever decorating the higher positions in  society are well qualified with graduation and post-graduation certificates  that made them  lead  successful and satisfactory careers in their lives. For example, in India, the staff members of the schools are categorised as principals, teachers, administrators and other lower-grade positions  based on their academic qualifications which include the level of their degrees that helped them to create a successful pathway.\n\nOn the other hand, there are certain points to support the decision to work without university qualifications. Primarily, personal skills are the building blocks of a successful staff member in his organisation. Moreover, leadership qualities, time management, emotional intelligence and collaboration and cooperation among a team play a crucial role in the achievements of a staff member. For instance, the success of the Microsoft company is the patience and leadership qualities of Bill Gates rather than his tertiary qualifications.\n\nIn conclusion, the overall development of a successful course is the subtotal of educational certificates and the innate characteristics of an individual. In my point of view, the factors behind a rewarding career are decided by the personal interest of a person whether he or she is affiliated with studies or would like to cultivate their personal  skills.",

    "essay": "It is believed that there are two feasible routes to move on your academic career. Compared to getting into a university which possibly raise students' success, applying for a job after high school graduation benefits school-leavers to some extent. In my opinion, studying at university place a firm background for job appliants. This essay will elaborate both viewpoints and illumiate writer's opinion. \n\n    Attending to a university could benefit the young in favour of knowledge and promotion. In other words, university provides students with several academic lectures, which acts as a prerequisite for recruitment. For example, most of young newcomers to John Hunting have a university degree as the first impression to their interviewers. Moreover, if young employees have an academic qualification, therein lies a potential promotion, so they can receive more salary. For instance, managers in many big companies are the excellent graduate; therefore, they receive a bundle of money to their best ability. Personally, continuing a study process is a firm foundation for those who long for reputation and remunerative job.     \n\n   However, the appearance of vocational school has grown as a recent trend for the young who have no momentum to vie for university. These teenagersâ similarity is to gain work experience sooner than students sitting in a university. Therefore, they are capable of bearing workplace pressure since they have been working for a long period since the graduation of students. For example, many teenagers choose to work at a babershop or business vendor for the ability of endurance. Plus, they create a connection with the community in order to open their friend circle. It is possible to get a job at an early age to expand your friend network since you have to meet other people. Taking some footballers in Vietnam as an example, they do not get into a university yet they improve their sport skills then play for their regional team. As a result, they have a multitude of relationships.\n\n   In conclusion, both university and society could teach you much information and challenge your competency. As an exponent of academic institution, I ascertain that university plays an essential role in orientation and self-improvement.",

    "essay": "There is a prevailing debate regarding career advancement. Some argue for education and pre-employment studies, however, others state for swiftly obtaining employment after school graduation. While both perspectives hold merit, I wholeheartedly opine that education is essential for certain professions that require a solid foundation.\n\nIt is widely recognised that occupations such as law, human rights and arbitration courts require personal achievements during academic years. To delve deeper, nowadays, to get in beginner expert position in public services, diplomas, skill certificates and other educational qualifications are required. Moreover, for undergraduates in order to work in fabrics, mining and constructing industries, they have to be proven by lifeguarding internship committees, as health and labour safety is paramount. For example, according to the latest news, in the Tengiz Shevr oil facility, during the construction of an facility, 3 teenagers died due to a lack of knowledge of health and labour.\n\nConcerning getting a job promptly, is beneficial for specialities such as managers, marketers, sales and others. Communication abilities and logical structure in sales are not included in the curriculum in either universities or colleges, as they develop work experience and practical application. For instance, when i was working as a PR manager in an advanced corporation, to reach entry level, I passed one-month internship, despite the fact that I did not have any experience. Moreover, I have improved my advertising manners and have seen an improved career. However, after a while, when i wanted to switch to another position, my bachelor's degree diploma was required.\n\nTo conclude, every civilised society has to learn new things. Educational facilities is the only place where you can obtain them. Yes, you can literally get a job after graduation, but some public service specialities require diplomas.",

This essay attempts to shed light on both perspectives before concluding that I am in favor of the latter notion.\n\nOn one hand, it is true that studying at a higher educational institution is one of the best ways to succeed. Firstly, university graduates tend to receive decent salaries. This is because they have equipped themselves with basic knowledge related to their career, which helps them to easily tackle unexpected problems and increase work productivity. Secondly, job seekers with a degree have higher chances to be selected into companies. For instance, several firms who have powerful impacts in Vietnamâs business tend to hire bachelor degree holders since they are trained in an academic environment for a quality time.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a host of compelling reasons as to why I am convinced that seeking for an occupation after graduating is also advantageous. The first reason is people will become more mature and independent. Having a well-earned job gives youngsters opportunities to become financially stable, this means that they can invest in themselves and help their family. Another reason is that they can be promoted easier.

So I believe that, graduates should learn more practical knowledge because it helps student have communication skills and be more confident in their imminent life.\n\nThe first idea, is to supports students to gain work experience, which will ultimately lead to a good position in a company after a period of time when they have more good qualifications. Furthermore, the students that spend time working, spend time gain experience from working will find employment without any hardship. So a working experiences help student have a good life after graduation, and the unemployment rate will be lower than the rest of the student that didnât spend time working before beginning their university studies.\n\nOn the other hand, some people think that student shouldnât working before start university course. People believe that their children would spend more time on their university education and the students mustnât work to gain experiences. They think if their child working, it will affect to the academic achievement of their children. When the students graduate, the employment rate is 50/50, the student can get a job if they have enough confidence, qualifications and communication skills. And if students donât have those skills, the unemployment ratios will be higher.\n\nIn short, that is my true believe, a lot of qualifications without real life experience is completely worthless.

Actual cases and problems are the best teachers especially, for a junior person who wants to enrol. To make it clear let me continue with an example. Imagine a situation where you face a communication problem with a business team and your issue is how to get answers to your requests. You can back to your books and search for various methods to communicate with humans and then try each of them to get the result. But what is the best solution in that place? It is better if you have several experiences about this issue at work and as a result of that, you know how to have particular behaviours with diverse communities. According to that example, I believe that having Empirical knowledge is  key  in the business world. In addition to that, there are a lot of benefits in meet different experts in your field. You can learn a lot from them.\n\nSo moving on and talking about the other side, undoubtedly, there is a huge sea of differences between educated people and not educated ones. A lot of changes will happen to a man or woman in the education process about both his or her sides. They have changes in their characters and their behaviour besides  becoming a knowledgeable human. To clarify and as evidence, you can compare two people around you that have or do not have an educational background and think about their treatment with other people. Besides, these certainly, you can not ignore the impacts and needs of a base of academic and well-researched theories and facts to make you able to start a job as an expert. You need a starting point and education gives you the best one.\n\nIn conclusion, probably the best approach is to care about both sides and reinforce each of them at their time to use their pros for any situation. Choosing an academic way or raising your occupation background by getting into a job to progress your career path are both useful but you should make them balance and have all of them.",

In the way, they can become independent, and they will be able to afford things which they love. For example, my young brother went to work as soon as he finished school, and he purchased a motorbike which loves. Secondly, they will be albe to approach to works sooner, and assist they in the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to the jobs which they have chosen.

    "essay": "It is often considered that the masses need to enrol in a university or college to fulfil their dreams by getting respectful job opportunities. Whereas, a few individuals believed that after completing school learning students directly indulge  in the working environment. In my, an inclined well qualification is necessary for a better future and a successful career. Thus, this essay will elaborate on both notions which further leads to a logical conclusion.\n\nCommencing, in modern times, the population size has highly surged which causes competition between individuals hence to fight around such competitive surroundings one must well educational degrees with them. However, the best route to a better life is to have a higher education because organisations always seek knowledge and educational certificates. For example, in India, an enormous number of school-passed aspirants are admitted to colleges because it is believed that a better job can only be achieved when individuals have a perfect amount of knowledge and bachelor's qualification. \n\nMoving further, some people think that they can directly indulge themselves in better jobs although in the contemporary ,era monetary hardship is high which affects the wealth of humans. Therefore, students after completing  school learnings  choose to work and to complete their needs in life. For instance, school-passed-out candidates want to get  early exposure to working life and earn money which would be helpful to them in living a successful life.\n\nIn a nutshell, higher educational knowledge is necessary because technological advancement can only be handled by the technical person. Similarly, after-school work not is useful for survival in the world. In other words, deep subject information is crucial to earning better in life.",

    "essay": "A group of people think, studying or going to school or university has a significant effect on achieving success, while others believe that it is better to get a work straight in comparison with continuing a career in university. In my view, education has more impact on getting a position rather than employment straight after school and I will expose it, in the forthcoming paragraphs.\n\nOn the one hand, with the improvement of countries, competition in getting jobs is increased among people. Due to the fact that I mentioned, educated people have some positive points rather than others. Firstly, most of the positions in companies need academic knowledge about it. For example, when you want to be employed in the technology attitude, it is vital for them to have a related degree in computer science, or when you want to cure people in hospitals it is essential to have a degree in the medical field. Secondly, competition in getting jobs(gaining a career) is extended dramatically. Consequently, having a degree is a very beneficial point to being hired by organizations. For instance, a car manufacturing company chooses a studied person for their tasks in comparison with aperson who(is illustrated in terms of getting access to some technological device) has not  studied. \n\nOn the other hand, getting a straight job after school has some benefits.(being directly employed) Firstly, you can gain profit and money earlier when you start to work faster than someone who studies. As a result, independence is more available in the first stages of life. Secondly, it is important to learn basic(fundamental)subjects in universities. However, most of them are impractical in real life and career and we cannot use them in efficient ways. So, experience is more practical.\n\nIn conclusion, although(remarking career) getting work straight has some benefits such as being independent earlier or gaining more experience in the first steps of a career, the vital role of educating and having a degree cannot be ignored. So in way of my thinking, with education, we have more chances to find an appropriate job and achieve our goals.",

    "essay": "The subject about what should people do after school sparked much debate between individuals. I tend to believe that it is important to apply into university straight after school to get education you need and only later on start working. Other people believe differently. In this essay I will argument both views and explain my opinion.\n\nIt is believed that starting studying at university or college after school is the best way to have a prosperous career. It is that because people donât waste their time working and immediately start to get educated in sphere that they are interested in. That leads to human beings getting enlightened and being able to work in a place which most of the time ensures to have a successful life and profession waiting for them. Another example can be made that it provides students to be more responsible and independent. Convincing argument can be made that it gets individuals face challenges and hard situations which develops problem-solving skills.\n\nIn contrast, some others may claim that it is better to get a job straight after school. For example taking a gap year and getting a job is to understand yourself considering helping realize what humankind wants to do in their life later on. Having a job provides the opportunity to have a steady income that helps to not worry that much about paying for the studies. Therefore, it aids to appreciate money value which encourages to knowing how to be thrifty and economical.\n\nConsidering both views, I would assert that wanting to have a flourishing career others must to finish studies at university or collage after school to build interpersonal skills and have more opportunities facing them in life.",

    "essay": "Much debate has sparked whether spending four or more years at university to get a degree really is better than simply getting a job, like it is commonly believed. In this essay I will present both views and give my personal opinion.\n\nFirstly, working a job is cheaper than studying at university. With rising study costs, one almost always has to take out a student loan, unlike working a normal job. In contrast to studying, where a student must be supported by society, a working person creates that value. The fact that too few people choose the latter path is the chief reason why study prices have risen so dramatically in the last half century. Even after getting a degree, a large fraction of graduates fail to find a stable footing in the industry which their degree is for. These young adults must then struggle with mounting student loan rates. Rather than start studying with no future plan and solid financial backing, it is far more logical to apply for a job instead.\n\n\tSecondly, working provides valuable experience that more and more college students lack. With fiercer and fiercer competition in the job market, employers choose from the best candidates. Simply having a degree just isnât enough and having practical experience is becoming more and more common. What that means is that attaining a degree no longer has such a big advantage when compared to attaining no degree and working. Also, working immediately after finishing school does not mean a person will never get a degree. They can always do it later, after they have gathered the necessary experience and have become financially independent. Enrolling and graduating from a college or university later on is easier as well. Thus, working after graduating high school can set you on a path in life, which you can enhance later on, once enough experience and savings have been accumulated.\n\n\tHowever, studying at a university or college empowers one to achieve higher academic heights. Professor lectures, vast libraries and other academic resources transform a fresh high school graduate into a learned scholar. Some studies have shown that the human brain stops forming at around age 25. This is important because every piece of information is internalized far better until then. That means that while studying at a later date is possible, it does not have the same impact.\n\n\tTo conclude, working at a job does not put strain on the economic system, while studying does somewhat. Attaining a bachelorâs or masterâs degree certainly increases",

    "essay": "In this day and age, it is believed by some that attending university or college is important to future success while others think that students should go to work after finishing high school. Although getting a job after school can have some merits, I personally believe that choosing a university or college is the better option for students after school.\n\nOn the one hand, there are certain benefits of getting a job after graduating from high school. First, this can save time, four years for university and three years for college. Instead of spending three or four years studying at a college or university, people may achieve a lot in their job. Second, finding a job after leaving school can be financially beneficial. This is mainly because the fee of studying at a university or a college can be very expensive, a lot of money can be saved for other purposes if one does not go to university. Also, having a job can help people to get a stable income.\n\nOn the other hand, it is my firm belief that studying at a university or college is the best route to a successful career. To begin with, students are more likely to get a good job in the future. After finishing university, a degree is provided for learners. That will help learners to get better jobs because most enterprises require a university degree. Moreover, students can have more opportunities to develop themselves if they have a university education. They can accomplish higher education such as a masterâs or Ph. D. Besides, it will be possible for them to do research in the field that they are interested in.\n\nIn conclusion, although there are some benefits of getting a job after school, I am firmly convinced that studying at university or college is much more significant.",

While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after  school, I would argue that it is better to go to college or university.  The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. Many  young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. In this way, they can  become independent, and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family.  In terms of their career, young people who decide to find work, rather than continue  their studies, may progress more quickly. They will have the chance to gain real  experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. This may lead  to promotions and a successful career.  On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their  studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. For  example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having the  relevant degree. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better job  opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer  qualifications. Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and  sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company.

    "essay": "People have different views about whether to work directly after school or to have further study at the university for finding better job opportunities. In my opinion, I believe that both studying for a better degree and having more working experience are equally important.\n\nOn the one hand, people with university or college diplomas are likely to have bright career paths. Firstly, it is easier to be employed by prestigious companies as large companies are seeking students who graduated with higher education, and some may even ask for applicants with a masterâs degree. Furthermore, those companies also believe that students with greater educational backgrounds learn things faster and provide efficient insights. Lastly, many employers are alumni of the university, it is better for networking and acquiring a job.\n\nOn the other hand, having some work experience after school is necessary. Studying from textbooks is totally different from working, and there are other skills that needed to be required. For instance, those who are going to apply for marketing jobs need to accumulate more practical experiences in order to compete with other competitors. That is because those theories learned from the textbooks are impractical, and are impossible for using in the real case. People should learn from their job, and grow from their previous experiences.\n\nTo conclude, I think that it is vital to study for higher education and also have some work experience. Both of them may lead to getting an ideal job. Consequently, it is recommended that students having an internship or a part-time job while studying may be a way to achieve both goals.",

Therefore, the conclusion and my opinion have been reached.\n\nOn the one hand, those who believe that aim for a job after school might have an idea that if we get a job as soon as possible, this will make those people have more time to work and figure out what career is best for them and they will have more experiences than those who go straight to university which is very crucial to apply for a job.

Firstly, by working, students become more mature, as they can live independently on their own income. In addition, students can learn how to manage their budgets and save money. Secondly, when students experience various workplaces, they have a chance to acquire more skills and experience.

    "essay": "Since time immemorial, commencing high-degree level of education has been imagined by numerous students globally. Why do younger need to consider in entering university immediately after their high school graduation? Some opine that by focusing their break time in getting an occupation, youngster will be beneficial. Diametrically opposed to this, I personally believe that by attending college, young age groups will have opportunity to enhance their personal potential.\n\nFirst and foremost, education experts are considered youth age 18 and above to continue their study in university level because it generates a multitude of benefits for their individual development. For example, in South-East Asia countries, most of public campuses provides a myriad of activities that supports the improvement of individuals' cognitive performance. In other words, campus attendies have a huge opportunities to develop both their soft skills and hard skills from kind of extra curricular schedules such as student body organization, business competitions, music and arts, and so forth. Moreover, this complex skills are used to prepare them in facing the real world when their study are finished.\n\nOn the other hand, several communities in the world claim that professional experiences gained from the workplaces are important for the young age groups future. This is because not many parents have sufficient funds and have ability to afford the financial consequence resulted from the yearly college fees. For instance, according to the recent data, around 20% of students in one of small island destination in South America are concerned to apply in the local firms straight after their graduation. Although they may only acquire menial job, it does not matter for them, as long as they can earn some money to contribute to their family. \n\nTo conclude then, whilst there existed contrasting stances on the matter. It is quite interesting to discuss and decide which argument is the most suitable for current global society. However, I absoultely believe, higher education level is playing indispensable role for youngster in every state worldwide, as it furnish them with self development programs during the course.",

    "essay": "It has always been an issue of debate that to get success in life whether an individual should opt for tertiary education or start work immediately after finish their school study. I, personally believe that one should have complete their education first and then move to any work field of their choice. This essay will elucidate both above-mentioned viewpoints followed by my personal perspective as well.\n\nTo commence with, higher education plays a vital role to give a specific path to any person's future. Since by acquiring university tuition a person can open doors to many different fields for himself, he can choose his choicest work for himself in which he finds comfortable. Besides this, college study broadens an individuals perspective and give wings to his or her dreams and help a person to achieve his or her future endeavours. This has been confirmed by a recent study in the USA that majority of college-goers with higher education have vast options for work. Thus, it is important to complete higher education first.\n\nOn the other hand, some people opine oppositely, they are saying that if a person starts his or her career straight after completing primary education that person can also get success and experience in their respective work. Since in this way a person does not need to spend a huge amount of money on education, they can start earning from an early age. Moreover, they do not have to tackle the burden of tertiary education as the just leave their study at a very early age. An article, for instance, published in \"the tribune\" has shown that there are so many successful personalities who left their school at an early age. Therefore, some people are favouring this in lieu of acquiring higher education.\n\nIn conclusion, this essay has discussed how individuals can attain better in their life with university education and others; however, prefer starting career ar early age. I would like to emphasize here that there is a lot of time in life to work and we will be doing it for the rest of our lives , but initially,it is imperative to complete education.",

They will have the chance to gain  real experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. This may  lead to promotions and a successful career.  On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their   studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. For   example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having the relevant degree. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer qualifications. Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. Young people who do not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to compete.  For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are more likely to be  successful in their careers if they continue their studies beyond school level.",

    "essay": "Many people believe that a prosperous career is most attributed to higher education, while some others argue that students should start a job after school. I agree that there are some benefits to working as soon as school is finished, but I  would argue that it is better to attend university or college.\nOn the one hand, entering the labor market straight after school can be beneficial for some reasons. Firstly, working can be an effective way of accumulating skills. After years of studying at school, what students need to know afterward is how they could adequately respond to things befalling them, and the key to that problem is social skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and adaptability skills, which could be acquired nowhere better than in a corporate setting. For example, when serving customers from different backgrounds at a restaurant, school students as a newcomer may have to learn the way of bringing these buyers a sense of satisfaction through observation and practical work rather than from a textbook. Secondly, people opt for landing a job straight after finishing school can make earnings that allow them to cover their basic needs, and this behavior can reduce the financial burden on their parents. In addition to that, by working from an early stage, these people can save up a considerable amount of money for their prospective objectives. Finally, school students tend to be confused about their career paths; starting to work early, therefore, may provide them with some gap time to experience and seriously consider their choice of profession.\nOn the other hand, I believe that university or college education is always the right choice for all school students. The first benefit is that higher education will furnish students with the fundamentals, which could be applied to whatever industry they will choose after graduation. Due to the insufficiency in such proper knowledge, they will be unable to sift through the sea of information and become directionless at a certain point. Moreover, it would be impossible to pursue by oneself in specific professional regions whose example can be those who want to become doctors will not achieve that goal without relevant qualifications offered by a specialized university. Another benefit is that education at a university or college can ensure more graduates' job prospects. In such an increasingly cutthroat job market, an applicant needs to make himself or herself outstanding, among others; therefore, an excellent academic background from a prestigious university and a solid grasp of knowledge can be a competitive advantage.\nIn conclusion, starting a job straight after school can have some benefits, but I believe that attending university or college is the shortest way to a successful career.",

    "essay": "It is thought that a diploma is a good condition to have a successful career, meanwhile, some people believe that it is unnecessary to enter the university or college. This essay discusses both sides of this argument and then I will give my own perspective.\n\nStudying at an educational institution after high school is a good time for student to broaden their mind and have a deeper insight into their major. In there, they are taught by many professors with years of experience. Besides, they can learn by themselves or in groups with friends in the library where there are lots of useful books to do research. To illustrate, to be a college student, it has more opportunities to practice what they learn in real life to get more experiment. For example, studying in National University of Education gives students chances to be trained to teach pupils in real school. In addition, a diploma makes personal file become more valuable and have a good impress for the employer.\n\nHowever, having a job right after graduation has its own advantages. Firstly, young people who get occupation soon will have more time to train. Clearly, they work the job they interest and do not have to waste time to learn advanced knowledge. Secondly, they can even practice in real life with many experimented people who do the same work with them. Thirdly, they are not only saving money for university, but also make money to earn a living.\n\nIn brief, I believe both points of views have their merits.

Many people believe that continuing to study at a university or college will be the best way to guarantee a successful career, whereas others believe that working right after school is a better option.\n\nWorking straight after graduation is beneficial in some ways. Firstly, by working, young people will be able to earn money as soon as possible, and since they will likely be mature enough, they will be able to live independently on their own income. It is also common knowledge that having a job leads to even more maturity.

University graduates usually get a much higher salary than those without a university education.

In my opinion, being employed before joining the university makes a person independent,however, continuing the academic qualification play a key role in getting better employment opportunity and be competitive in the market.\n\nOn the one hand, it is beneficial to start working directly after school to be independent. This is because, when a student starts their career in an early stage, they do not have to rely on others for their expenses and bills. As a result, they can have a free life with own earnings and satisfaction. For an example, according to the Australian Times published on 2019, people who have started their job, career after schooling are happier in self-supporting in comparison with highly qualified people.\n\nOn the other hand, there are significant benefits of continuing the high level of qualification. Firstly, there will be a big chance of getting better jobs. If a person has a high degree of education, there is an opportunity to be employed in top professional. For an instant, to be a Doctor, a relevant degree is required, which is impossible to get from schooling. As a result, university graduates have big hope for higher position. Secondly, there is a big competition in the market. Most of the position requires good educational background, and if young people have qualified from university or college they will be able to compete with others.\n\nIn conclusion, joining the workplace before postgraduate or undergraduate can help to be self-supporting, while continuing the study helps to get better jobs and compete with others.

This essay will discuss both views, and then I will give my own perspective.\n\nSome may argue that working after high school helps those graduates develop an independent life and gives them an insight into their future careers. First, they can learn to live independently by managing their income. In Vietnam, students who choose to work after high school are more self-reliant adults who can cover the compounding costs of accommodation, transport, and food without asking their parents for a monthly spending allowance. Second, working provides students with the opportunity and time to observe how other people work in their workplaces. As a result, they may acquire a better understanding of their chosen profession and thus make a rational decision whether to go back to university or to run a business. \n\nSupporters of studentsâ furtherance of their education have their own reasons. One benefit is that a college education is a prerequisite for employment in certain professions. For instance, it is illegal to practice medicine or give legal advice without a relevant degree in most countries in the world. Another benefit is that compared to those having only work experience, people who also have academic credentials would stand a higher chance of rising to the top and becoming leaders or managers of their companies. This is because the combined qualifications they possess can convince others that they have the necessary skills and relevant knowledge to regulate a company's operation.  \n\nIn conclusion, while there are good arguments supporting both views, it seems to me that pursuing higher education more likely leads to a rewarding career. This is because I believe that with educational qualifications, people can have good prospects of promotion and progress more quickly throughout their careers since companies tend to value educational backgrounds, whereas those without academic qualifications may face promotion problems.",

Some believe that there are more benefits to carry on their education, I agree with the statement of getting an occupation straight after their high school.\n\nTo start with, there are some factors that point out if we continue with our higher study there are more opportunities in the future. For example, if you want to be a doctor or lawyer one can not become with a certain university study.It is undeniable that students can have more knowledge and they will be received a certification which can be used for applying for a profession. Therefor, college or high school institution plays a major role.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe students should get jobs right after high institute graduation. Firstly, they will  earn extra cash as well as make them more independent. Secondly, they can gain more experiences in the real world and learn some practical life skills related to what profession they choose. To illustrate, if you were an engineer and you needed to fix a bicycle, you would have a chance to have more fixing experiences than what you learn about it at the institution. Therefore, young people who start to industry after finishing studying at institute may be promoted and become a successful person in their future career.\n\nTo summarize, higher schooling do provide with high knowledge, but some time make a wrong decision on a career choice but having a industry experience even as a starter or intern will help them to make a choice before starting their career and if they do choice to follow the same teaching as their occupation then they would succeed in their future as they would have allready reallife work experience",

Personally, I strongly disagree with this view as the future of the country depends on young people. Nevertheless, adults also have a role to play in regional development. This article will illustrate the perspectives of both sides and provide anecdotal evidence to support these arguments.\n\nOn the other hand, the progress of a country depends on how well it trains the next generation. In other words, it is necessary to invest in them as they will be the doctors, engineers, and teachers of the future. For example, recent research conducted by Zambezi University noted that the most successful countries in the world are those that invest heavily in both boys and girls.

I completely agree with the idea that it is just as important for the government to support the education of illiterate adults to be able to read and write, then the funds should be invested in this.\n\nOn the one hand why education of adults is important in  society. Firstly,the adults would directly affect a country's development, the corporation needs people to create wealth and the factory need worker to contribute to their workforce They also need knowledge to support. Secondly, a country needs funds to support development, and the finances come from  taxes. Finally, they will bring a prosperous future for the country, The technological progress, especially in the field of artificial intelligence, cannot be realized if people are not literate. Therefore, greater progress and development will only be possible if Governments prioritize the education of young adults.\n\nOn the other hand, the progress of a nation depends on how the next generation is raised. This is because adolescents, who have not yet been exposed to society and do not have to worry about making a living, have enough time and opportunities to learn professional skills. In other words, since candidates for professional jobs have to spend a long time studying and receiving proper training, investing in the education of adolescents is a must in order to produce future professionals such as doctors, nurses and scientists. In addition, a well-trained workforce will allow a variety of businesses and industries to flourish, facilitating international trade and the upcoming growth in wealth.\n\nIn conclusion, it is fundamental that there is a majority of well-educated people in society, and governments should not only focus on the education of young people  but also allocate a special budget for literate adults who cannot even read or write.

It is argued that although the younger population is educated on a priority basis, providing basic education to illiterate adults is of higher importance. Therefore, the higher governing bodies should spare some budget for this purpose. I strongly agree with the latter and believe that adults pass on their traits to their children.\n\nOn the one hand, many would disagree and feel that precedence should be given to younger people and not to grown-ups. Firstly, the youth of this day and age are deemed to be our future. Undoubtedly, if they are not educated , who will carry out all the skilled jobs that require higher institutional admissions?  For example ,doctors, engineers, architects and teachers all need to gain a certain level of knowledge and information before they can carry out their job roles. As a result, they feel it is important that they are the main point of focus.\n\nOn the other hand, others think that if adults are not educated , how will they help in teaching their offspring? For instance, children are taught at school. However, when they need help with their homework, coursework or assignments, they will need to turn to their parents for guidance. Consequently, if the parents cannot read or write, it will be the child's loss. Furthermore, studies show that those parents or guardians who have a higher level of qualification , encourage their offspring to  follow the same path ultimately, teaching them to take the route of higher education. Hence , it is critical that government allows some of its funds to be spent on uneducated groups of adults so that they can learn basic skills.\n\nTo conclude, education is a gift for those who attain it. I believe that even though the government should continue keeping younger people as the main focus of their educational fund, a small amount should also be spent on educating grown-ups to allow them to become independent.

    "essay": "In a number of countries, educating the youth is predominant. However, some people think that the elderly who are illiterate should have a higher priority in receiving an education and more resources should be allocated to governments. I totally disagree with this statement and I believe that educating the youth should be prioritized. This essay will discuss this point of view in greater detail.\n\nThe youth should be given a higher priority in education since they represent the future of a country. A majority of countries prefer to invest in youth by allocating more money and resources, therefore providing more opportunities for them to improve their skills. Since the younger generation will replace the older ones, taking over their jobs and duties, the quality of knowledge will play a vital part in developing a country. For instance, in Kazakhstan, the government provides scholarships for students who demonstrate aptitude for studying. After graduating from the universities, students are obligated to work in the country for three years, thus paying taxes and otherwise taking part in the advancement of the nation.\n\nAnother reason behind the fact that the elderly are less favoured in being provided education is their natural tendency to perceive information at a slower pace. It is a scientifically proven fact that, as people age, they can lose their ability to receive information effectively. This is the reason why providing opportunities for the elderly to educate is deemed ineffective by governments. This also explains the tendency of different companies to populate their workplaces with younger specialists.\n\nTo conclude, providing education for the younger generation must have a higher priority. This is because the youth is seen as successors of a nation since they will continue working for the benefit of their societies as well as being more able to receive information effectively. Considering all the above, governments should put more effort in educating their young.",

Therefore, a society with more uneducated adults will give room for bad governance, decline growth rate and mismanagement of resources.   \n\nIn addition, it is important for the government to provide adequate structures and funding to promote adult education reason being leaders who can neither read nor write but occupy leadership positions, will hinder the economy growth of any country. As a result, adults should be encouraged to keep learning at all cost as it promotes creative thinking and active mind. No country would experience any progressive economy growth if the policy makers, regulators or industry players are not able to make or take decisive actions. \n\nWhile educating the younger generation should not be neglected as the saying goes âthey are the leaders of tomorrowâ however, their tomorrow can only be guaranteed where the leaders steering the wheels are constantly learning to be able to preserve the resources of the country for the younger generation.  \n\nIn conclusion, it is important that any government who understands that educating adults is key to growth, would provide adequate funding in setting up structures that would supports adult education.",

    "prompt": "Education for young people is important in many\n countries. However, some people think that the government should spend more money on education in adult populations who cannot read and write. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
    "essay": "Formal schooling for the young is of immense significance for a countryâs socio-economic development,\n\n however, some people are convinced that more money should be allocated for educating illiterate adults. I agree with this view to some extent and will analyse the issue in the following essay.\n\nOn the one hand, government budgets in many countries, particularly in under-developed and developing\n\n nations, are limited. Therefore, if more funding is spent on improving adult literacy rates, the education of children and adolescents may suffer as a consequence of less funding. Eventually, maintaining a suitable level and quality of education, for both children and illiterate adults, may become an impossible task with limited funding, possibly negatively affecting the education of both groups. \n\nHowever, due to a decrease in the number of blue-collar jobs, thanks to automatic processes, a large number of illiterate adults who work in such positions are being made redundant, and therefore increasing the unemployment rate due to their lack of literacy skills when searching for other types of work. This situation not only reduces the standard of living for many people, but is also an underlying motive for a rise in social problems, such as crime, homelessness, and poverty. Providing formal schooling to adults who cannot read or write proves to be a useful measure to reduce the negative consequences that may occur in a society with high levels of adult illiteracy.\n\nIn conclusion, state funding may not allow an adequate amount of money for the education of both the youth\n\n and adults to take effect. However, I still believe that if more money is spent on educating illiterate adults, social welfare in such regions will benefit tremendously.",

    "essay": "These days, the communities urge to have an instant result to things, such as services, information, and tasks. I think that there is one factor to this condition. Furthermore, I have a strong agreement that this situation is a positive development for us.\n\nThe reason for this instant habit is the development of the information technology and service businesses that made everything provided in less than a minute. We can get any information in a second by scrolling our phones, like the updates of the USA presidency. Moreover, there is an excessive number of services so that we do not have to be bothered by doing a complex task. For example, the Writing9.com website helps us in doing IELTS writing exam practices by scoring our essay with artificial intelligence. \n\nI suggest that this is a positive phenomenon because it increases our work efficiency. The fast rate of information will push our works to be done quickly. For instance, a project manager is able to create a project charter in a short time because the person can download a template from the internet. Additionally, we are able to finish big activities by collaborating with external parties. To illustrate, in developing our company's staff, the human resource department can hire professional coaches to put awareness about working diligently in the staffs' minds.\n\nSecond, it may develop the country's economic condition as it opens more opportunities to service transactions. The engagement of people happens. Consequently, more individuals or groups need external services. In the case of home service, if someone that owns an apartment is lazy to clean the room, he/she may order a cleaning service. Thus, this can help more humans to have a job.\n\nIn short, the instant state of mind happens because of the development of our technologies. Even though some individuals may see this case with a negative mindset, I have to agree that this situation is good for us.",

    "essay": "In recent years, the amount of food that is thrown away uneaten has increased, achieving a great deal of media attention. Given that food waste has far-reaching effects, both nationally and globally, identifying the reasons behind it is key to finding the solutions.\n\nThere is a number of reasons why a large amount of food are wasted around the world. First, since most of the food is meat and vegetables, which are perishable, there are always best-before dates or expiries labelling on them. This means that if people don't consume them quickly enough, foods will be no longer edible and they will have to discard them as a result. Second, the way humans prepare or produce food also contributes to food waste. For instance, if a dish in a restaurant or at home is not delicious because of bad cooking or preparation, people will be more likely to throw them away.\n\nNevertheless, there are many actionable solutions to address this issue. Even if food scraps are inedible for humans, they can still be donated to farmers who can use them for livestock or animal feed. This would not only benefit the agriculture industry but also mitigate the environmental burden. In addition, food waste can also be used to compost or produce renewable energy. For example, technological advancements today allow humans to turn oil and fat into biodiesel fuel that is not only lower cost but also environmentally friendly.\n\nIn conclusion, although food waste can cause a whole host of other problems, each individual can take steps to solve this issue if they are aware that they all have the power to do it.",

    "essay": "The importance of a job has always been debatable and has now become more controversial with a few people claiming that the social skills of a job applicant are more important than their academic achievements for a particular job position. In my opinion, I completely disagree with the given view.\n\nAnalysing the view and explaining further, I believe academic qualifications are important to enter a cooperative world. This is because there are specific criteria set by an organisation or a company for a particular job post. For instance, if you do not meet that criteria you are unable to work in that company. Academic qualifications show your skills to do a particular work. For example, if you have done a certain project during your graduation and achieved good grades by an examiner, this will showcase your skills to job givers.\n\nMoreover, job selection has changed these days. There are three to four stages which job applicants have to pass in order to get selected. When a person applies for a particular job, the first and foremost thing that he/she has to provide is a resume. Though a resume includes your social skills but academic qualifications are the main reason why the resumes are short-listed. Moreover, there are jobs which just require your academic skills as compared to your social skills. For example, it is not important for government hackers to possess any social skills.\n\nTo conclude, according to the aforementioned points I believe that academic qualifications are an important aspect for job seekers apart from social skills.",

I partially agree with the statement and I would like to elaborate on it in detail below.\n\nThe merits of outstanding social skills are apparent.  Firstly, communication is the key factor that helps to interact with different people on the whole and assists in creating a good buyer-seller relationship.  It can promote the growth of the business too.  Secondly, by having good communication skills anyone can excel in their respective fields either it may be sales or any other departments for the matter of fact.  For example, an employee with excellent presentation expertise can help customers understand the products and can convey them to buy that product.  Furthermore, employees with better interaction skills are generally easygoing, which is crucial for the workplace and the employer too.\n\nIn contrast, some people believe that academics are the pre-requisites of  employment.  Apparently, there are many positions that require high knowledge and capability of dealing with them smoothly.  For example, an administrative role in a company requires the applicant to have high qualifications to take prompt managerial decisions.  Such qualities are developed when a person has studied the subjects thoroughly.  Not only having social skills but also acquiring higher studies is equally important to run any organization smoothly.\n\nIn conclusion, I think both advanced studies and other communicational skills are of equal importance in todayâs world.  Having workers with both these qualities make an organization grow and prosper thereby helping in building a strong workforce altogether.",

    "essay": "In the hectic world, everyone is seen ignoring taking care of their loved ones. In many cultures, youth are lawfully abiding to fulfil their duty towards the elder generations. I strongly agree with the statement that the younger generation should have a moral obligation towards older generations. In the following ,paragraphs I would like to elaborate on similar reasons with examples. \n\nTo begin with, the growing age causes wear and tear on the body parts due to which it is not possible for them to take care of themselves. For instance, my grandfather cannot walk due to knee operations and is advised to use a wheelchair, and my father always assists him. Therefore, it is mandatory for offspring to stay beside them and help them whenever necessary. Additionally, teenagers should talk to grandparents to keep their mood cheerful to avoid having negative thoughts such as overthinking. \n\nFurthermore, it is difficult for older people to take care of their finances all alone, especially when they are not earning a stable regular income. For example, my grandmother had a recent eye operation which was out of her budget to pay the expenses, even after using all the fixed deposit amount the remaining amount was a large amount to be paid. Thus, the younger generation can help the older generation by providing a health insurance card which covers all the treatments and the expenses at  budget-friendly rates. \n\nTo encapsulate, when we are younger our parents always took care of us because we were unable to complete things on our own, similarly as they grow older, it is difficult for them to take care of themselves and hence a help from youngsters could be peaceful, satisfied and create a blissful journey for them.",

    "essay": "In recent years, taking a responsibility to help elders has been of much interest to the general public. Some deem that it is reasonable to take care of old ages legally. Nevertheless, other people assert that it is never a duty for young generations.\n\nTo begin with, it is evident that elderly people donât have sufficient strength to labour outside. As getting older, their health condition will get worse mentally and physically. According to an sociologist in USA, he pointed out that it will be more and more difficult for the elder to earn a living when their ages are over 65. It can be said that more than 65 years aged elderly will encounter substantial issues concerning survival such as foods, shelters and apparels. There is no doubt that the government should prioritize to support older families for their stable aged years.\n\nOn top of that, people should not dismiss older familiesâ economic matters. Due to their lacked capability to work, their budgets will be shrunk on a day-to-day basis even though their ages are rising and their medical fees are more needed. Moreover, they also already consumed most of finances to support their springs in their young ages. Letâs take an 80 years old man who has no money to cure himself because he spent all of his money to raise his kids. In this situation, there is no method for him to flee from this situation. Therefore, there is no doubt that the young should return their rewards to return their contributions for nations and families. \n\nIn conclusion, it goes without saying that the youngsters should take their duties for the olderâs better welfare. This is because they are lack of physical and mental ability to work and loss of financial assistance. Given that this trend will become more prevalent in the future, the young generations should find ways to minimize its influences from this issue.",

For example, Building of a geriatric home for the aged will relieve the burden from young family members.\n\nDespite the fact that it is the responsibility of the young people to care for the aged those in support of this argue that,the elderly have invested in the younger people ,so showing love and support is what they need from the younger ones.This point is not sustainable because there are elderly ones who do not care or invested in their children and expect them to do so as they are physically psychologically and financially unable .\n\nIn conclusion,the aged should have an insurance policy and the governments should support them it should not be the legal responsibility of the younger ones to support them in their old age",

    "essay": "Deterioration is observed in almost every human body after reaching a certain age and therefore it is believed by some people that young members should be made obliged legally to take care of their elders when they face problems in physical, mental and financial terms. I agree with this statement to a large extent reasons for which will be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs. \n\nFirst reason for my agreement is that laws would make young people to make plans that involve securing not only their own future but also of their parents. Usually, people take their needs into consideration while planning future. Not many consider the fact that along with them their parents are getting older too who would after some time require some support finance and emotions wise. Existence of a rule which mandates youth to take care of the elderly would help in safeguarding the future of those who have contributed in the growth and development of their respective nations when they were still young. \n\nAnother reason why I concur with this view is that old people suffer from mental and physical ailments mostly because they have stress about their future. Since their body and brain are not in their optimum status they can't help but feel helpless and weak. Because of this reason majority of the people suffer from diseases such as heart disease, brain tumor,  blood pressure and many more. If there is a law,  for instance, that asures them their future, these problems would, in my opinion, reduce by half.   \n\nThough there is a possibility that majority of old people's future would be secured because of the law requiring young people to look after the elders, there has to be some other law too which asks young people to save for themselves to save their future. Because future is unpredictable, one may or may not have someone to take care in the future. Hence, I have one more suggestion regarding the laws to give, which is that young people must have a legal obligation of saving money for themselves to protect their future even if there is no young member in their life to support them.  \n\nIn conclusion, having a lawsuit that requires young people to protect the future of their elder family members could help in giving them much needed security in their last years of life, however, there should also be a legal necessity for young peoe to save some money for the life later.",

    "essay": "The vast majority of the population deems that junior members of the house should legitimately take care of the senior households as they become not capable of doing so. I strongly advocate with the opinion of the majority and am going to reflect my own view of such a common issue.\n\nFirst of all, since humans are the only intelligent being on the face of the earth we have to help people who are in need. Humanity is gifted with empathy, compassion and kindness in comparison with animals. For example, every other creature leaves their family after getting mature enough to live by itself. Therefore, sharing love between one another is the right way in the eyes of the morality in hardship and also kind of pay-back to our elderly members for looking after us when we were kids.\n\nOn the other hand, it can be spotted that the government indeed must give a hand in this particular situation. In other words, after all the paid taxes and contribution put into country growth cannot be forgotten in my opinion. In fact, many individuals live not just for themselves  but for the sake of family as well, in addition to that most of them have sacrificed their precious lives for country development like scientists, doctors, teachers and etc. I think authorities take action on this problem by stable pension to older members of society and building nursing houses in order to look after people who are unstable mentally or physically. \n\n  To conclude, although looking after someone may be a burden sometimes, generally it is our moral duty to do and legalization of that is something we have to accomplish.",

With the acceleration of people's living tempo, young people are quite busy that can not spare enough time for their old parents. Furthermore, they face heavy pressure from their society, work and families. In addition to this, they have to shoulder the responsibility in the face of caring and providing a happy life for old people. However, it is a burden for them that they cannot sit the whole day talking with their parents. They have to concentrate more on their work. Because, the more they devote themselves to work, the better life they can provide for old parents. Secondly, special old-man clubs can offer entertainment facilities and bounteous food. The old people can there make some new companies and friends establishing good relationships with them.\n\n    On the other hand, young people should pay more attention to old parents providing a happy life. Despite the benefits of old man clubs, young people themselves should take off their old parents. There older people may  feel lonely that miss their daughters, sons and grandchildren and also, want to celebrate the special holiday events together with all family members at home. They prefer a family atmosphere.\n\n     To sum up, I think younger family members should provide a good living environment by caring for them.",

    "essay": "It has been highly debatable topic these days that Whether the government should allot the funds for the recreation field, or focus on the health wellbeing  and education for the public. I completely agree with this statement due to certain and specific reasons. \n\nThere are plethora of reasons that can explain well that the authorities need to consider spending money on education and health. The primary factor that could be taken into account is that arts plays indispensable role in the developing the positive environment. This is because artists are using the recycle materials to create a useful art. To illustrate, In India, empty walls on the roads are painted with colours and gives amazing feature when walking. In addition to this, it supports thÃ© efforts of you g children who are performing good in arts field and lack knowledge in other ares of study. \n\nWhile, I also believe thÃ¡t health and education sectors should have equal access to the money provided by the government. This is due to the cause tháº¯t education considered as áº£ significant tool that can ensure bright future of any nation. People who are below poverty are not able to study due to financial instability, hence free educational services must be introduced to these minor families. The eminent example of free education can be seen in UK where the government is taking the whole responsibility of their educational until the age of 18 in case of financial crisis. Apart from this, health sector must introduce the free health services to promote thÃ¨ health and wellness, since all of the individuals are paying huge amount of taxes while they were working.  Therefore,  it is necessary that government needs to help them in later age when they are unable to pay for their health conditions. \n\nIn conclusion, I accept that government needs to give some money to arts field, while  I believe that Health and educational departments require same amount of money, and should never be neglected.",

But, some people claim that most of the government authorities exploit a lot of money on the arts and some local inhabitants support them. But other people argue that authorities must donate that money to the education and health sectors. I will elaborate my ideas with suitable examples regarding the given notion. \n\nTo strengthen my point of view, art could boost the economic conditions of the country. First and foremost, if the government will spend plentiful money on  art then it can increase the economy of the nations because a lot of people will visit those countries to see the artwork with their naked eyes as some people are very addicted to looking at the craft so they can relax their mind as well as  they can gather heaps knowledge in their life about the different cultures. For instance, in India, they have  multiple art museums also, they made various kinds of art on the walls that belong to the history of India and they also draw some popular persons dint of this, masses could obtain enough information about their culture and, around one thousand of people come to see those art work from another corner of the world and India is getting around forty per cent of the profit from the artwork. \n\nOn the other hand, it is the top  priority of the government to offer excellent medical and educational facilities to the public. Firstly, if the administration will allocate funds for  medical amenities then it could improve the health of the public as people can get  good treatment for their diseases as a result, they could stay healthy and they can live long for a long time. Apart from that, educational institutions could be improved by providing  superior teachers and government can give grants to build more schools and colleges so that, people can fetch a great education and then  can work   good jobs owing to this, the masses can live sedentary lifestyle as well as, they will pay the tax to the government and it could assist to increase the economy consequently, authorities can use that taxes on other facilities. \n\nTo recapitulate, executives must use funds on medical and education facilities so that people can get  good jobs and better health as well as, art could not be ignored as it also put influence   some folks and they can start their businesses to earn  capital.",

Because such investment for individuals who are professional in these skills will give them an opportunity to flourish their work; and they will earn name and fame for the country in exhibitions at national as well as international levels. Moreover, such financial support from government will encourage the youth to fulfil their dreams in this sector. A survey conducted by the National Statistics of India reveals that one million dollars had spent by the government of India to build the art schools.\n\nOn the other side, some folks believe that governments should give priority to finance hospitals and educational institutes. As there is an exorbitant rise in the number of patients and health ailments nowadays, hospitals should be built to compensate them. Apart from this, education is an indispensable part of society that should be focused by the law enforcement agencies. By doing so, numerous children as well as adults who are not financially stable will get admission in the government funded institutes. To illustrate the above notions, in this pandemic of Covid-19 there is a huge requirement of hospitals and well educated people to encounter this scourge.\n\nIn conclusion, although spending money by administrations on art and skills give a platform to youth to develop their work, creativity, well-being and superior education are the need of the hour. Hence, I opine that governments should priorities the health and education sector for investing money as compared to the arts.",

    "essay": "Nowadays despite all the various types of clues we have about our healthy lifestyle, most of them are not successful to capture people's attention ,plus extra warnings  released by pundits have not been noticed by people and people still continue their previous methods of living and nourishments. In my opinion, people's life contains many big and small issues which will not let them  think the detrimental movements and just want to do their routine work. Eliminating all problems will help communities to follow all recommendations and a healthy way of life.\n\nOn the one hand, making structure for people's safety is one criterion but the most important one is to encourage them to follow the notices and adapt them to their life. With this regard, authorities should organize some macro-political for health activities and set some advantages for one who uses these structures. For instance, providing free bicycles to reduce the amount of usage of private means of transport or make some noticeable discount for using one who uses public transportation. Considering that, the huge support will be happened by the government and folks will not be worried about the expense of the utilization of the new structure. \n\nOn the other hand , some health movement does not need a special device, it is just about your lifestyle and should be complied but the community still do not care about the noxious relocating. In these cases, the educational system could be played an active role and make people  obey the rules or even recommendations which are just suited for their liv. For illustration, making  a special compulsory lesson for pupils to teach them the real way of life to keep them safety. \n\nto sum up, there are many healthy lifestyles in which special frameworks will be given to residents by experts to amend their way of life and cause well-being. In spite of that people still follow their own rules for  safe, the best dissolution to affect all these programs is that special problems in their life must be resolved and  intensive schemes should be set up by authorities.",

Secondly, unhealthy eating is another major concern of the masses. For instance people prefer fast food to make up for the loss of time and eat while they are on the go. \n\nIn my opinion, people donot understand the underlying effects of unhealthy living since they live in the moment and donot understand its disadvantages in the long run.

    "essay": "It is a fact that a large proportion of the population continues to engage in unhealthy activities, irrespective of expert advice, which is being increasingly witnessed. This essay will discuss the main cause of this phenomenon and also suggest methods to solve this problem.\n\nExamining the reasons, the most common is that people are prone to underestimate the cumulative adverse effects of an unhealthy lifestyle as it doesn't occur immediately. In addition, many unhealthy activities are addictive and people can't leave them easily, for example, smoking is a slow killer and it is mentioned everywhere but people continue to smoke .\n\nThe solutions are not simple but they do exist. Firstly, Government should increase taxes on unhealthy products ,especially on cigarettes so it should be hard for everyone to buy and consume them. Secondly, media channels should promote healthy lifestyles and criticise unhealthy activities. Furthermore, higher authorities can conduct  different sports events which can encourage people to participate and keep themselves healthy and fit for these events.\n\nTo conclude the topic, it can be finally commented that by self-motivation and with the help of the Government we can reduce the proportion of people who are addicted to unhealthy activities.",

    "essay": "Everyone's goal  to be fit with a healthy mind and body, and today's society is being more conscious about leading a healthy lifestyle. Despite whatever scientist's advice, about what is good and bad for our body, still people continue to do unhealthy activities. In my opinion, the main cause for this is being addicted to substance abuse, and the apt solution is education and therapy, which will be further discussed in this essay.\nTo begin with, activities such as smoking and drinking are sill continued by a large proportion of people, despite being aware of its ill effects. In cigarettes the substance nicotine causes addiction, while in alcohol, it is due to dependance. Easy availability and peer pressure are the main reasons for this dependance. Moreover, another ill habit to be noted is that of chewing tobacco, leading to dental and oral cancers. People have been following this activity generations back and is still considered as part of a culture in some regions. For instance, in Bihar it is a custom that guests should chew pan, as a sign of gesture of accepting their hospitality.\nHowever, various  steps can be taken to take care of these issues. One of which is, to rehabilitate  people who are addicted to drinking, by being admitted at de-addiction centres. In these centres, the patient would undergo a series of counselling and medical therapies. Whereas, in the case of nicotine, other than educating its side effects other measures are to be implemented. In which, nicotine in cigarettes needs to be replaced with nicotine gums or patches, where eventually their dependance can be reduced with time.\nIn conclusion, even though people are aware of the drawbacks of an unhealthy lifestyle they continue with it due to its dependance. But, these habits can be curbed to an extent by counselling and rehabilitation.",

However, some people feel that the main benefits are in the world business. It surely is debatable and both views seems to hold water. But before coming to a reasonal conclusion, let us discuss both views.\n\nOn the one hand, there could be a myriad of reasons why some people say that foreign aid works with the help of other countries to save the things that is very important to survive. Moreover, A good example to explain this is our Prime Minister invited thirty four countrie's head into the G20 program in New Delhi last year,  to discuss on the many important documentaries. According to an artical published in The Tribune, a leading national newspaper in India, studies have shown that every foreign was very excited and want to see all unity to work for the environment.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might feel that these types of meeting is only for business benefits. It is probably believe so because department works very slow and it takes too much time to implement. As well as, population can not believe on fake commitments.\n\nIn conclusion, since both viewpoints hold water, it is difficult to favour one argument. But I do feel that every government takes best decission to protect their public from environmental situations, and that should be very important to do.",

Firstly, the advantages of cooperative institutions are providing protection to the environment by giving advertisements related to pollution-free nature by producing and marketing vehicles and other products which are less pollution-free. For instance, some vehicles run by electricity and less air pollution are achieved. In addition , they initiated to sustain nature by preventing deforestation are considerably successful in later years.                                    However, electric vehicles cannot be afforded by commoners mainly those who have whitecollar jobs.

    "essay": "Every parent thinks the best for their children. But sometimes they unintentionally overlook\n\ntheir  youngsterâs interest, so in my opinion parents should consider children's opinion and give them the freedom to follow their passion. However, If a child is more into studying and doing, a less physical activity then in that case parents should motivate their child for physical activity.\n\nFirst of all, I believe that good parenting is a crucial part of any childâs life. It should be done wisely and in a proper manner then it is beneficial for both. For example, if a child is spending more time  studying then parents should come up with different ideas so that the child will develop an interest in physical activity. Such as, they can enrol their child in a swimming class or football club. This kind of activity will definitely help that child to grow their liking in outdoor pastimes.\n\nSecondly, only performing fun and games is not acceptable. Some students focus only on games and the majority of the time they invest in sport as a result this highly impacts student academics. In this ,case parents need to explain to their kids the importance and the value of the study. Moreover, study educates children in every possible way which helps them to be  wise people.

Therefore, parents should try to balance the amount of time children spend for both these types of activities. \nOn the one hand, it is important for a children to be well-educated. Spend time studying can help children to train their ability in logical thinking and hard-working. These skills not only shown it value to increase the productivity of the students at school, but also very benefitial for their life after graduation. It can be argued that these skills provide more jobs opportunities, career progression, better salaries, and therefore improve the quality of life for students who have them. Moreover, it is also crucial to ensure our next human generation have enough knowledge to continue the humanityâs development. They are the future world leaders, so giving them a better education can result in the latter new inventions, economic growth or greater future prosperity.\nOn the other hand, physical workouts also play an important role in the life of a child. Doing regular body exercises is believe to be benefitial for the childrenâs health, especially for the immune system, thus help to reduce the risk of children suffer from many kind of diseases such as obesity or near-sighted. Physical activities also force youngsters make contact with the nearby society, make them more socialize and out-going.

    "essay": "In contemporary world, globalization is a worldwide tendency. Although   some individualsâ reliance on the merits of this, others are skeptical about it. I will examine both sides before the final conclusion is drawn.  On the one hand, integration can fuel the development of economy. This is   because when the countries all around the world maintain the interaction, the potentials of each country can be identified and made use of. For example, as Viet Nam and the USA keep a friendly relationship, the  investment between two countries can be stable, leading to the economic   prosperity of both countries. Moreover, globalization may open up avenues for cultural exchange. As a result, dwellers from different countries can widen their understanding about other countriesâ values, consequently, it  will fortify the unity between different nations. Hence, it is obvious that   integration poses numerous benefits.  On the other hand, the business and cultural contact can also make the   country run the risk of losing national traditions. This is to say, currently, youngsters in many Eastern countries are biased towards the Western culture but forgetting the values of national heritages, or even criticize the traditions of their nations, resulting the deterioration of patriotism. Furthermore, integration is likely to cause horrendous problems for some developing countries if they depend excessively on developed countriesâ investment. Consequently, some developing countries will lose their financial independence, as a result, the will be instability of worldâs economic state. Thus, the globalization can not be seen as entirely positive.  To conclude, despite the fact that integration and interaction between   countries still holds some demerits, I totally subscribe to the notion that the upsides of this tendency always surpass the downsides.",

Many people believe that this rise of financial and cultural engagement among nations is improving economies while others tend to assume that a lot of countries will forget their cultural integrity. In my opinion, business and cultural exchanges will provide more benefits and only those countries, whose cultural identity is not deeply rooted in their populace have chances of losing their identity. Let's discuss both views and try to come to a conclusion.\n\nFrequent interactions amongst continents for products and services which are abundant in one and scarce in another, is leading to monetary benefits which result in boosting the economy of the seller. For instance, the middle east was able to acquire a huge amount of wealth by exporting oil and gas which was available in large quantities in their continent.\n\nHowever, countries which do not have a strong and developed ideology and value system might lean towards picking up ideas and thought process from other regions. They also run a risk of losing out on their cultural identification in the process. For example, places like the Philippines majorly have a thought process like a western country like America and might not be able to boast of their own idealogy.\n\nIn conclusion, though we had people believing both the positive and negative effects of global financial agreements and their effect on local heritage, we have reasons to believe that the benefits outweigh the detrimental effect.",

    "essay": "Some people claim that the best option to avoid complexity in their life is to live without technology. I completely disagree with this statement because of its important roles in terms of supportive education and professional work.\n\nThe first reason I believe that technology supports learnersâ study journey. It is more convenient for students who prefer studying with teachers through Internet rather than at school. Advanced platforms, these help learners with their study activities that are the same as on campus. Whatever they need, they can use it for many purposes. For instance, during the Covid-19 pandemic, online learning was popular in many countries where all educated institutions were closed. Therefore, it is clear that the technology has useful benefits even in  bad conditions. \n\nThe second reason is that it improves connection at the workplace. Those who always have to work with people can keep in touch with them without losing connection. Particularly, working people who specialize in customer service departments. They can keep in touch and respond to all requirements of their clients at any time and place. For instance, designers use mobile applications like Telegram to create a group for discussing and reviewing projects for the clients. Thus, this trend might improve and maintain the customerâs needs. \n\nIn conclusion, people think that their life may have more complicated regard with technology.

From my point of view, I strongly disagree with the opinion that we should live without technology due to fact that it has been exceptionally beneficial for humanity for many reasons. \n\n   \n\nTo begin with, there has been improvements in many aspects of life with the rapid growth of innovations.

Digital telecommunication allows us to connect with others without barriers in an easier, faster and more effective way. To exemplify, the emergence of the internet leads to  greater access to information and online communication. At the same time, many people assert that easy access to the digital realm can negatively impact a relationship by being a distraction that distant people in real life.

    "essay": "In recent times, it is paramount to recycle plastic bags, bottles etc. To reduce the wastage of natural and man-made resources and to improve its usefulness. Many people argue that children should learn this skill of recycling objects at school, while others insist that parents should teach this to their children.  I admit that parents can act as a guide or mentor, but I firmly believe that in academy students can get practical knowledge also. This essay will discuss both the views by demonstrating facts and points.\n\nTo begin with, it is very important to protect the environment from getting polluted. For this, schools can introduce a compulsory subject of waste management in the curriculum. Therefore, children will learn more about it as dedicated time slot will be allocated for exploring this issue. Moreover, children will get hands-on experience and practical knowledge too. It is evident that cognition and intellectual skills are developed more by performing group activities. Peers play a vital role in encouraging and inculcating interest in things which aloof individual finds hard to incur. So, school can act as a channel to motivate its students in reducing the misuse.\n\nOn the other hand, kids at home imitate what their parents do. For example, the way parents eat, communicate, etc. Similarly, parents should imbibe the habits of reducing and reusing left over items in themselves, which will be ultimately inherited to the next generation. It has been always stated that home is the first school of the kids. Therefore, parents should indulge their kids in such activities and help then in becoming responsible citizens of the nation. \n\n To conclude, parents are the primary source of the knowledge of the kids and what parents can do nobody can do.

    "essay": "It is argued that the lack of accommodations in metropolitans can result in serious impacts and in order to tackle those problems, government action is the only choice. In my opinion, I totally agree with the statement for the following reasons. \n\nTo start with, many people suppose that individuals can offer aid by creating and setting up their own houses which are fully attached with amenities. However, I believe this is a short-sighted view. To make this clear, a person can afford the money to purchase or even construct a shelter to live in but they can not guarantee the quality of the materials for the structures. For instance, in 2019, a family consisting of 5 members in a small village of Hokkaido - Japan managed to create a house made of bricks and woods on their own. Even though it was well-designed with plenty of decorations and furniture, eventually the house collapsed and took away the lives of the whole family. Due to their deaths, the police found out that the system of their house was not strong enough to handle and resulting in a tragedy. Thus, there is a high risky chance to deal with this problem alone.\n\nOn the other hand, I strongly believe that the solutions to this issue could be undertaken by the government. The authorities always prior the safety of citizens first so they often provide the basic facilities for them. To address this, many high-rise blocks, skyscrapers,...etc which solve peopleâs housing have been completed. One of the best examples of this would be in the USA, the government has witnessed the booming population and responded to the inhabitants by devising plans to make buildings that could house people. Additionally, those buildings can ease the traffic for the commuters and facilitate the communityâs lives but also the most important thing is that still remains the quality of the structures. Besides, by resolving all the housing issues, more and more people will definitely move in from the urban areas to seek opportunities. Therefore, it is likely to be beneficial for the dwellers through the action of the government. \n\nIn conclusion, after the aforementioned reasons, it is no doubt that the government can ensure the quality of peopleâs housing and surely can enhance it.",

While I agree to this sentiment in general, it is important to understand the limits of state intervention on this issue. I will discuss my reasons in this essay.\n\nTo begin with, there are several factors behind housing problems in many countries. Foremost, the increase in population in some cities have a direct impact on this situation. Consequently, the limited resources available in cities such as land, water and food availability does not matched with the increase in demand. Therefore, it is the duty of the state to find solutions to this, in order to minimize social consequences. A good example, is health officials can take steps to encourage couples to have family plans that do not become a burden to the city, they live in. On the other hand, the government can implement efficient housing schemes in their countries with the help of international agencies.\n\nHowever, there are other parties that can solve these issues effectively. For instance, media professionals have a bigger role to play in this kind of a situation. Actually, they can assist public health officials to educate people on family planning by promoting several programmes in this regard. Moreover, certain charity and non government agencies can provide additional funds to authorities to build appropriate housing complexes in populated cities. In addition, academic professionals can help the state to planning of such housing projects in more environmental friendly way.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that limitations of government agencies can be easily overcome by third parties such as media and academic communities to overcome housing shortages in a country.

    "essay": "In metropolitan cities, the shortage of accommodation is turning into a severe burden for citizens and some are of the opinion that this issue can be tackled solely by the actions of a government. I completely agree with this argument and I will fortify my view in the following paragraphs.Â \n\nOne reason why I believe the government can deal with this problem is that it holds the right to imply new rules and policies and there are some sounding rules which would be logical to introduce. For example, if they apply a rule regarding the encouragement of the construction of high-rise buildings and prohibition of the old landed houses, more people can dwell in flats and this results in a considerable amount of land saving. In contrast, if the authority would not take such a precaution, there wouldn't be enough space for the forthcoming citizens.Â \n\nAnother outstanding solution would be enticing people, who live in the rural areas, away from migrating to big cities. In order to maintain this, power owners should convince or force factories and companies in relocating their businesses to these outskirts. By doing that, new job opportunities can be created for those who are desperately looking for ways to migrate with the hope of finding a job. As a result, local people might convince away from moving. For instance, in Istanbul, many big financial companies moved their headquarters to different cities and this significantly reduced the rate of migration to Istanbul.\n\nIn conclusion, the shortage in housing evidently creates a crisis among the citizens of big cities, and I think, the role of government is essential due to their right to change laws in the ways of solving this crisis.",

    "essay": "Metropolitan cities face a severe shortage of accommodation Â leading to declining health and rising crimes.,Apparently the issue can be tackled Â only by a government intervention either by putting a limit on on the entry of new people into cities or by expanding the urban region.The public contribution is limited in solving the issue as  the root cause of the shortage of land remains unresolved. \n\nÂ \n\nSince the basic issue lies in the lack of space for building houses,the community has a limited role in executing a long-term solution.Temporarily,they may resolve shortage by sharing homes or residing in the countryside and travelling daily for jobs.The former solution can result in poor Â health due to overcrowding and lack of adequate basic facilities while the latter would cause mental stress to those commuting long distances daily.Both these would affect the productivity of these people in their jobs.\n\nThe government can make a marked change in this situation by restricting the entry for new residents as that can give more time to solve the current housing issues.Then the administration should ensure that the population is proportionate to the land available and take measures to sustainably build adequate housing apartments.An alternative solution wud be by subsuming nearby farmland or expanding the outskirts of cities so as to provide the required amount of land for building suburbs.\n\nÂ \n\nIn conclusion,I believe that the housing shortage in metropolia can be effectively solved by the government either by having a practical ratio of citizens with land or by expanding the land to build new residences.City folks have a limited role as they can only adapt to the available accommodation though it is with great difficulty.",

    "essay": "There is no denying that the worldâs population is rapidly increasing. As a result, megacities need some modifications in order to accommodate such changes. It is agreed that governments are responsible for applying and constructing huge developmental movements. While people could be of help with the insufficient housing situation, the need for funding and the complexity of the issue, make the government the sole saviour from such a disaster.\n\nIt is clear that sums of money are needed in order to multiply the available housing, Which is almost impossible to provide without the help of governments. For instance, Egypt used to suffer from a lack of convenient accommodations. Hence, the government started the social housing program that provided many flats and apartments to the public. The construction of the program costs fortunes. If the government were not involved it could never be done. \n\nLooking at the consequences of the discussed topic, it is evident that it has tragic effects on  society as a whole, not just the underprivileged. Furthermore, homeless people negatively impact the economy as well as the social aspect of society. To illustrate, a country with numerous homeless people in its big city would hardly ever attract foreign investments. That being said, those who rule should take all measures to avoid the terrible disasters that result from the limited availability of housing.\n\nTo conclude, the number of major city inhabitants is accelerating, which in turn urges the government to create solutions. While most possible methods to deal with the overpopulation require financial support, additionally if not solved will affect both the society and the economy, and the government is the only one to blame.",

As compared with glass and containers which is the highest recycled product beginning at 50%,  1988 saw a slight dip, it subsequently rose to 70% in 2010. \n\nOn the other hand, the two least recycled materials saw an increase over the period.

This can pose some serious social effects. It is of popular opinion that only the government can provide solutions to this issue and I completely agree with the statement. \n\nSome people may claim that the population can control the housing shortage. They may refer to these situations like that which will warrant individuals, to sought jobs with better-earning capacity. As a  result, they can afford the high housing fees and they can live more comfortably, and they can avoid  being victims of social circumstances.\n\nI believe this argument does not stand up to scrutiny, as it is only logical that only the government can create means to improve housing condition. To begin, the state can facilitate dÃ©congestion of the urban centres by prioritizing the rural area development. As a result, the rate at which people immigrate to the big cities will be slowed down, also there can be emigration from big cities to the small towns. For example, the Tribune Newsline, a well-known news website reported the population decline in Kumasi, a well-developed city in Ghana that occurred in the year 2010- 2015. As a result of industries and construction of better roads in smaller cities. Furthermore, the government can affect laws against real estate agencies from charging the inhabitants exorbitantly. In effect, it  can limit some negative situations as sexual abuse, and increased crime rate in the society.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that although some  others may disagree with the notion, I opine that only the state has the capacity to tackle the sheltering issue through the betterment of rural areas and put a stop to overpricing of houses by real-estate dealers.

Althought some people claim that only goverments can deal with this issue, in my opinion with a combination both of the goverment and individual, this problem can be tackled  as I will discuss in the following essay. \n\nThere is no doubt that goverments have power to establish legislation and subsidies. For example, goverments will fine real estate agencies if they overcharge in the amount of price to live in the city, Therefore, real estate agencies would provide a reasonable price to sale. Furthermore, another thing goverments can do is to provide financial supportted who buy housing in the city . A good example of this is Taiwan goverment share a proportion of money to subsidies people who buying a husing in the urban area. As a result, citizens can alleviate the financial burden. \n\nOn the other hand, individual also need to take actions in order to deal with this issue. People should try  find vertical apartments instead of  private twonhouses in urban area. For example,  In Sigarpore, the marjoority people tend to live in high-rise building so that more people can live in the city. By doing this,  apartments can accommodate more population in the urban area. \n\nIn Conculsion, despite the fact that government should take most responsibility, from my perspective, a combination of government and individul should be accordinated to solve the proble.

It should mainly depend upon income of people to decide whether the housing is provided or not.\n\n Major cities have many problems,housing being one of them. The main issues are lack of places for residential buildings and ever increasing commercial areas. This has resulted in people not having homes so they have to hire places and areas close to their civic centre are very expensive so they have to rent places at distant places . Furthermore , it will lead to the added cost of living. This problem can be solved at government level through adequate legislation, that a certain part of the city should be reserved for housing purposes . In addition ,huge fine can be imposed on any encroachments towards residential areas.\n\nGeneral public is paying taxes to the authorities so it is their responsibility to look after the people. For instance, low income or jobless people who are unable to build their homes should be facilitated , otherwise these people will spend their lives on road and be prone to immoral activities and drugs . \n\nIt is argued by some people that if the government starts building houses for people they will have to cut budget of other more important departments like health and education . As a result, these two most important factors which form the main pillars of society will be brought down.In my opinion , it can easily by managed if the budget is planned adequately.\n\nIn conclusion, the decisions made by government can solve problems of living of people ,so that people spend a comfortable life .",

Therefore, governments are burdened with the task to provide an effective and proper solution. I completely agree with the statement that its rule responsibility to mitigate these problems.\n\nCertainly, with the increase in population, people are forced to live in crowded areas subsidizing the standard of living. In other words, quality of life decrease substantially by this phenomena. In particular, inhibitors face security issues as with clogged streets, the crime rate increases and it cannot be controlled by individuals or society so authorities have to take action, such as enlarged in force units and installation of surveillance cameras, to overcome this problem. Additionally, growth in garbage production rate and air pollution caused by traffic is seen in these places leading to deteriorating environmental condition. \n\nMoreover, to evade the situation, families prefer to live in the suburbs, away from the main cities. These not only deprives them of basic facilities such as Hospital, which are mostly  situated in the centre, but also generate mobilization problems. For instance, it takes approximately one hour for commuters to reach the workplace from outskirts  for jobs. Communities cannot provide such facilities because of limited resources.

However, there is a debate regarding the spending amount of money since people believe that this money can use in other fields which give more benefit to humanity. I completely disagree with this opinion.\n\nTo begin with, exploration  out of the world is significant for humanâs future since World Space Agency (WSA) research shows that resources of the earth start to decrease because of some situations such as overpopulation or excess use of the car. In addition, another survey which is also done by WSA in 2020 published that people will suffer from a lack of clean water next few decades. For this reason, scientists begin to search for another planet like our world to maintain human life in the future. Therefore, the cost of these is obviously high, and saving the next life should be the most beneficial way for the investment. \n\nSecondly, recently earth has been the only known planet for life since humans have not  totally explored the other part of the universe. In other words, there may be some intelligent creatures in some parts of the space. Anyone does not know  whether they will threaten peopleâs life or not. In addition, some natural planet disasters can occur such as meteor crashes, and thanks to research, undesirable results may be avoided. As a result, humans should spend more money on space fields to protect themselves from unknowns.\n\nTo conclude, Although there are different notions on space exploration investments, I think that these are crucial for humanity, and even more money should spend on this area.",

    "essay": "These days, many couples opt for delayed childbirth. This trend can be attributed to career priorities. From my point of view, I consider that it has more drawbacks, especially the health of their offspring.\n\nOn the one hand, postponing parenthood can bring about significant advantages. Firstly, parents have financial stability after concentrating completely on their career. Therefore, children may receive a better education quality in a precious school. In addition, when pregnant at a later age, couples are more mature in emotional aspect, so their spouse relationship can become more stable. Furthermore, they would be ready to take care of their children. For instance, children who were born in families by elderly parents tend to be paid more attention than others since their parents have more family time.\n\nOn the other hand, embarking on parenthood at a later age can have unexpected disadvantages. First of all, that can increase the generation gap between parents and their offspring, leading to familial conflicts. In terms of the long run side, parents may not be around for as long as their children need them. Moreover, babies in such families are susceptible to mental diseases due to gene fault. As a case in point, according to health-related studies, infants who were born by mothers over 35 years old are prone to Down syndrome.\n\nTo sum up, opting for pregnancy at a later age can be because of heightened monetary burdens.

In this essay, I will explain the possible reasons of such a phenomenon and discuss pros and cons of it.\n\n   To begin with, the possible reasons why some couples decided to have a child in their later age are the positive aspects that it has. Firstly, in many countries, both men and women have an opportunity to make a career and become a well-paid employee. In this case, some pairs think that if their work and salary are stable, they will probably be able to care for their children more properly. Secondly, there are those who want to be more mentally prepared for having a toddler.

Eventually, she got a child when she was twenty six and felt herself very confidently. \n\n   On the other hand, there are some disadvantages of this situation. One of them is the possible health issues. In other words, the later a woman has a baby, the more negative consequences may happen. For instance, my aunt became a mother when she was thirty five and it was difficult for her because of her age. Unfortunately, it led to the fact that doctors had to make an operation to save her and toddler's life. Besides, youth usually has more strength and energy than middle-aged people.

I believe that it has more advantages as it is beneficial for living life in future. This essay will focus on the mentioned topic along with the relevant examples.\nFirst and foremost, the inflation all over the world has caused enormous problems which has resulted in financial issues of many people, it has even effected those who never considered having children would cost them a lot. These days, the cost of living per person has sharply risen then what was in the past which had made people think twice before having kids. For instance, if a baby is born in a family, the list of expenses starts then, that is, from the time of delivery to fulfilling basic needs like vaccines, school education, higher education and so on, therefore, considering these expenses people have stopped having children at an early age of their lives.\nFurthermore, the advantages of having children in the later years are more than in the past. Parents are more focused and settled in their careers and can provide their kids with good and quality living standards. In addition, they know the in and out of everything and the ways to deal with various things which help them live a better life.\nIn conclusion, I would say that having kids when parents are fully ready and settled with everything in their lives is a better option, whereas in contrast, the vice-versa wouldnât be that beneficial.

    "essay": "In recent decades, more and more individuals decide to delay their parenthood. Statistics show that the average age for parenthood rose to 30, nine years older than it was in 1970. The major reasons behind this trend are the increasing living costs, social changes, and personal hobbies. Even though a child later in life can lead to increased health risk for the woman and the baby, older parents are more financially stable and emotionally prepared which allows their children to properly grow physically and mentally.\n\nLiving prices have risen dramatically over the years, and having a kid is highly expensive, causing young couples to be hesitant. A child comes with an infinite number of additional costs, including medical, educational, and fundamental human requirements. These are costs that many young people cannot afford. Having a child necessitates a significant amount of personal time as well. A parent must devote time to caring for their infant, feeding them and cleaning up after them. A lot of young couples might not have the time required now that society has changed. Unlike society back in the early 20th century where people became parents at a much earlier age, every person now has to go to work, get higher education, and many other duties. Not only do young people need to fulfill their duties, they also need to satisfy their personal needs, such as traveling the world, focusing on their education, and working towards their career to improve their financial status. These are the main factors that encourage people to become parents at a later age in life.\n\nHaving children at an older age comes with both disadvantages and advantages. Giving birth at an older age increases the chance of miscarriage, which is harmful for the womanâs health afterwards. According to doctors, among women who are 35 or older, the rate of stillbirth is 5.8 per 1000 newborns. The baby also has a chance of a lighter birth weight, more abnormalities associated with chromosomes, and other negative outcomes. Despite the health concerns, later parental age comes with many advantages. It is proven that older parents are more economically free and educated. The reason being they had the chance to focus on their education and careers when they were young without having a child to hinder them from those activities. Being more financially stable and emotionally prepared are fundamental to the development of their child. For instance, with more economic freedom, the parents can be able to afford healthy foods and good medical products which ensures the childâs physical growth and health. They can  also give their kids more educational experiences at a young age, such as letting them travel to different places in the world and giving them access to good schooling. This allows the child to develop mentally and intelligently and unlock more opportunities in their future.\n\nIn essence, âthe main causes behind delayed parenthood are rising living costs, social changes, and personal interests. Even while having a child later in life increases the woman's and the baby's health risks, older parents are more financially stable and emotionally prepared, allowing their children to thrive physically and psychologically.",

    "essay": "Having children tend to be less popular in our generation now, many people decide to have children later in their life, and many of them don't even want to have kids. There are some reasons behind it, and they will be explained in the following paragraphs.\n\nFirst, the parenting costs are high. In the past, parents didn't have to spend too much time and pay too much attention to their children. However, due to the development of our society, parents want to give their kids the best life. Therefore, cultivating kids can be extremely expensive. Take China as an example. Chinese parents always pay considerably high parenting costs for kids' education, such as tutorials and home teachers. Hence, the parenting costs can be substantially high and exhausting because parents consistently need to keep an eye on their children. \n\nSecond, the matured welfare system. In the past, especially during wartime, human resources were precious; therefore, the government encouraged its people to have more kids. On the contrary, human resources are not essential now, and we don't really need our offspring to take care of our elder lives; the government can serve us well. Besides, on account of our developed medical condition, we can live quite a long time; thus, the fertility rate is bound to decrease. \n\nThird, women's social status has been promoted. Modern women have a high level of education, they know the risk of having kids on their bodies and careers. Hence, they have the right to decide when they give birth. \n\nIn conclusion, they are the three main reasons why more people decide to have children later in their life.",

In my opinion, I consider that parentâs decision to give birth in the later stage of life can bring about more advantages for the family when compared to minor drawbacks that it might bring.\nDespite the drawbacks mentioned below, I believe the benefits gained by the late childbirth are extremely useful for the whole family. The primary reason why a number of individual want have children later this choice allows them to have more time to find their passion and have fun when they are young. For instance, it is easier for a young couple to travel when they do not have baby to nurture. An additional reason is that people who are at an early stage of their career usually have lower income compare to when they are older. Therefore, many people decide to start raising a family after having accumulated enough money to ensure a better future for their children.\n\nAdmittedly, there are some issues involved when people want to have children in their middle age. One problem is that it has some detrimental effects on the society, this tendency might affect family life as having children later will cause a significant age gap between two generations and makes it harder for parents to understand and communicate with their offspring. Another negative aspect is that if people give birth when they are too old, the babies being born might be physically less healthy.  This might adversely affect the quality of the future workforce if too many people decide to follow this trend.\n\nIn conclusion, although tourists can have certain negative effects, it has an extremely positive influence on the economy as parents prefer having children in later stage because they want to improve their career and enjoy their social life.",

    "essay": "In the past, big families were more common than now, if one considers just Europe. Indeed, there were more than three children in each family. Instead, nowadays itâs rare to see big families, because couples decide to have children late in life. These families usually have children after their thirties or even forties.\nOne reason for this could be that women had less independence in the past. That is, they did not work, did not earn an own salary, or stayed home until they married. An advantage is that now women have more autonomy than before. But they would find complications with maternity leave, such as losing the job.\nAnother reason could be for financial stability. Couples likely deem this as necessary in order to ensure a comfortable life for them and for their children. A pro could be that they would not worry about being in debt. A con could be that they usually end up having just one child.\nOne last reason could be that having children later in life permits people to live more freely and have the possibility to continue with higher education. An advantage could be not having any regrets about experiences one could have had. However, a disadvantage would be having few or no children at all.\nTo sum up, at least in Europe people now prefer having children in their later lives because of more independence for women, the need for financial stability, the desire to have different experiences while young and to focus only on furthering education. One last disadvantage could be the reduction of the population by not procreating, but to me, the pros outweigh the cons.",

While some argue it has been plenty of negative for humans. In my opinion, I only can agree partly with the issues and this essay will explore more about the above problems.\n\nFirst, we will discuss the negative. There are so many reasons to talk about what affects people when we use them. Standing in the personâs perspective who witnessed tragedies when their offspring got game addicted person, which leads to plenty of problems about the development of children. In addition, they canât control their behaviours, and cause some crimes in society if they do not receive care from adults. For instance, a multitude of adults do not spend time with their children which leads to addiction syndromes in their offspring, and they are bad people and arenât helpful to the community. \n\nOn the other hand, we will talk about the positives when we depend on it. Standing in the personâs perspective who knows how to use technology the right way. In fact, a lot of parenthoods who allow their offspring to research information on the Internet but they have a control so strict with their offspring. This can be seen, in a multitude of children who have studying progress compared with their friends when they use machinery the right way. For example, when researching information at school, o lot of parents accept their offspring using technology sever for studying, which makes them progress more and more. \n\nIn conclusion, using technology is positive or negative it depend on the perspective of each individual.

In  contrast,  some nations ponder that machinery makes life complex, and  they do not want complexity in their lives. This opinion does not suit me. There are numerous things to deplete this idea.\n\nFirstly, After the invention of machinery, everything has become so easy and reachable. Supposing one person who works in a company , her boss gives a duty to her and this person feels inadequate to complete this task due to the fact she has no idea about this task and she oughts to learn how to handle it and she ascertains about this job everything which she needs via machinery, and she completes her duty. According to this example, technology has a key to reaching and learning new information, and it can be  useful for everybody.\n\nSecondly, there are a number of diseases around the world and so many people cope with these diseases. With machinery,  scientists can manufacture  a vaccine or remedy for ill society and they can save their life of them. Without using machinery and its developments, we would be leaving people to die.

Although I accept the former opinion, I believe that the latter is untrue. \n\nOn the one hand, nowadays, most people use social media such as Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok,.... for entertaining and networking purposes. Besides various compliments that people get from those sites, they also receive a lot of negative judgements about their bodies, lifestyles and behaviors that make them sad or even depressed. For another reason, we are living in a world which lacks connection between people, most of our relationships are through social media, resulting in a lack of thorough understanding of the true personality of each. Therefore, several arguments appear and make our lives very complicated. \n\nOn the other hand, despite the drawbacks which technology brings us, life without it will be even more terrible. Firstly, technology makes our lives more convenient, it saves us a huge amount of time. For example, in the past, if we had wanted 100 copies of a document, we would have had to write that document 100 times, but now, a print assists us, it can generate an unlimited number of copies that you want. Secondly, technology contributes to our learning process and it is also one of the top reasons why people are getting more and more intelligent. Today, just by sitting in front of a computerâs screen, we can easily access worldwide knowledge on the Internet, and becoming a master in our favorite areas has never been so easy. \n\nIn conclusion, in spite of the fact that technology triggers detrimental effects in our lives sometimes, I strongly believe that a life without it will be such a disaster.",

Although the advent of technology can make people's life complicated, it has increasingly played a remarkable role in our daily life.\n\nOn one hand, those people who argue technology can bring about complex possibilities to current life may offer certain convincing reasons. First of all, usage of technological products tends to cause squander an individual's time and energy. In other words, one needs to learn how to utilize them properly and fix the broken parts. It is quite difficult and tough for people to perform that, especially for the elderly and young children. Thus, these behaviours can waste time to some extent. In addition, it is likely that online activities contribute to a lack of security and financial loss. For example, It is personal information typed during online surfing that allows hackers to use it illegally. \n\nOn the other hand, technological improvements have provided us with great convenience and simplification. Firstly, some high-tech products extremely help people to do routine tasks, such as automatic washing machine and rice cooker, which might free hands from stifling housework and boost life efficiency. Secondly, the telecommunication tools are beneficial to cultivate bonded and imitate relationships. This means that mobile phones and video chats enable students who study abroad to communicate with their parents and friends immediately without spending much time on commuting to post office and waiting for replies. Therefore, technology is potential to maintain a closer connection with other people.\n\nIn conclusion, technology alters people's life to become simple and enhance live standards, but there are certain counterproductive impacts on quality of life.

Some people hold the opinion that we ought not to use technology due to the fact that it makes life complex, I disagree with this points and will make an objective analysis in the following essay.\n\nOn the one hand, the advance of modern technology makes our life more complex than in the past to some extents, especially for our jobs. For instance, journalists just need to write reports several decades ago. Nowadays, they need to take photos and videos, even managing social medias because of the development of communication technology.

Even though we can change our habits, it will pay for a great deal of costs. It need to be considered clearly whether it is worthwhile just to make so-called simple life.

This essay will discuss why I moderately agree with this proposition because of undeniable advantages of technology and its disadvantages.\n\t\tTo begin with, several modern conveniences are born with the help of technology. People can get approach to a huge amount of information via online database in every facet of life. As a matter of fact, if they are connected to the Internet, tons of specific pieces of information can be searched in less than one second. In addition, not only does automation set free millions of workers from monotonous and arduous working environment but also it improves the efficiency of society. But more fundamentally, emails and mobile phones have replaced old ways of communicating which facilitate contacting processes with business partners.\n\t\tHowever, there are also negative effects of technology that make people argue against using it. Firstly, a surprisingly increase in the number of cyber attacks would be witnessed if people make use of the Internet for bad purposes. Cyber hackers will steal personal information of users to purchase. Secondly, false or misleading information will disappoint people in several ways because of not being censored. Finally, genetically modified food directly poses a threat to our health due to its insecurity. \n\t\tThis essay argued why higher efficiency and greater technological applications complicate our lives and mentioned the negative effects of technology that makes some people suggest to live without it.

    "essay": "The alarming rise in obesity rates, where people are becoming seriously overweight, has fueled debates on effective solutions. A popular proposal calls for raising the prices of high-calorie foods to reduce consumption. While this fiscal strategy has some merit, I argue that it is overly simplistic, neglects the impact on economically disadvantaged groups, and fails to address the multifaceted nature of the obesity epidemic.\n\nIn the lexicon of economic theory, the principles of supply and demand are more than theoretical constructs; they wield an undeniable influence over consumer behaviour. This has been conspicuously validated by Mexicoâs sugar tax policy, which triggered a marked decline in soda sales. Yet, the seemingly resplendent success of such a fiscal strategy masks the bleaker and more complex realities of socioeconomic inequality. Raising the cost of calorie-rich foods could inadvertently instate a 'nutritional divide,' making balanced diets a rarified luxury that only the affluent can regularly afford, thus entrenching a cycle of poverty and deteriorating health.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, the mounting complexities tied to the surge in obesity ratesâwhere people are becoming seriously overweightâcannot be solved by economics alone. Scandinavian countries, in spite of their elevated food prices, demonstrate remarkably lower obesity prevalence. The secret lies in a multi-pronged public health strategy that extends far beyond economic disincentives. It encompasses educational campaigns, meticulously designed urban spaces conducive to physical activity, and stringent food-labelling laws that are transparent and informative. These varied elements synergistically forge a nuanced, comprehensive strategy, transcending economic solutions to offer a socially equitable and sustainable approach to a pervasive public health crisis.\n\nIn summary, the notion of augmenting food prices, while superficially appealing, is myopic and fraught with economic inequities. The genuine panacea resides in an integrative, multidisciplinary blueprint that couples fiscal levers with educational and environmental reform, thereby ensuring a sustainable and inclusive resolution to this burgeoning health epidemic.",

Some people recommand that the price of junk food should be raised to tackle this problem, while in my opinion, it might be helpful to some extant, but there are other measures that are more effective to address this issue better.\n\nOn the one hand, admittedly, rising the price of junk food can help to shape the consumers' eating habits. Firstly, consumers would seek alternative options over sugary and fast foods due to limited budget. If the unhealth foods, such as cheese burgars, pizzas and sodas cost too much, people would rather choose some cost-effective and low-calorie products to minimize the food expense.\n\nIn addition, increasing the price of fat food is actually make the food producer losing some of the markets and reducing sales profits. In this way, food manufactures will forced to develop more green food, such as sugar-free beverages and calories-free sandwiches.\n\nOn the other hand, simply increasing the price of unhealth food cannot eliminate the obesity besause the rationale of this problem is unhealth lifestyle of modern people. Therefore, more methods are required to mitigate public overweight issue. To start with, government should take the responsbility to take some actions to raise citizens' awareness of the serious consequency of unhealth lifestyle. For instance, regime could invitie some expertise to host some lessons to teach people how to keep good eating habits and keep in good shape. Besides, government should invest money on fitness facilities. For example, building more sports arenas that are open freely to public and encourage people to do regular exercises.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe raising the price of unhealth food is not the only way to help obese people, there are other more effective way that government should put efforts on.",

However, I personally agree with this statement which will be discussed in this essay before a rational conclusion. \n \nThis problem is one of a serious matter of health. First and foremost, the high price of fast food would confine them to buy anything what they want to eat. It is highly likely that the restriction of food shopping could reduce their much more daily consumption. When they do not buy various kinds of fattening food, for example, their diet could be controlled properly. Furthermore, the relation of economic cost and healthy eating are extremely strong, since, it is helpful to fulfil their food needs. Therefore, the policy maker also have to insist the seller of healthy foods to reduce its price and to increase the price of unhealthy foods. This would automatically lead them to shop the cheap item. \n\nOn the other hand, the obese people would also try to manage their consumption, if the price of their fattening food becomes expensive. By means that they have to divide their money not only on food, but also to the other necessities. It means that the government has to change their focus onto the other things instead of food. Moreover, the level of health among society is one of the main important elements of government to control. Thereby, the cooperation between economic sectors and policy maker should be persistent in determining the price of fast food in their region. \n\nBy way of conclusion, though, the instant foods are always provided by several markets, yet the price could be controlled well to reduce the vast majority of consumers, by giving them the high price. Besides, the lowering price of healthy food would be the best choice for keeping a stability health. As I would restate that controlling the economic cost, especially on food will support the over consumption of obese persons.",

It is argued by some people that raising the money of high-fat items will reduce its consumption and thereby peopleâs overweight issue will be addressed. I disagree with the opinion because some people are addicted to fast food which contains high amount of fat and simply increasing the price will not cut down their fat intake. There are some other additional reasons for my view which will be stated in this essay.\n\nThe most compelling reason for holding my view is that many youngsters are not ready to avoid ready-made food and its unique taste just because of a rise in price. Therefore, they continue to consume high-fat food items and ignore their health problems. For instance, McDonaldâs outlets around the world deliver food which contains enormous amount of saturated fat. However, a study found that most people prefer McDonald food over healthy alternatives because of its distinctive taste. Thus, people are ready to buy those foods even for a higher price.\n\nSecondly, high-fat foods are not the only reason for obesity among people. Nowadays, a large number of people are leading a sedentary lifestyle which is considered as one of the major reasons for obesity. Therefore, physical exercise plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy body. Due to this reason, increasing the price of fatty foods does not solely address the overweight problem.\n\nIn conclusion, I totally disagree with the opinion that high cost of  food causing obase is the ideal solution to control it . Public are ready to pay anything for foods which are easily available and having pleasant taste even if the fat content is higher. In addition, I believe that encouraging / promoting physical exercise is more crucial for maintaining body weight than regulating fatty food.",

Among the bad, fast foods are a major concern because of which the average weight of the people is increasing dramatically. Some individuals argue that the only solution for this problem is to increase the prices of these foods. I do not agree with the statement. \nThere are numerous studies which are showing that the weight of the people is increasing due to the changing food priorities. This public health epidemic needs to be addressed at the earliest, the first step that needs to be considered is, rising an awareness among the public about the side effects of the street food or the high calorie foods like the burgers and the pizzas. Second step is to encourage the public to take part in regular cardiovascular exercises. Just by increasing the prices of the high fatty foods will not solve the problem, it has to be the combination of multiple other methods. \nMultinational food corporations have a major role in this public health hazard, authorities should implement strict laws to bring the accountability. For example, In India food chains like KFC and pizza hut doesnât show the calorie count on the menu because of which, some individuals might consider eating them eating all the time. If the calorie and nutrient index is displayed, it will create an awareness among the general public. \nTo conclude, sticking to one method will not yield the desired results.

Principally the advance of technology and the human culture generations are the main causes. In my point of view, these problems can be solved by several solutions and this essay will illustrate the causes and the solutions for these problems.\n\nFirstly, the rise of gadgets and the advance of automation will influence the students at school. All pupils try to manage everything and change the method of the learning by  artificial intelligence. For instance, all students use cell phones or AI Apps to look for the answers of the questions or to do homework. It is very popular nowadays because we can find the answer quickly rather than read the book. As a result, the school should make an innovation to combine machinery and conventional methods to make learning more attractive if they want to make students pay attention.  \n\nIn addition, the gap between the human generation shows culture affects learning growth. We can see how many people 30 years ago chose to read  printed books and compared to the pupils that mostly the millennial generation prefer to use AI as their solution to find the material for their assignment. For example, students need an hour to read books on the other hand it tooks a minute by used AI. So, these problems may decrease their focus and affect their learning progress at school because they think using AI Apps more easier. To deal with this issue we can make the learning process more effective by using the discussion method. All the student have the same opportunity to talk about their task and make comparisons. \n\nIn conclusion, after a thorough analysis of the given topic, to increase the student's focus at school the growth of technology and human generation is the major cause and we can combine the methodology of  learning development by using technology to solve the problem.",

Furthermore, most of the students are addicted to new technology and they try to find as much time as they could to play. As can be expected, it bothers their focus since everything they think is only posting new TikTok. Equally, the atmosphere in the classroom effect whether pupils can concentrate or not. It is obvious that it is hard to pay attention in a dark room without any new equipments.Â \n\nOne immediate practical solution is to prohibit kids to bring their mobile phones to school and limiting sitting in social media. Likewise, rooms should be fulfilled with needed tew technologies to encourage students to learn and this issue could be solved by government. For instance, the school for gifted pupils in Pavlodar restricted to bring mobile phones to school, the alternative is that pupils who brought cellphone to school, put them into the box before the lessons, and instead of using them they are being enticed with new technologies. It is a good illustration of solution as pupils are not interested in phones anymore as they are fully focused on subjects in great conditions that was proposed by government.\n\nIn conclusion, there are several reasons why students have problems with focusing and one of them is being distracted by phone and having bad conditions in the classroom. Possible solutions are to ban bringing cellphones to school and the local government should invest in appropriate conditions at schools.",

Another reasons is that nowadays these juveniles are very enthusiastic, they want to get everything in their life very early. therfore, insted of living in present with full attention they waste their precious time thinking about future. \n\nOn the other hand, to resolve these problems public and government both should have to perform their duties otherwise it will be a disaster for student in future. for resolve this problem parents need to keep eye on their kids and let them know that they should not spend their precious time spending on scrolling facebook and instagram. goverment should work with these social media compnies and make some restriction of using these platfarms.  \n\nIn conclusion, despite the ubiquity of mobile phone, if parents and government take stick action against social media applications they can do a great care of their childrent and citizen.",

In addition, learning something can be challenging for students as they desire to entertain with other things such as music, playing football etc. Furthermore, pupils can be independent people in their life period without any restrictions so they do not want to pay attention to lectures in school regularly. For instance, they are bored when they attend  lectures for learning some subjects ,also many parents can pressure  their children and this reason can lead to some permanent problems.\n\nOn the other hand,  both societies and governments should be taught how to deal with these issues  accurately for students.

In the following essay ,this writer wishes to further elaborate on this .\n\nto begin with , students in this millennium live with technology and, some of them like video gaming  may negatively affect their studies . Unfortunately , most of the students who are addicted to these new technologies will  give less attention to their studies and they try to find  time for gaming.At the same time , schools also do not stimulate students  for their studies and continue the old methods of teaching , which find some students to  fed up.

    "essay": "Most students suffer from a lack of concentration at school these days. Electronic beams coming from electronic devices are one of the primary causes of this issue. This problem can be solved by increasing the students' awareness about the negative impact of using these devices for a long time on their mental abilities. \n\nThis issue is mainly caused by rays of electronic devices, such as Ipad, mobile phones, and video games. This is because pupils are spending most of their time on using these devices without any protection from beams' threats. There has been strong evidence indicating that over usage of video games has made it more challenging for children to understand their teachers' lectures due to lack of sleep and headaches. As a consequence, this problem might shake pupils' confidence, and therefore it pushes them toward quitting their studies. \n\nThe solution to this problem is by educating pupils about the negative impact of this cause on the span of their attention. The school could launch educational campaigns to increase its students' awareness about this problem and how they can use electronic devices safely without affecting their intellectual capacities. Schools in Abu Dhabi organize various events that focus on showing students movies about what would happen to them if they kept continuing playing video games for more than 6 hours every day. These events have open students' minds about this issue and encouraged them to look for activities that increase their attention. \n\nTo sum up, the short span of attention has been considered a major challenge for the majority of students at school. Using electronic equipment for a long time has significantly contributed to this issue due to dangerous beams coming from these devices. However, it can be solved by providing students more knowledge about this problem through effective campaigns at their schools.",

    "essay": "Education is very important in everyoneâs life. Majority of students feel it difficult to concentrate or pay attention at school nowadays. There are many reasons for the above mentioned statement. I will explain the reasons in the following essay.\n\nFirst of all, social media has a very good role to distract the students from their studies. For example, social media platforms like, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter  and Whatsapp are the trending social media sites all around the world. Whatever things happens in their life like happy or sad matters, they upload on the social media. So every friends can see and comment about it as well as like  it. If a student post something on the social media, he will keep on  checking it  to read the comment and the number of likes he received. Youtube is also an app uses to watch videos. Even if we open the app to search the study material, advertisements will come to distract in the form of other interested topics like tv shows, film clipping, musics, cartoons and games so on.\n\nFor a student no need a phone in fact. If it is very necessary to have a phone, parents can provide them basic call facility mobile phones. Once they are at home parent can keep the phone with them. Whenever they use the phone, parent can keep an eye on it, so they can have an idea that what the kid is using with the app. Moreover, parent can make a time table for the kidsâ and mother or parent can check wheather children are stick to the timetable or not.",

In addition,another app named  \"WhatsApp\" is also playing a important role.It can be used for business many people use this app for their business and you can also get news updates by WhatsApp channel created by the different TV channels.\n\nIn contrast,some people have rational views.They think social media can easily distract someone from their main focus.For instance,a really big problem is in students who misuse these things.They use these apps all day and this enables the lack of interest in studies.Besides this,people also miss-guide \n\nindividuals by fake news.There should be a check by the Government for that purpose.\n\nIn sum ,by carefully observing the plus and negative points as far as I am concerned,Social media has some disadvantages.Despite that, these are more helpful for everyone.Overall,the pros overcome the cons.",

    "essay": "In the digital age, social media is closely intertwined with our lives. Checking  messages from  social media is one thing that most   people do every day. Also, the young generation gets news information through social media, too.To me, the pros of social media are way more than the cons. I will elaborate on my view in the following paragraphs.\n\nOn the one hand, social media provide a voice platform for everyone, there are many internet celebrities who have become famous through  social media, and they get  opportunities they transform their life. For instance, a beauty influencer called Charlie was born in a poor family. However, she has a great interest in makeup products, as a result, she has shown many makeup skills on  Instagram  and gradually became famous. Later on, she established her own brand and earned plenty of money. Moreover, social media has shortened the distance between people around the world. People from different countries get to know each other through the apps on their phones, this also helps eliminate the stereotypes  of different races. Additionally, social media strengthens the connection between family and friends.Individuals can keep in touch with someone they care about easily even if they are separated at vast distances.\n\nOn the other hand, social media also causes trouble. Firstly, people always show their best part of life on  social platforms, hence the idealized representation on  social media might cause  unrealistic expectations of real life, eventually leading to mental health issues for individuals and societies.\n\nSecondly,social media can serve as a breeding ground for misinformation. In 2018, there was a diploma named Su Chi-cheng, he committed suicide after being bullied by a netizen. The trigger of this tragedy is fake news which has never been confirmed.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some drawbacks to the utilization of social media, we can overcome them by improving the communityâs  media literacy and the ability to think independently.The capacity of global connectivity  and information communication is incredible.Therefore, I believe the benefits of social media  far outweigh the shortcomings.",

In past, communication was not that much easier, however, nowadays it is very convenient to connect with anyone sitting in any part of the world due to technological advancement. Secondly, we can easily be aware of what is happening in the world. For example, media plays a vital role in giving daily updates of whatever is happening in today's world. Thus, social media and technological advancement has made life easier. \n\nOn the contrary, social media also has some disadvantages. They are, excessive use of social media which has adverse effects on human health, such as eyesight defects and inappropriate use of social media. Although social media has minor attractive pros, it also has some demerits. In other words, overuse of anything is bad. Similarly, mobile phone apps should be used in limit and parents should monitor the usage of their children. In addition to that, nowadays too much use of social media has affected human eyes severely. For example, according to a survey conducted by a renowned organization, a large number of people are using mobile applications inappropriately using fake identities.

    "essay": "With the development of the internet, more and more social media were widely used by human beings. While some people argue that it may bring about some positive impacts, I believe that they are more likely to contribute to negative influences.\n\nSocial media benefit our daily life. To begin with, without regional restrictions, we are able to keep in touch with other people in different countries. For instance, an innovative social media, which is named LinkedIn, could effectively help job seekers apply for overseas occupations as well as contact foreign human resources specialists from international enterprises. In addition, people can maintain the relationship more easily through a variety of social media. In this fast-paced life, it is common that we cannot always meet our friends and family; whereas this may cause us to become more and more alienated from close people. As a result, social media significantly dissolve regional and time limitations and support us to strengthen bonds with others.\n\nNevertheless, there are several negative problems that come along with social media. Firstly, without censorship, they may spread illegal and fake news to the public and even harm children. As we know, at a younger age, children are so ignorant and immature that they cannot distinguish between the truth and the fake information on social media. In this context, if juveniles are exposed to violent elements, they may blindly duplicate violent behaviours. Afterwards, it is likely to lead to a rising rate of crime such as school bullying, robbery, and so on. Therefore, social media exert a baneful impact on society.\n\nIn conclusion, despite some contact benefits, social media seem to me that those cause more disadvantages and are harmful to us.",

In this essay, I will present both perspectives and provide my own viewpoint.\n\nNowadays, having a university education is a standard requirement to be employed in a good company and earn a high salary. In other words, most organizations require their employees to have at least a bachelor's degree. For instance, in Thailand, the university from which a person graduates can determine the company they can join. The more reputable the university, the better the job position. In contrast, individuals with lower education levels can only become labourers or workers.\n\nOn the other hand, some people can become successful without university degrees. For example, the most popular social media platform, Facebook, was established by a university student who later decided to drop out of school to pursue his career. That is to say, one can achieve success in their career without a university degree. However, the chances are slim for ordinary people, with the possibility being only one in a million. To succeed at lower education levels requires talent, money, and luck, and most people do not possess all of these requirements.\n\nIn conclusion, while some individuals may attain successful careers, the likelihood that this will occur for most people is low.

This part of technology has some benefits and drawbacks which in this essay will be discussed, also,I firmly believe that the number of its advantages is more than its disadvantages.\n\nThe first area to consider is the wide range of information and data access caused by social media. To be more specific, there are a number of platforms on which people are able to go to a global village by them and get or share data there. For example, by using some applications like Twitter and Whatsapp they can connect to each other to take or get information to update their knowledge. Also, Students use YouTube and other websites constantly to get  data and even attend online classes. In addition, people can have an online shop in this area to sell their products. It is a great method for shopping that is easy for both sellers and customers.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many phoney profiles and manipulated data on social network since some people change data to suit their personal need and publish false information whose credential is questioned, also, internet fraud is another issue in online shopping.\n\nIn addition, social network without censorship is harmful to children and youngsters as they are exposed to violence and immorality. Moreover, youngsters can not picture their fulfilment in the absence of social media and without the internet they feel paralysed which leads to becoming addicted to networks.\n\nTo conclude, despite having negative effects on using social media, I hold the opinion that this advanced technology is helpful for all people in their life and is effective in people's success.",

Instead of traditional methods, people prefer to use them as the way to obtain new information. From my perspective, in general, more advantages occur. \n\nThere is a doubtless limitation for public to read news by social medias - possibility of having fake reports is relatively high because publishers are not all qualified; simultaneously, there is no supervision from the authority. Hence, if there was a fake report released, negative influence might exist. For instance, entertainment section on social medias always publishes articles about a celebrity's actions which are made up. Not only do they harm celebrities' reputation, but also occupy excess social resources. \n\nHowever, positive effects are various. For individuals, it is a more effective way to contact with the external world. For example, on WeChat, all public masses have their official accounts where they establish an omni-channel to provide people with services. Therefore, consumers only need to scroll their screens whenever they have leisure time and wherever they are. \n\nMoreover, from government, it is also a representation of enhancing democracy of the nation. Based on John Mill's political philosophy theory, a democratic polity should not prohibit citizens from the freedom of speech. What the social medias are capable of is allowing people to express their own ideas. Thus, for the government, it is beneficial to allow various information on the social medias. \n\nIn conclusion, although there is a probobility of the existance of fake news, people can still aquire more information in an effective way, while it is also a symbol of democracy of a government.

It can be observed that a large number of people are drawing attention to how people keep on track with new occasions or make friends with people on social media. As far as I am concerned, I personally think there are more drawbacks than benefits, and my essay will shed light on both sides of the view.\n\nOn one hand, it is a well-documented fact that the Internet is free, always available and individuals can text no matter where they are. One example to prove this is that 850 million people in China have participated in the Internet for communicating purposes, which is 70% of their population. Moreover, new generations who are extremely adaptable and interested in technology find this method suitable for their style of talking and gathering information. As a result, developing countries are more than happy about the effects of this trend.\n\nOn the other hand, it is undeniable that chatting online will prevent people from seeing others' interactions and expressions. For example, if you say \"sorry\" to your friend and you receive an \"okay\" from them, you have no clue whether they forgive you or not. In addition to this, direct talking plays a vital part in people's communication, being able to notice people's emotions and intentions could help conversation become fairly straightforward to understand and strengthen relationships. Besides that, being active frequently on  social platforms could put your health conditions at risk, According to scientific research, people should only use the Internet for a maximum of 2 hours a day to avoid diseases including headaches and eyestrain.\n\nTo conclude, notwithstanding the fact that social media is incredibly helpful in terms of availability and unlimited resources, the trend is exerting detrimental impacts on the way people communicate and their physical state",

While there are some drawbacks associated with using social media, I believe the main benefits are more substantial. This essay will argue that the advantages of this outweigh the drawbacks.\n\nOn the one hand, a primary advantage of using social media is that connections are made effortlessly regardless of the location or time. Hence, it helps many individuals who were immigrated to another country to make a connection with their relatives just by pressing a click. For example, it is so convenient for parents whose children study abroad to make a video call daily. In addition, due to the technological advancements in applications, various information is speared quickly, therefore, anyone can access the latest news. For instance, football fans are able to know the latest live football results on their way home.\n\nOn the other hand, a potential disadvantage of the existence of social media may be that each person would waste a lot of time on these social websites while it could be handled by time management. Also, people are maybe influenced by fake news published on such websites which provides some unreal content.

However, there is actually no evidence to support this view.\n\nIn conclusion, using social media would indeed seem disadvantageous under certain circumstances.

    "essay": "Some people use social networking sites for regularly updating themselves with current news and for keeping in touch with friends and family. In my opinion, using social media brings more disadvantages compared to any benefits it might bring.\nAdmittedly, there are some advantages of using social media. Firstly, social networking sites provides a fast and easy means of communication. People can anything and anywhere get in touch with friends and relatives. From any part of the globe, it is convenient for anyone to see videos, photos and posts of their closed ones. Secondly, people gets updated with latest news and reports. Real time information relating to global, social and economic matters is available on social media sites in just a few clicks. Also many of the social networking sites like Instagram or Facebook are free and provides an easy user interface.\nNevertheless, despite the advantages above, I believe that social media have more detrimental effects. Cyber crimes have been on the rise, with increasing use of social media. Many frauds use fake identities, to take unfair or unjust advantage of others, which might be for monetary purpose or revenge. People are becoming more unsocial, often lacking to take out time for those who are living along. Also, fake news is most easily circulated on social sites, with an intention of misguiding the local masses. Many innocent can get misguided and this can have dangerous effects on a society or a country as a whole. Lastly, social networking sites tends to brain wash common people by directly attacking their sentiments and thinking, through news or advertisements.\nIn conclusion, though people vary in their opinions, I believe that social media have more adverse effects on individuals and society, rather than advantages.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, there is a big deal of countries with their various culture, traditions, customs and level of life. Many people  have a lot of opportunities and variative choice where to have a rest or live. Thats why there is a trend of selecting to travel abroad instead of doing research on the motherland. Mostly, this adventure beneficially influences to our society ,however there is also another side.\n\nTo begin, basically lives of people have dramatically changed. A few years ago, in order to get to a certain destination, an individual had to donate his time, a large amount of cash and other staff. Today, with highly developed technologies, increased lifestyle, numerous public have much more opportunities and resources, to choose more interesting places to live or travel. So instead of having a journey in the area that they are already aware about, they decide to look at totally different culture, countries. For example, in the past, in order to get to certain destination in one side of the country from another, a few mothes were demanded, while in modern times, it requires 9 hours to get from Uzbekistan to USA. Another reason, is that person has a desire to reach better life style, than in the country where he lives.\n\nOn the other hand, person will not have strong senses to motherland. In other words, the individual may begin to think about town where his was born, simply like ground and no more. For instanse, when person has myriad countries to compare, he most likely will look at area with high life style, and may start to look negatively, to the motherland. However, in my opinion this situation is uncommon. On other hand, he would start to consider than his motherland is whole Earth rather than a certain piece of it.\n\nIn conclusion, large amount of people nowadays have enough resourses to search better lands to travel. This trend, provides humanity with more benefitial sides rather than inferior ones. It is important to mention, that humanity, everyday icrease the speed of development, and many persons increase their life every single day, so it eould be incorrect to say that, this adventure inferiorly impacts on humanity",

Despite it has some harmful sides, I mostly agree with that televison is educational for children.\n\nOn one hand, watching television regularly causing them to spend most of their time staring at one point in front of the television. Due to they are sitting at one place all day, they may become lazy as that kind of children prefer watching televison or playing online games rather than playing outside with their friends. This can affect their communicativity which may apart them fromÂ  their peers.\n\nOn the other hand, television offers a plethora of educational programs that stimulate children's curiosity and enhance their learning experience. Channels dedicated to science, history, and nature provide engaging content, fostering a love for knowledge. Additionally, televison introduces children to diverse cultures, promoting a global perspective. Through documentaries, travel shows, and international programming, children gain insight into the rich tapestry of the world. Well-crafted children's programs encourage creativity and imaginative thinking. Animated shows and series with positive themes contribute to the development of a child's storytelling abilities and problem-solving skills.\n\nIn conclusion, television for children is a double-edged sword, offering educational enrichment while posing potential risks. By conscientiously managing screen time and content, parents can harness the positive aspects of television, ensuring a healthy and constructive viewing experience for their children.",

    "essay": "One of the primary passing time activities for children is watching TV. Yet, a rising argument revolving around how TV contribute to a child's behaviour is going viral. Some people believe that the content is the main factor affecting how children act. Meanwhile, others find that the hours spent on TV are more likely to influence how they behave. Accordingly, this essay will discuss both views and then I will provide my opinion. \n\nOn the one hand, many individuals say that focusing on what children watch is highly significant. In other words, they argue that tv shows, cartoons or movies affect how the child behave in terms of speaking, manners and actions. For example, many little ones act violently when they watch action cartoons. Additionally, young girls sometimes would act like princesses, fairies, and pet animals depending on what they watch. By considering these instances, they aid this side of the argument significantly. \n\nOn the other hand, there are those who are concerned with the watching duration limits for children. The more a lad spends time on TV the higher possibility his behaviour will change. Many parents stated that when their offspring watch television more than usual, they tend to get absent-minded, violent and restless. For instance, a little boy's condition was diagnosed of slow cognitive processing caused by staying overtime watching kids' shows and the lack of staying active with his family. \n\nPersonally speaking, I believe that both views are valid and certainly contribute to children's behaviour. However, the former could influence the child positively if parents restricted specific content such as, educational and musical shows which can establish the creativity and learning abilities in children. On the contrary, the latter's effect appears disadvantageous to the young ones isolating them from social and domestic interactions.\n\nIn conclusion, children's constant exposure to TV definitely affects their behaviour. However, parents can determine the duration limit and type of shows their kids watch and, thus, avoid the negative impacts on their little ones.",

Some believe watching tv programs aids in shaping a minor's developmental process as he/she ages, while the other group assumes it's not effective and the cons side is heavier than the pros.\n\nOn the one hand, It is believed that offspring who watch TV programs, tend to be more obese than others when they grow up. This is due to their habit formation during childhood, Sitting in front of an LCD and not having physical activity. Another reason which made these groups of people against TV  is that there are fewer age-limited animations and movies for kids nowadays, Which could lead to early puberty in those kids. Moreover, Juniors who are constantly watching TV while being too close to the screen, is proven to have eyesight problem in teen ages.\n\nOn the other hand, Advocates of the discussed theory, which is my own opinion on the subject, believe that all mentioned effects of watching TV, could be prevented by parents, if there is controlled and limited time during the day when a kid is allowed to watch their favourite cartoon. It's not only safe and enjoyable for the kid, But also prompt their mental and social skills growth, by being familiar with social greetings and different culture and it will help to shape a personality feature named \"acceptance\". Hence, adding physical activity during the day  could prevent obesity. Furthermore, children who grow up watching TV can perform social interactions more easily, during a process called \"modelling\". It is obtained through ages of observation of educational programs on TV.\n\nIn conclusion, there are different rationales among parents on TV watching habits in children. While it could prompt the modelling and acceptance of mental processes and behaviours, it couldCorrespondingly cause eye-related conditions in the long term and it is up to parents to choose between options.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, many parents prohibit their offspring from using electronic devices  but allow them to watch TV as a pastime substitute. Some people believe watching TV is beneficial for  children to obtain new knowledge, but others oppose it. In my opinion, I consider that watching TV has a positive impact on kids' development. I will discuss both views in the following essay.\n\nTo  begin with, it is undeniable that watching TV every day is damaging to kids' health. For instance, some TV dramas have tight spots which are able to attract viewers to watch every episode, this can lead to children losing their interest in participating in outdoor activities which will deprive them from some opportunities to exercise. In addition, kids who stare at the screen for hours can damage their vision. Therefore, watching TV every day has some disadvantages to children's growth.\n\nOn the other hand, unlike the motley content presented on smartphones, content from TV is usually produced by practitioners, which means they are more serious and practical which can weight to expand kids' knowledge. For example, children can experience the wonders of species evolution by watching wildlife documentaries, which are difficult to feel from textbooks. Thus, children can learn new things by watching appropriate TV programs.\n\nIn conclusion, children spending hours every day on their television is not conducive to their wellness and growth, but parents provide their offspring with meaningful TV programs that can help them understand this world more. Accordingly, I agree it is beneficial for children by watching positive programs.",

    "essay": "It is frequently believed that the content which children watch on television affects their behaviour, while there are others who assume that watching duration on television gives the worst effect. In my view, what adolescents enjoy on television definitely influences them a lot compared with the time spent.  \n\nSpending a long duration keeping their eyes on the television drives at least two effects on adolescents, both physically and psychologically. Toddlers are exposed by dangerous light from television and this provokes a hazardous impact on their health and might lead to temporary blindness if they watch the television excessively. Moreover, they might suffer from obesity because they extremely enjoy it and limit their body movement. Another impact generated from this phenomenon is their interaction with their peers. It is better for them to hang out with their friends and bond the relationship instead of wasting a long time rooted facing the television. \n\nIn tandem with this, television content is getting developed right now. People of vary ages can easily access the show on television including children. The advertisement published in the media persuades them to spend their money on unnecessary goods such as toys and unhealthy food. Not only that, the worst impact is the crime that possibly affects their behaviour. The massive publication of alcohol, narcotics and pornography increases their curiosity to try. Undoubtedly, if parents only paid little attention to them, this might increase the crime rate in the country. \n\nIn conclusion, advertisements and inappropriate publications on television highly affect toddlers' behaviour in comparison with the long duration spent, and parents should guide them a lot to face this challenging phenomenon. The lack of attention of the parents might provoke the children to commit the crime perpetually.",

I believe that both factors can affect children's behaviour, however, I mostly agree with the statement that spent period of time is influencing more.\n\n   Most of the time adults turn on the device to use it as a distraction and to have a break for themselves, therefore it can become unnoticed that some channels may be changed by remote. However, in my opinion, not only they can choose to watch \"horrific\" things but always are able to come across scientific or historical channels that can catch a small one's attention to dig into interesting topics at a young age, hence television influence is positive.\n\n     Although the television has its good sides I think that parents should pay more attention to the spent period of time because it has lots of negative side effects, for example, kids can get obsessive and evolve aggressive behaviour to get what they want, that is, to watch more of their favourite cartoons or shows, also there may appear eyesight problem and lose motivation to go outside and contact with other youngsters.\n\n     In summary, both of the factors have huge affection on psychological development and behaviour, but I believe that usually negative things could arise if people spend too much time watching TV.

    "essay": "Televisions can certainly bring a change in a childâs attitude, be it good or bad. Though some reckon that the type of content being watched has a greater impact in bringing that change, others hold the duration for which the content is being watched more responsible for this. In my opinion, it is dependent on both the factors combined.\n\nPeople consider content being consumed on TV important because little ones have no idea of what is good or bad for them. Since a childâs brain is like a clean state and works like a sponge, it gets easily affected by every new stimulus they come across, especially on TV. For example, many youngsters wish to be like their favourite superheroes after watching movies like Avengers. In case the parents are not careful with the kind of TV shows their infant is consuming, they may end up developing habits that can be harmful in long term. So many individuals feel the variety of TV media watched has a great impact on their pupilâs attitudes.\n\nOn the other hand, the timings for which the child consumes any content are equally significant. If young ones spend too much time in front of the TV, it can harm them in two ways. Firstly, they would not have enough time left to learn anything else and that would seriously hamper their overall growth. Secondly, too much  screen time can have adverse effects on the childâs eyesight which is a very concerning issue at an early age. Thus, the number of hours spent on TV can also strongly influence a childâs behaviour.\n\nIn conclusion, a childâs lifestyle is greatly affected by what they watch and how they long they watch it on TV.

    "essay": "While it is true that watching TV affects children, it is difficult to determine  whether it is the content of the programs or the length of time spent watching  them that has a more significant impact on children. It seems to me that  although the amount of time does affect youngsters, it is the content of the  programs that has a more marked influence on them.  On the one hand, the consequences of watching TV for long periods of time  can be deleterious. Firstly, the longer children are exposed to TV programs,  the more likely it is for them to become addicted to watching television.  When children become over-reliant on television for entertainment, they  might neglect engagement in outdoor activities. This may result in a  sedentary lifestyle that is highly detrimental to their physical health. More  importantly, excessive TV watching impairs childrenâs communication  abilities, so they find it hard to play or live in harmony with others. As a  result, children would feel discouraged from having real interactions with  people around them if they spent a huge amount of time in front of the  screen, which may hinder their development of social skills.  On the other hand, it is the broadcasted images that have the most direct  effects on young viewers. Firstly, in most countries the majority of TV shows  present glamorized depictions of inappropriate materials such as violence,  drug abuse or casual sex, thus youngsters may adopt unhealthy habits and  improper behavior. For example, they might fall under the impression that the  use of alcoholic drinks is fashionable without being aware of the health risks  they carry and later end up consuming these substances. Besides, in our  modern consumer society, commercials also affect how children behave.  Unwary young viewers could be easily swayed by captivating advertisements  for junk food or video games, products whose target audience includes  children, and so may pester their parents to buy these goods impulsively.  In conclusion, although both factors have their own implications, I believe  the element with more considerable impacts on children is the content.  Hence, parental involvement is essential in controlling childrenâs TV viewing  habits and in shaping a childâs values to help them enter adult life with a  healthy mind.",

They can do some wrong activity due to the impact of this. Moreover, advertisements are more common nowadays on Television channels, they persuade juvenile towards  expensive things or gadgets, consequently, children irritate their parents to buy that kind of luxurious things. For instance, an article published by \"Hindustan Times\" showed that most broadcasters in India use advertisements to target juveniles to enhance their product sale.\n\nOn the other hand, these days there is a lot of time spent by children on TV, which has several demerits for their health as well as their productivity. Firstly, there are many kinds of UV rays that are released from the TV, which has detrimental effects on their eyesight and they have to use specs in their earlier days of childhood. Furthermore, when they watch screen they have to follow a sedentary lifestyle,  which can affect badly their posture and they have to face spinal problems. For example, a survey conducted by students of \"Mumbai University\" showed that most of the pupils in Mumbai are facing spinal issues and eyes related issues due to excessive use of TV. Secondly, children give their a lot of valuable time to television, which can be used in some useful activities such as studies, exercises and so on.\n\nTo conclude, although programs that are telecasted on TV are not good for children, In my opinion time is more important for them which they continuously waste on TV and gets many detrimental effects on their lives.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, TV popularity among young people have gone through boom period and it comes with severe consequences. Some obey that TV program has contributed to the children's role while others believe an action of kids are influenced by the amount of time in front of the TV. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the argument along with my own perspective.\nTo begin with, children, who taps into the world of television, have brought negative impacts on individual kids themselves. Besides, it leads to the misconduct of children if they watch inappropriate TV shows, such as crime movies, violent shows or offender documentary. As a result, young people started to imitate an act of violence and brings them towards a criminal road. Furthermore, kids will gently isolate from others and contributes to the lack of interaction with other people.\nSecondly, others believe spending too prolonged time watching TV will influence a child's manner. One reason is that, if the amount of time is not limited, students will become an introvert. Consequently, the negative effect is generated in a kidâs life. Being an introvert made children transformed into an aggressive person and hardly perform tasks on daily lives. This has resulted from the lack of adequate instruction since they become isolated from the outside world by spending most of their leisure time watching television.\nTo conclude, both actions generated by kid whether spending a large amount of time or improper TV program has brought them to negative behaviour on their own lives. Therefore, it contributes to the lack of social interaction and start to become an introvert. Furthermore, their own behaviour also affected by watching an aggressive movement of people that will bring them to a criminal path.",

    "essay": "Perhaps the idea of watching  TV causes childrenâs behaviour badly that has become a widespread one in recent decade,  with many individuals holding  different beliefs on it. Personaly i definitely  agree withe the above expressed statment , and there are many compelling reasons to support my view.\nIn the first place, i think television  is having a huge nigative impact  in Society. The fact that childrent link violence on televesion with crime rate in the real world. Children can easily copy the behaviour they see on the screen. Namely, nowadays many  youth TV programms are based mainly voilence, swearing, bullying, and horror films that youths are bacoming  an addvctive.  In addition,  not only affect behaviour but aslo children less health becouse they sepend their most of time in front of   TV screen  insteade of playing activity games. As a result, it is  leading to childernâs eyesight problems at their early ages.\nOn the other hand, advertisers  often aim their market at children that they can be easily influenced by adevertisments. For istance, when children see adverts of heroes  films or comyuter games that they put pressure to buy them that are waste of money and useless. Moreover, some TV programms  do not require much tought that same cartoons include only love stories not moral fary-tales. Whereas it is not suit for youth while they are learing moralities and kinds.\n\nIn conclusion, although both factors have their own imflications. I concur that parents should choose what they their children watch and\nAdvertising during children programs must be strictly controlled.",

    "essay": "Over the last two decades, the technology has improved tremendously. After the advent of television, the world we live has seen significant changes. However, there are some demerit as well with watching television. Some people think that the behaviour of the children changed due to some western shows and other think that children's behaviour changed because of most of the time spent on watching television. Following passage will discuss both the arguments, but in my viewpoint, both arguments are correct and it indirectly affects the children's attitude.\n\nFirstly, the television is one of the great technology where we receive updated information from every corner of the world in a fraction of seconds. People of all the ages watch the television at least 3 hours in a day. Due to this, television has become a good source of advertisement. Few ads are copied from the western countries and they are cast directly into the local channels. Television is watched with the family members and children under maturity age also watching these ads and getting influenced. \n\nSecondly, the television is grown as a vast from the last ten years and there are around thousands of channels to entertain us. For instance, cartoon channels for Children, game show channels for youngsters and serials for adults. Consequently, people are sticking to the television for hours. People are becoming inactive/lazy because the only physical activity required is to press one button. \n\nAfter having considered all the points that I have discussed above, we can draw to a conclusion that both the arguments have a significant effect on children's attitude.Parents and the government intervention required to overcome from these issues.",

    "essay": "In contemporary society, there are many things which leave significant impacts to children, particularly their behaviors. Due to this fact, some people consider that what the youngsters watch on TV will affect to them. Meanwhile, the others argue that the time they spend on watching TV will influence their behaviors a lot. In my opinion, I concur with the idea that children will be influenced by the content they watch on TV. \n\nOn the one hand, spending a big amount of time on television may result in the addiction of watching many hours. Because the young generations are in the process of development, they are curious about new things. Therefore, children find it interesting in watching TV for undiscovered things as well as their curiosity. \n\nHowever, this leads to the fact that eye diseases may be caused. If children focus on watching several hours, the strength of their eyes will be alleviated. Hence, children are likely to have illnesses such as myopic and hypermetropic. For instance, my younger brother had watched TV through days and nights. As a result, he is at level 5 of myopic at the moment. \n\nOn the other hand, the content on the TV will transmiss both benefits and drawbacks. Not only children can be educated by education channels, but also they can be harmed by pornography as well as violable words.Thus, every channels on the television should be controlled by the authorities with a view to ensuring the safety content.\n\nTo sum up, both of the ideas will have impacts on the childrenâs behaviours, but I nuture the opinion that what the youngsters watch will influence themselves.",

    "essay": "In recent times, several people have had conflicts about whether employers have to obey the dress principles in office or the productivity of work is their priority. I strongly believe that people should concentrate on the quality of their work completely instead of their dress, and this essay serves to elaborate on my opinion.\n\nA majority of people argue that the employers prioritize the quality of their work. When people pay all their attention on working, their production and performance in a company will be better and bring several benefits for both themselves and this company instead of spending time on resolving the problem related to fashion. Specifically, their company receives more reputation, hence employment's career and position may have a chance to be promoted. For instance, a prestigious company like Apple, there are not any requirements about the employment's dress, Apple's employments spend most time on design, fixing errors, and enhancing their products. These criterias made Apple become a famous and successful brand and community with several electronic devices existing anywhere.\n\nMoreover, the dress restrictions may expand the gap between employment in their working environment. Several companies force their workers to wear impolite clothes with many costume accessories, some staff want to show their wealth to the others by their fashion style and only interact with people who have brand clothes like them and avoid to work with people wearing simple clothes. Hence, after a long time these kind of working environment may become a fashion competition, instead people have to create ideas, products to promote and increase company's profit. Many companies has collapsed with a similar reason that the directors create complicated and unnecessary principles that lead to low quality of working environment, so many employees quit their jobs and these companies lose their customers.\n\nIn conclusion, i firmly believe that the bosses should not impose dressing rules to their staff based on the effect to the productivity and workplace.",

    "essay": "In this modern workplace, the trend of dress codes is changing as employers focus more on results than rules that employees must follow. Although I agree that people should dress formally in some professional settings, there is no one-size-fits-all answer for every industry.\n\nOn the one hand, professional attire plays a key role in certain professions, such as the hospitality industry, and healthcare sectors, to name but a few, which is considered a must for many jobs. For example, clients are able to recognize waiters or waitresses at a hotel by clothing, thus facilitating work procedures and saving time and effort. The uniform is also a norm among soldiers and police officers, which can not only make them easily identified but signalize the image of authority and trustworthiness. Furthermore, formal wear is usually required on some occasions to show our respect and professionalism to others. For instance, interviewees should put on office attire in the meeting, thereby impressing interviewers with professional attitudes. \n\nOn the other hand, the uniform may deprive us of creativity and the pursuit of freedom, which should not be de rigueur in all contexts. It is par for the course for employees working in high-tech companies to wear casually. After all, they do not need to serve customers face-to-face or present seriousness to others. More importantly, dress codes should not steal the show in the workplace, instead, they must place high emphasis on the work results. Furthermore, with the increasing number of people working at home and becoming self-employed, it is unnecessary to regulate subordinates what to wear at work. \n\nIn conclusion, while business clothes should not reign supreme in all businesses, it is still the order of the day in many professions according to professional settings and requirements.",

    "essay": "There is a controversial perspective heating up a debate over that it is not essential for employers to take how their employees dress into consideration since job productivity is the major final aim. I partially uphold this notion.\n\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, some people hold a strong view that wearing a uniform irrelevant to oneâs work performance and will not cause any negative impacts in the workplace. This can be true since what people are wearing does not contribute directly to most of things they do at work. For example, Facebook and Google are one of some large enterprises that do not restrict how people dress at work because their employees have to spend most of their time at a computer or a desk and what ever they wear, may it be formal, casual, or semi-casual, it does not change the level of proficiency. Thus, some companies may not be affected by how their employees dress.\n\nWhile the outfits of employees do not do harm to some firms, it may result in some undesirable problems regarding some certain jobs. Having a smart outlook can facilitate the overall assessment of a company by its customers, potentially leading to an increase in revenue and profit. For instance, as a receptionist, a career which relates directly to an enterpriseâs first impression so they must dress formally for customers and guests to put more trust in the company. Hence, a certain type of job like receptionist requires people to dress properly so it cannot worsen the companyâs productivity .\n\nIn conclusion, although oneâs clothing preference or dress code at work does not directly influence productivity, its relevance is worth considering depending on the nature of work.",

    "essay": "Nowadays people feel that the way employees dress to work does not really matter and that employers should focus more on the content of their work. I partly agree with this view, as I believe that the quality of work is as vital as the appearance of employees.\n\nOne of the reasons why the quality of workers is very important is that the success of businesses and firms depend on it. Qualities such as knowledge, skills and experience in any job ensures consumer satisfaction. When consumers are happy with the quality of services, they improve the ratings of the firm. For example, companies like Apple and Google employ the best graduates in various fields. This enables them to produce the best phones and softwares, hence, becoming market leaders.\n\nHowever, what people wear to their work places in any profession is also important. Dressing in official clothes makes a customer more comfortable with the service provider. For example, a medical doctor is expected to be in a white coat. Dressing inappropriately might make patients uncomfortable and withhold vital information. Dressing well also gives employees a sense of seriousness when going to work. If employees wear casual clothes like jeans and flip-flops to work, they might not take their jobs more seriously. This would probably be because, there would be no difference between home clothes and work clothes.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the qualities an employee provides for a firm is as significant as the way they appear in their workplaces.",

    "essay": "One school of thought holds that people should research their family roots as the best way to create a meaningful study, whereas others believe that concentrating on the present and later offspring is a better option. This essay attempts to shed light on both perspectives before concluding that I am in favour of the latter notion.\n\nOn the one hand, some individuals should study their ancestry origin due to a variety of factors. First, it must be affirmed that each person has his or her roots, a place called hometown, and a reason to be born, consequently, this exploration helps them to better understand their origin. It is really practical compared to the studies that are somewhat macroscopic and some of its contents that are vague and unverified. In addition, if parents deeply understand ancestry traditions, they will become an encyclopedia helping their offsprings understand their ancestor's origins. This knowledge, as a historical demonstration of each parentage, is summarized to help their descendants approach as quickly as possible. For instance, parents can help their sons and daughters understand their ancestor's history through brief stories every night before they are going to bed.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a host of compelling reasons why I am convinced that it is more beneficial to focus on succeeding generations. One reason is that children are the future of each parentage, the prosperity or survival of each family depends on their offspring. Therefore, parents need plans to orient their children to overcome upcoming difficulties and challenges. For example, the major Korean Cheabol Groups such as Samsung, LG, and Hyundai are very focused on training their children to become heirs to the family. Their descendants all go through an extremely harsh training and learning process to have forthcoming success, as Lee Jae-Yong - the current President of Samsung is a typical example. Another reason is that in the macro aspect, descendants are the factors that help their own country develop and compete with other countries, as a result, focusing on their education is more important than anything else.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is irrefutable that people could research their roots without any consideration for others, I would contend that it should be limited and focus on the next generations because of their indispensable influences on human's future.",

While each has its own perks, I would contend that it is optimal to combine both mentioned opinions.\n\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, doing research into a family background brings a wealth of benefits. However, the most common one is developing a deeper understanding of the hardship that our ancestors have been through in order to be grateful toward what they have sacrificed for. For instance, In Vietnam, every house has altars to worship their fathers by offering incense. It is a way to remind and pay respect to the origin. Therefore, a better understanding of the family history plays a paramount significance.\n\nOn the sharp contrary, others agree with a view that we should focus on the moment and future generations rather than the previous time. Obviously, family historical background can not apply to some aspects of life such as economy, schooling, to name a few. Instead of spending too much time looking back at the past, we should pay attention to the present and next age. For example, investing money in young people's education is a worthy way to develop not only their family but also the country. Hence, taking notice of the younger generations is of importance.\n\nTo sum up, besides doing research into the root of family, the present and following generation needs to be focused on too.",

While some hold a strong view that it is essential to know about the history of the family, others claim that we should take care of the present and future generations. From my perspective, I would contend that it is optimal to combine both mentioned factors.\n\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, it is extremely necessary to understand family history. You can have more knowledge in order to apply it to daily basics and by doing so it can help your life be much easier. For instance, if you are ill or catch a cold you can use some conventional method such as shaved wind to help you feel better. Hence, I believe that preserving and understanding family history is important with each person because we can help support the knowledge that our forefathers went through and pass down to us.\n\nWhile the importance of learning family trees is widely acknowledged, it is unfair if that focusing on present and later generations is ignored. Concentrating on the following generations brings a myriad of benefits especially to the workforce. For example, the USA is one of the most populous countries in the world with an abundant and highly technical manspowers so that their products are pretty decent.

By doing so, younger generations will have respect for the dedication of their ancestors, and show that respect day by day through major holidays. For example, families in Vietnam every New Year offer incense and make rice offerings to their ancestors to express gratitude for building up family culture and traditions. Hence, it is essential for the younger generation to learn about the history of their family. \n\nWhile the importance of doing research about the family tree is widely acknowledged, it is unfair if that of concentrating on the present and future is ignored. Apparently, the younger generation has a more developed and cutting-edge mindset. Based on that, they can refine family traditions into newer ones without losing their cultural value.

    "essay": "To have enough to share; to know the joy of giving; to thrill with all the sweets of life - is living. Helping others is a very virtuous thing. Charities help in basically two ways. One is by offering support to people in their own country, and the second is by helping the needy irrespective of their country. In this ,essay I intend to delve into the benefits of both approaches.\n\nThere are many advantages to charities helping their own countryâs people. Firstly, these organisations remain directly in touch with the needy. They can see how the money or other  other resources provided by them are being used. It has been well said that charity begins at home. What is more, domestic charities target problems specific to their home country, for instance Help Age India is an Indian charity providing help for the aged in India.\n\nThere are also many advantages if these organisations help the needy in any corner of the world. In such ,cases these organisations work on a larger platform and provide help for global issues. A larger platform is a must if one has a lot to offer in charity. Help activities can be better spread through a larger network. Help need not be always in the form of money. It can be in the form of services also. For example, these organisations can provide doctors and teachers who volunteer to provide medical aid and also teach in  underdeveloped nations.\n\nHelp in any form is good. The condition of oneâs country could influence the way of helping. In a developed country, where even the poorest of the poor have the basic amenities of life, it would be better to help in any part of the world where people need help. But, in the case of a developing or underdeveloped ,country it would be better to help those around you.\n\nTo put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that the purpose of charity organizations is to help people in need and it does not matter where this help goes. If people of the home country need help then it would certainly be advisable to help those around you first.",

    "essay": "Some people argue that donation firms must deliver their help to those in greatest need despite the nation borders, whereas some believe that it should be allocated to local citizens. This essay will explain both perspectives and examine why I side with allocating charity to people who need it the most. \n\nIn one hand, helping local resident could empower local donors to continuously spare their money on a charity as they can see direct impacts on their communities. For example, one area struggling with poor education system will get the opportunity to progress if there is enough money to increase facilities, such as adding a library and introducing some technologies at school. Allowing charity to take part in this issue will significantly help children to get a better education through newly introduced facilities. Conversely, if charities are distributed to foreign land, the local donors unable to see the immediate impacts, and it might discourage them as they could question the accountabilities of the charity bodies. \n\nOn the other hand, despite the possible advantage above, I would argue that charity should be allocated based on urgency level regardless of where they live. One of the most significant reasons is a humanitarian principle which means that people deserve to get help despite the nation borders. To illustrate, when Tsunami hit Japan, all countries collectively give aids to victims and survivors because they need hands with medical supplies, access to clean water, and clothing. In another words, they become vulnerable and sufficient helps could determine between life and death. Another reason for this is that international organization such as UNICEF will always target children worldwide, which means that they will focus on uplifting childrenâs lives no matter where they live. As a result, the type of each charity determines how the money will be distributed, and most international firms with sufficient donors will focus on giving aids to those in greatest need. \n\nIn conclusion, donations specifically directed to home countries are mostly due to empowering local donors and limited budgets. Conversely, charity must be given to people in greatest need because of humanitarian values and the type of charity body. I am remain fully convinced to side with the latest arguments.",

Some people, therefore, suggest that the price of fattening food should be increased. From my point of view, I totally agree with both statements.\n\nOverweight can lead to numerous serious diseases. The main reason why the number of people with obesity have been rising rapidly is consuming too much fast food. These days, especially in the urban area,  people tend to eat more junk food because of its convenience, affordable price and deliciousness. However, food such as hamburgers include a large amount of fattening and a lack of fiber and other nutrition. Consequently, this may lead to uncontrollable weight gain. In the long term, your the body will contract some health problems such as stroke, high blood pressure and heart attacks.\n\nTo solve the issue mentioned, food prices should be adjusted by the authorities. From my perspective, the price of fattening foods should be raised and the price of healthy food such as vegetables should be decreased by the government to reduce the number of overweight people. Therefore, residents may tend to prefer buying nutritional food rather than junk food and it may lower the overweight people. In the long term, the government can control the number of people who become obese. \n\nIn conclusion, more people are becominge remarkably obese due to fattening from fast food and lack of fiber.

To cite an example, if we do not read a newspaper we cannot know about the war between Russia and Ukraine.

Thus, that can make them feel less homesick when they are far away.\n\nTo sum up, reading the newspaper or watching televisions news programs do not waste peopleâs time, they make individuals gain more knowledge. I believe that aforementioned points are strongly supporting my view of points",

    "essay": "Nowadays, the public is being bombarded with a plethora of information from newspapers and television programs. It is often considered that news is a pointlessness that has nothing to do with their life. Personally, I completely disagree with this statement because the advantages of news, as well as newspapers,as well as newspapers bring countless benefits to people.\n\nAnalyzing the statement and explaining further, the first and foremost reason is that numerous people have their own businesses; they exactly need to deal with problems such as a fluctuating economy or inflation. As a result, they must catch up with the news every day. Furthermore, building a good personal habit of reading the news has tremendous benefits. For example, if people receive regular updates on current affairs, celebrity news, world events, etc., their range of knowledge will be expanded.\n\nThere is a stronger reason to argue that citizen possibly feels like approaching overseas. One example they often reference is the COVID-19 epidemic or the most recent earthquake in Turkey. Watching news programs helps you get a comprehensive overview of the problems and helps us realize what is happening on this earth, even to us. This means that watching essential reports  does not always waste time  if each individual uses this activity to seek valuable knowledge.\n\nIn conclusion, for the reasons I have mentioned above, I completely disagree with the statement that the news has no relationship with people. If people can carefully identify the right news for them, it should provide them with enormous benefits.",

    "essay": "It is believed by some that reading newspapers and watching news programs on television is a waste of time since news seems to be irrelevant to human daily lives. In my opinion, I totally disagree with this view as I strongly argue that news plays a vital role in peopleâs lives these days.\n\nFirst and foremost, I hold a firm belief that news is of vital importance in enhancing human beingsâ living standards. This is because by keeping updated with the latest information, people can broaden their knowledge in many life aspects. This can be exemplified by some news programs about tips to have a healthy lifestyle. By watching such programs or reading healthcare articles, modern people can be aware of their unhealthy lifestyle, then form the right attitude towards a healthier way of life and ultimately lead a better life to maintain good physical and mental health. \n\nBesides, it is undeniable that news provides useful information for humans to become more proactive in dealing with unexpected situations on a daily basis. On a smaller scale, news about weather forecasts, for instance, can allow people to be well-prepared with raincoats or umbrellas before going out in order not to get wet and sick afterwards. Furthermore, news can also be of vital importance in more serious cases like the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, thanks to the spreading power of news media, Vietnamese people can quickly have aware of the severity of the pandemic, so they take immediate actions to protect themselves and their family members from contagious risks by methods given on newspapers or TV news programs. As a result, Vietnam can fight against the COVID successfully and save many lives from death.\n\nIn conclusion, on account of the aforementioned reasons, I hold an argument that the role of news media in peopleâs daily lives is undoubtedly essential. It is highly recommended that people should utilize the news to make their life better and more connected to current affairs.",

    "essay": "With the advent of the information flash, more and more people are reading the daily news as a hobby. Paradoxically, some people see no connection between the news and people's lives, suggesting that reading the news can take a long time. This essay will explain why I totally disagree with this educational perspective.\nFor starters, the news offers a wealth of general knowledge in various areas. In particular, the phenomenon of watching news programs helps you to get a comprehensive overview of everyday problems. Not only can you take your own position when evaluating an opportunity, you also have more topics that you can discuss in everyday conversations with friends. For example, if you read a variety of news categories such as politics, business, and entertainment, your range of knowledge will expand. If you specialize in an area like medicine or science, medical and scientific news will increase your knowledge accumulation.\nFurthermore, building a good personal habit of reading news has tremendous benefits. In fact, most citizens are kept informed of the latest news in the scientific community. In this case, the community will necessarily benefit from this type of people. For example, people generally update themselves by reading a large number of modern topics so as not to become an outdated and decadent individual. In principle, however, newspapers and television programs generally make the headlines for reporting incidents. Although certain events are not relevant to people's lives, this fact adequately hinders the possibility of irregularities because society condemns them.\nIn summary, this article offers many advantages when reading or viewing news related to knowledge acquisition and social merit. I do not agree with this proposal at all to become a university citizen at all.",

    "prompt": "\"Some people believe that the best way to reduce traffic congestion in cities is to provide free public transportation. Others, however, think that other measures are needed. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\"",
    "essay": "Traffic congestion has become a ubiquitous challenge in urban areas, leading to increased commute times and environmental concerns. As urban populations continue to grow, the search for effective solutions intensifies. One school of thought asserts that providing free public transportation is the key to alleviating congestion, while an opposing viewpoint argues for alternative measures. In this essay, we will explore both perspectives, examining the advantages of free public transportation as well as the feasibility of alternative approaches. Ultimately, the goal is to weigh the merits of each stance and offer a comprehensive view on the most viable strategies to address the ever-growing issue of traffic congestion in our cities.\n\nSome proponents argue that providing free public transportation is the most effective solution to address traffic congestion. By removing the financial barrier to using public transport, more people are likely to choose it over private vehicles, thereby reducing the number of cars on the road. For instance, in Singapore, the implementation of free bus services during peak hours resulted in a significant decrease in traffic volume, offering a practical example of the positive impact of this approach.\n\nOn the other hand, skeptics believe that alternative measures are necessary to combat traffic congestion. Congestion pricing, for instance, has proven successful in major cities like London and Stockholm. By charging drivers for entering the city center during peak hours, congestion pricing not only discourages unnecessary trips but also generates revenue for improving public transportation infrastructure. This demonstrates that a multifaceted approach may be more effective than relying solely on free public transportation.\n\nIn my opinion, while free public transportation can be a valuable component of a comprehensive strategy, it should not be the sole focus. Combining initiatives such as congestion pricing, the development of cycling infrastructure, and the promotion of carpooling can create a more sustainable and adaptable solution. This balanced approach addresses the diverse needs of urban populations and offers a more realistic path toward reducing traffic congestion in our cities.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over how best to mitigate traffic congestion in urban areas is complex and multifaceted. While advocates of free public transportation emphasize its potential to reduce the number of private vehicles on the road, proponents of alternative measures, such as congestion pricing, highlight the need for a diversified approach. After considering both views, it is my contention that a balanced strategy, incorporating elements of free public transportation alongside other measures, presents a more realistic and sustainable solution. By embracing a comprehensive perspective, cities can not only enhance mobility for their residents but also contribute to the creation of more environmentally friendly and efficient urban environments. The path forward involves recognizing the intricacies of each approach and forging a synergistic strategy that addresses the unique challenges of individual urban landscapes.",

Providing help to art will attract more people and create many job opportunities.

On the flip side, the developing world, struggling with limited resources, may have no substitute but to priorities other areas such as infrastructure development and job creation instead.\n\nIn conclusion, while publicly funded access to healthcare and education can have many benefits, it may not be suitable for all countries.

Some believe that the government should take up the responsibility to help artists, while others consider it a waste of money. But considering human rights and education, I believe that the government should assist artists.\n\nFirstly, the government should offer assistance to all art creators because they are equal members of society. Specifically, even though the works of artists may not yield immediate profits, they are no different from regular individuals except for their professions. Therefore, when they face difficulties, they have the right to receive government-provided aid and should not be discriminated against due to their profession. Providing assistance to them is not a waste of money; it is merely supporting equal members of society.\n\nSecondly, the government has a responsibility to support art creators because the artworks they produce can enhance education. In other words, compared to ordinary mechanical work, creating art requires artists to observe the world around them and employ their imagination. Therefore, when children appreciate these works, it can stimulate their creativity and innovation while also fostering critical thinking. As a result, artists can play a role in education through their artworks.\n\nTherefore, from their status as citizens and their contributions to education, artists should be protected and assisted by the government. Hence, I believe that the government should extend a helping hand to artists in need, and this is not a waste of money.",

While others would argue that funding them is just a waste of money. Personally, I believe that artists share an imperative role in the country's culture and identity. Financing them will keep their spirit to continue to showcase local arts around the world, which lead to economic prosperity.\n\nSome proponents of arts urge the government to aid them in any form as they greatly contribute to our country's economy. Artists as we know them have brought prestige to our country even decades before, excelling in any forms of competitions and winning enormous cash prizes, such as in singing, and dancing; in addition to that the works of our local artist Juan Luna , which is internationally recognized that a piece of his artwork worth millions. Hence, the ability of resources for the artist would lead to  good products that can enhance the chance of being recognized. Therefore, many would after their services at any amount.\n\nOn the other hand, there are those on believe that providing money for arts is a waste, thinking of the insignificant value of their contributions. Arts may not be the best-paying job as many would not want to employ due to the less demand in business society and its slow counterproductivity. Unlike other professions, like Engineering, Science, and Medicine which are notably well-established in the business field  people will not hesitate to aid them financially. I believe that the illiteracy of some people to arts attributed to their ignorance prevents them from seeing the invaluable contribution of arts in the history of one's country.\n\nIn conclusion,  others may think that funding arts is just a waste of money.

    "essay": "Whether or not to allocate a budget to the development of art has always been a debated topic. While some support the need for sponsoring artists, others argue that the money is squandered and could be utilized for more meaningful causes. I agree that government should cease funding musicians, painters or poets and prioritize solving other important problems.\n\nOn the one hand, there are several struggles which citizens face in their daily life that need immediate attention from the authorities. Instead of spending huge amounts of funds in sponsoring artists who may not contribute to the progress of the country, it would be more beneficial if the money is spent on improving healthcare and educational facilities for the public. If the amount spent on building and maintaining art galleries ,for instance, was utilized in distributing affordable medicines, vaccines or improving sanitization in rural areas, rising cases of infections could be reduced drastically. Moreover, not every person is interested in music, paintings or poems. Thus, sponsoring artists should be a least be among the least priority allocations. \n\nOthers ,however, believe in encouraging art creators with sufficient funds. Art plays a major role in signifying the rich culture and heritage of any country. Historic museums and cultural festivals , for example, which have been providing a platform for artists to showcase their creations have always attracted tourists and art enthusiasts from different parts of the world for centuries. Funding talented musicians, painters or poets will not only bring economic growth in the form of tourism and entertainment but could also be influential in attracting the younger generation into the field of art.

I believe that the government should value the artists and their efforts by supporting them mentally and financially.\n\nSome people believe that the artists must be supported as they can give a characteristic to a society. A poem can show the history and the culture of a community, A painting and the other types of visual art like photographs can attract more tourists and expand the tourism industry. A lot of countries can find a reputation only by a piece of art. Louvre musuem, as an instance, attract millions of tourists which can be a great aid to support the tourism industry. Not all the people care about art and plargarism and lack of copy right are common crimes in different societies which can truly hurt each artist mentally and financially. It is the governments' responsibility to control and prevent these crimes  from happening and  provide a thorough support for all artists.\n\nSome people do not consider art as an essential element in society and believe that public money should be spent on other activities such as scientific researches rather than art.

Whereas some people think that tax-payers money should not be spent on artists, others, including me, believe that a sort of government aid is better offered for artists.\n\nOn the one hand, those who believe that financial aid should never be given to support arts, defend their standpoint by arguing that, government focus should be on the more pressing matters. Health care and education are usually brought up as examples of sectors that could benefit from more governmental spending. In addition, the opposers argue that more spending on artists means one of two things; either more taxes, which puts a huge strain on the economy or less spending on the previously mentioned sectors, which, of course, is undesirable.  \n\nOn the other hand, as many would agree, art plays a vital role in developing personalities; It can also be used to promote good values; like sympathy and coexistence. Not subsidizing any money for the art and artists might negatively affect society. The reason for this is that artistic careers like painting and creative writing are usually not as financially rewarding as other careers. That being said, if we do not help aspiring art creators, they might not be able to make a living and provide for themselves and their families. As a result, they might quit art altogether in order to look for higher-paying jobs.\n\nTo conclude, by looking at both sides of the argument, I can say that, although those who oppose having any money spent on arts in fear of it leading to affecting other sectors hold a valid point, I believe that providing  reasonable financial support for those who are starting a career in arts would be beneficial to the society and is worth it.",

While a group of supporter asking government to encourage special skilled person by providing them several benefits, another group is opposing the same thing and stating that it is worthless to spend money on it. This debate is a hot potato these days in the market. \n\nIf we look at one side, the crowd of people who are against in dividing financial substitute, they might be arguing that provided fund should be allocated to the top most necessary things to mankind such as medical, food, and water crises. In the developing and poor country people are facing issues such as water pollution, hunger, low medical facilities. To come up from this issue it requires more investment in these areas. For example, in India, at the rural area, people are still facing problem of clean water. The government should focus on basic things first and should increase necessary structure. For instance, water purification plant. \n\nHowever, at the another side, the different arts such as painting helps people to enhance their creativity in their personal life.

Firstly, star are also  human beings, they have the right to live the lives that they want. Everyone has some personal problems  that they do not want to publicize in public. When the publishing publicises celebrities' private issues it would impact local people. For example, in the contemporary era,  young stars are following the trend by watching social publishing. Younger people are influenced by celebrities but they did not know about real life.  Celebrities  also earn money to influence more people. Therefore, superstars live differently in the real and reel world. \n\nFurthermore, nowadays, competition exists in all fields such as the news industry. Hence, the increased number of broadcasting that competition between media would rise. So, the news try to engage their audience to show these types of heroes and their personal life.

While many individuals suppose that these individuals should accept that due to their considerable fame, I hold the opposite viewpoint.\n\nIt is undeniable that some individuals who work as celebrities, such as actors, models, etc., suffer from the pressure of society on their professional and personal lifestyles. The media enterprises do this to obtain more notoriety and ratings for their prestigious companies. Therefore, they frequently invade their privacy by highlighting terrible circumstances in front of the public, which is considered a disgraceful act. For example, Nguyen Thuc Thuy Tien, Miss Grand International 2021, was sued by another woman about the non-payment of a debt. This will have a detrimental impact on her reputation and credibility.\n\nMoreover, I believe that each resident has their own privacy because every person is a separate individual. Thus, the unduplicated individual has the right to live and do everything they enjoy without breaking the law. Not to mention their significant contributions to the development of society as a whole as well as international contributions, especially in the entertainment industry.

While people argue that the government should play a main role in this, others think that such decisions are an individual responsibility. In my opinion, while the government should provide guidance and support, individuals must control their own lifestyle choices by self.\n\nLook at the first opinion on this question, who advocate for government intervention argue that public health initiatives can have benefits in the future. The government can create an environment conducive to healthier living. For instance, increasing taxes on unhealthy products like sugary drinks and fast food reduces the number of conditions such as obesity and diabetes. Also, public health campaigns and subsidized gym memberships can promote healthier habits, leading to improvements in the well-being of the population.\n\nOn the other hand, there is an opinion that a healthy lifestyle is an individual responsibility. Decisions about one's lifestyle should rest with the individual, as personal choice fosters a sense of ownership and empowerment. Also, individuals have diverse  preferences, and a universal approach may not be suitable for everyone. For example, some individuals may find traditional gym workouts boring and choose alternative forms of exercise like yoga or martial arts. As a result, individuals make their own choices and a more personalized approach to health can be better.\n\nIn conclusion, while the government should play a role in promoting healthy lifestyles, I believe that individuals should have the freedom to decide their own choices.

    "essay": "Given the ongoing poverty in underdeveloped countries, a multitude of individuals maintain that the most optimal solution is to provide children with  a 6-year education free of charge to eradicate illiteracy and improve numeracy. I find myself largely in agreement with this proposition as free education can equip them with foundational skills and liberate their mindset; however, it is essential to incorporate other solutions to form a comprehensive plan.\n\nThe foremost rationale for my endorsement of free-of-charge early education as the best solution is that it provides all children in developing countries, regardless of their family background, fundamental academic skills which include the ability to read, write and perform basic maths. These foundational skills would form a concrete basis for these children to thrive in the pursuit of knowledge, acquiring desirable degrees which vastly increase the chances of paid employment and a stable income in the future.\n\nThe second argument for why I support prioritising sponsoring tuition fees being the key to addressing poverty is the fact that school lessons allow children to escape from orthodox traditions. In the mountainous regions of Vietnam, these outdated traditions encompass early marriage, child labour and heavy drinking which are the underlying causes of underdevelopment. If all children were sent to free schools, they would be taught a more modern mindset, which celebrates liberation and personal growth, becoming independent individuals who can find their own way out of impoverishment.\n\nNevertheless, I acknowledge the importance of other approaches in an effort to support impoverished people. For instance, financial organisations should provide funding for upgrading infrastructure with better-connected roads and bridges. These would not only foster economic growth but also cultural exchanges that enable sustainable development.\n\nIn conclusion, I mostly agree with the idea of offering 6 years of schooling free of charge with a view to ending poverty in developing nations as it makes it possible for young people to acquire basic knowledge and have a more liberal mindset even though additional initiatives such as infrastructure improvement should also be in place. That is why governments should develop a comprehensive plan to address the issue of poverty systematically.",

    "essay": "A tuition-free pedagogy for six years is believed to be the most effective solution to combat impoverishment, equipping individuals with basic knowledge of numbers and words. Still, I totally disagree with this statement.\n\nFirst and foremost, free courses for a gap of 72 months could negatively impact social well-being. Particularly, not many educational institutions may afford to maintain free-of-charge teaching in the long-term due to the incurred problems of facilities upgrade and lecturers monthly salary. In other words, the tuition fee collected from students is used to pay for some necessities to ensure the operation of school; thus, in some cases of deficit budget, schools might use the government's mortgage, whose money should be spent for public improvements, to support their pedagogical schemes. Consequently, less national funds for communitiesâs services means less transformation for the society, acting as an abridgment for foreign investments to flow in the economy. Over the long period, famine will be more acute when there is limited monetary for social welfare. \n\nSecondly, there is no warrant that this approach can mitigate illiteracy. For certain reasons, if it is education free, the lesson designed for unprivileged students rarely covers all parts of the learning section.  What it means is that it only mentions the fundamentals, but it is not enough for a person to prepare for the drastic changes in our society nowadays. Looking back to last decades, the world has gone through numerous transformations, requiring people to be wise and resourceful to adapt. Hence, in order to overcome poverty, more elements should be considered, which are infrequently taught within free learning. Therefore, the aforementioned measures of dealing with illiteracy rate could be guaranteed in the short-term. \n\nIn conclusion, I firmly reckon that providing at no cost instruction has limited the overall lessening of poor and lack of skills because of the concerns about social status and teaching quality.",

    "prompt": "The best way to keep road transport safe is to make vehicle drivers have a driving test each year. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
    "essay": "There is a controversial idea debating whether the most efficacious method for ensuring safety in vehicular transportation on roadways is to institute an annual mandatory competency evaluation for drivers. Despite this may sounds to be appealing, I can hardly have any agreement on this idea.\n\nIt is undeniable that the main reason why the road transport has such a bad reputation is because of the unconsciousness and carelessness of the pedestrians instead of the cars themselves. Obviously, having yearly driving tests contributes to the drivers' sense of familiarity with traffic rules, which contributes to reducing driver-caused traffic accidents and broadening their horizon by refreshing and introducing the latest regulations in these tests. However, the uncontrollable and unpredictable behaviour of those pedestrians may affect the actual efficiency of such tests, considering in some areas the ignorance of traffic and the breakage of the regulations of the road users are becoming common sense.  As a result, a variety of situations are unable to be foreseen by exams and notwithstanding by it as well. \n\nMoreover, aside from the features that have been widely acknowledged, there are lots of other reasons that lead to unsafe road transport. In particular, bad car conditions significantly worsen road safety, cars in poor condition could be an obvious threat to anyone else on the road since their control quality is poor and usually behaves unpredictably, and neither their active nor their passive protection methods are lacking, leading to a significant reduction of surviving possibility when involving an accident. Likewise, those vehicles are unreliable and sometimes break down on the road, worsening the traffic and making accidents easier to occur. Therefore, other factors may also contribute to the lack of safety while driving on the street.\n\nIn conclusion, although taking tests for drivers may have some positive impact on the reduction of accident rate, there are many other factors that are unable to be ignored",

    "essay": "In this cutting-edge era, TV becomes part of our life. Most masses believe children habits are spoiled by watching television. Others think in the favour of this, as they grow up. This essay intends to discuss  both views and I will discuss my opinion in the forthcoming paragraphs.\n\nThe reasons why people believe watching tv has benefits on children. Firstly, children have a hectic schedule, they spend the most time in  school and later they have to do homework which had given by their teachers then spend some time on tv by watching their favourite show gives them relaxation from the study. Secondly, many education programs telecast on the tv and watching the right kind of shows increase knowledge. Finally, some children decide their career by watching sports, food, music, and arts from the tv program. For instance, most sportspeople choose sports by watching their favourite games. Therefore, Virat Kohli is one of them and he is the greatest cricketer in  history.\n\nOther individuals have a negative point on this. They say that children become lazy and couch potatoes by spending the most time in front of the television and the ratio of the obesity problem in the children are increasing every year, in spite of this their eyesight become weak. Further, many violent and vulgar shows are broadcast on tv, which affects them mentally due to this they develop some bad habits at an early age, later this becomes a great problem in their life.\n\nI believe that watching tv has an advantage for  toddlers. They learn many things from this such as cooking, art skills, sports, and some dance moves. Whereas, it is one of the greatest things to kill boredom in life.\n\nTo conclude, \"every coin has two sides.\" Parents should limit the time of watching television and watch tv with them so that they could not watch some aggressive shows.",

In my opinion, I disagree, because to solve this problem people need a total change our eating habits and exercise regularly.\n\nThe solutions for this problem need a total change in all of our eating habits. We should revise the contents of all of our daily foods and ensure that it provides us with all the basic nutrients and all of our heath-requirements for example, fruits, vegetables, milk, fish, meat. \n\n Moreover, we should add the exercise to our daily routine, as the doctor recommend that we should practice walking daily for a minimum of 10 minutes. Also, we should implement this concept in our new generation to raise a good healthy family. The governments should  have a great role on this by organising a campaign that would advertise for a healthy lifestyle and offer places for free walking and a sports centre at a low cost.\n\nIn conclusion, obesity would always be a common heath issue unless we change our lifestyle in terms of healthy and balanced diet and good physical exercise.",

    "essay": "In the modern medicine, obesity is a major risk factor for many chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiac arrest, liver dysfunction, and kidney disease. Unfortunately, people are becoming overweight increasingly. Sugar craving and eating junk food are some of the probable causes of this situation. Health organizations have advertised against these false habits for a long time, but until now, their attempts have been unsuccessful. Some experts, believe that government could restrain this problem by reevaluating food prices based on their nutritional value. The more beneficial foods get lower price tags in compare to fattening ones. In this way, financial value will be add to their health benefits.\n\nFast foods are places where you can find chip, quick, tasty and pretty unhealthy meal options. Fast food chains are increasingly growing all around the world and altering various food cultures in an unhealthy way. Their impact on society are far reaching and require urgent attention. Convincing the owners of such restaurants to raise up their prices is a sensible solution. In this way, these kind of foods will become less appealing while the restaurant owners wouldnât face financial crisis.\n\nOn the other hand, many experts believe that food pricing is an extremely sensitive area and a simple mistake could lead to dangerous conditions, because food is a primary human need and poor people could face huge problems by any inflation in the food market. Moreover, governmental interruption, could intimidate free economy and freedom of peopleâs choices.\n\nIn conclusion, while increasing the prices of junk foods offers potential benefits in order to popularizing high-nutritional foods, it also presents significant challenges in terms of restraining freedom of choices.",

    "essay": "In the current trend, it has become immensely visible seeing individuals experiencing obesity, and this has posed a general concern to most experts. In the early years, it has been mentioned to escalate the retail prices of coeval commodities that cause such medical scares. In the following paragraphs, I will be discussing why such a motion is unequivocal to alleviate the cause of the issue.\n\nPrimarily, exceeding the normal weight of an individual cannot be solely blamed on  food intake. An increment in such commodities' costing will not set them back and lead them  to decrease their body weights. There are other  products, at times considered organic, but still contribute to adding up numbers in the scale, remember, anything that is abusively consumed is still hazardous. \n\nMoreover, we should also not forget genetic factors. As it may be evident, people who suffer from stoutness, regardless of eating fibrous and calculated meals, with a tremendous amount of physical activity  still grow big. And this is because of their family genes,  and with this factor, all they can do is maintain a well-balanced diet and perform activities suitable to their weight and height.\n\nIn conclusion, heightening the selling price of ingredients that aid  a person's weight gain is not seen as an effective method to reduce such a healthcare crisis. Instead, supplementary components should also be taken into account parallel to lifestyle, food intake, and family lineage. Nevertheless, we should look at the person's desire to be the better version of himself.",

    "essay": "Obesity has become a serious health concern in many countries. While many people believe that increase in the price of fatty foods can help to tackle this problem, I believe, that other ways such as subsidising healthy food options can also be employed. In my opinion, a combination of these two is the best way forward.\n\nIt is true that the rise in the cost of junk food can help to reduce the problem of overweight. For instance, the sugar tax imposed in UK did have some positive benefits. However, companies reacted to this by reducing the sugar content just below the taxed slab which made more and more people buy this slightiest healthier version, without actually serving the purpose. In addition, this practise may look more of a punishment for those who are financially limited and cannot move to higher priced goods. \n\nInstead of inflating prices, reducing the prices of healthy foods can be more attractive choice in handling the concern of obesity. Also, it does not serve as a penalty and can complement the rise in calorie foods. Furthermore, when the nutritious dietary options are available at reduced price, people will definitely take advantage and will improve their overall health. For instance, the rate of fruits and vegetables can be provided at subsidised rates to encourage good eating habits.\n\nTo conclude, I agree that charging higher prices for oily food can help to check the increasing weight in people but only if it is complemented with the similar decrease in price of healthier versions of food items.",

    "essay": "Obesity has become a protracted conundrum globally. Certain individuals believe that raising the cost of fast food is the solution. This essay totally disagrees with this view because depriving people of fats can lead to other dangerous illnesses. Furthermore, sometimes, obesity is the product of lifestyle, unrelated to fatty products.\n\nFirst and foremost, while raising the prices of takeaways, for example, could lead to reduced consumption, not everyone will fail to access these, and people deprived of fat can develop other conditions, such as mental illnesses. For instance, several studies in Africa find that the shortage of Omega 12 and Vitamin B minerals, which can be obtained from certain fats from takeaways, is the leading cause of depression in the continent.\n\nSecondly, it is imprudent to imagine that obesity is only related to fastfood like fried chips and chicken. It could also result from poor lifestyle choices or realities, such as the lack of exercise and living with chronic stress. For example, it was reported in several media platforms, during the Covid-19 pandemic, that social distancing measures, preventing individuals from their routine exercises, caused them to gain weight. Such media outlets encouraged people to engage in indoor workouts to improve their health.\n\nIn conclusion, therefore, this essay completely refutes the notion that increasing the prices of weight-causing foodstuffs is the best solution for obesity. While it prevents consumers from purchasing the foodstuffs, it also deprives them from accessing important nutrients, which causes distress to their health. Likewise, increasing weight can also be the product of poor lifestyles, which must be addressed to improve overall well-being.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, there is a significant upward trend of people overweight. Some sectors of society are in favour of increasing the price of the most caloric food to prevent people from this major problem. In my opinion, I strongly disagree with this idea as the price will not stop from people buying these kinds of comestible. Subsequently, I consider that people need to be better educated in having healthier habits.\n\nTo begin with, increasing the price of fatty food will not stop people from consuming them. For example, statistics show that the main reason for obesity is anxiety and depression. People that are sad and depressed feel that they really need to eat this kind of food, in which case price will not be precisely a barrier for them as they would pay any amount of money in order to get it to satisfy this negative emotion they feel.\n\nOn the other hand, increasing the price of selected products would be unfair to people who are not obese and that want to enjoy their meals with something fatty. In this case, this would be discriminatory for these people, while the overweight problem would still exist. In other words, increasing the price will not prevent people from obesity as the problem is deeper than just paying a bit more but also will impact negatively on people's pockets who only want to enjoy these comestibles.\n\nIn conclusion, we cannot deny that this tendency of people to increase considerably their weight is a critical problem for societies. However, I completely disagree with the âpossibleâ solution of putting higher prices on fattening foods. Instead of this, I consider that governments should attend to this problem for real through educative chats and programs in schools and other institutions.",

This essay will discuss both sides and draw my conclusion.\n\nFirstly, it is undeniable that newspapers are very common in humanâs daily life. This is because the press has emerged for a long time and reading newspapers has become a daily habit of the public, especially  seniors. Moreover, newspapers have a wide range of information such as topics related to politics, news about daily life or advertisements. In other words, with only one piece of newspaper, people can obtain reports about every event which is happening around them. Furthermore, reading newspapers is the choice of many people  because of their reliability. Basically, the press operates under a certain code of conduct which regulates the quality and trustworthiness of facts. Therefore, it is required that all news must be checked carefully and verified before publishing. \n\nOn the other hand, with the development of new technology and the booming of the internet, there is an increase in the popularity of other media platforms for instance online press or Facebook. The main reason for this trend is that these new platforms play a role as  info storage and can quickly and easily deliver any type of news to readers with just a few simple clicks. For example, with an internet connection and using smartphones, Vietnamese people not only can get exact information about the election of the American President but also can watch the whole election process broadcasted lively.\n\nIn conclusion, although both newspapers and other media platforms are crucial in human daily life, I believe that the new platforms will take over the traditional press soon due to their availability of information and accessibility.",

Meanwhile, online journals uploaded on the internet are supported by many people. From my point of view, the benefits of approaching new reports on electronic devices surpass those of printed news.\n\nOn the one hand, the journals which are produced on papers every day or every week such as a magazine are suitable for certain people, especially the elderly. For instance, it is a troublesome challenge for senior citizens to control such modern gadgets for reading the articles because they are not as mercurial as the younger ones. In addition, oldster is familiar with following daily on papers and also places their confidence in the accuracy level of its material for a long time, therefore, they arenât willing to change their habits.

For example, people can approach to all the ongoing around the world wherever they go only with their available equipment such as mobile phones or laptops. Moreover, the information on the internet is updated continuously every time.

There are both merits and demerits to this situation. If asked, the demerits are surpasses the merits. My inclination is discussed in the ensuing paragraphs. \n\nDiscussing the disadvantages of peer pressure, the foremost one is that many young people face stress and strain, because they compare their abilities with others. Therefore, they feel sad and it leads to an increase in their anxiety level. For instance, if someone not received the same award as others for their profession or study it makes them feel lower than others. Furthermore, it may create jealousy among their friends or relatives.

Personally, I believe that an employee's appearance is just as vital as the quality of their work.\n\nWhen employees have good work quality, this will inevitably lead to the growth of future companies. Therefore, the growth of the company completely depends on the quality of the employees' skills such as technical skills, communication skills, problem-solving skills, etc.  Employees with good skills will make customers satisfied, thereby helping to build customer trust and loyalty to the company. In Vietnam, for example, Schannel company is an innovative company. Schannel often recruits dynamic, young, creative employees. This allows them to easily bring new and attractive ideas to the market. And it also helps Schannel get a huge amount of views on many platforms like TikTok, Youtube,... So, the quality of the employees' work is a solid premise for the company to develop well.\n\nHowever, there are many industries that require employees to wear uniforms so that customers can easily identify and show respect. From there it also builds trust between customers and service providers. To illustrate, doctors must wear white blouses. If they were wearing casual clothes, the patient would not know they were a doctor. Besides, dressing well and politely will help employees be more confident and serious about their work.

    "essay": "Nowadays, newspapers have brought significant change to our lives. However, whether presses have a positively impacted on the people's conscious about the things happen in the world or not is a controversial issue. I am of the opinion that this would do more pros than cons.\nThere are several benefits associated with the way that magazines influence on publicâs opinion. First of all, it is obvious that media disclose social problem, monitor and push the government to deal with them. This means that a 24-hour, non-stop international news cycles will make people pay attention to the heated issue and thereby cause pressure to government to tackle it immediately. Moreover, newspapers also provide all kinds of information, ranging from current affairs to entertainment news. For example, there are thousands of news are posted every day and thus, they will enable them to keep pace with all latest events in the world. So, media will contribute to help readers raise their aware of social.\nThis is not to say, however, that presses would not have a cons impact. There are, of course, sometimes presses will report negative stories, view and mood distorted ad incorrect information to readers. Although the major function of newspapers is to cater for audiences, they often make people are flooded with false news to give citizens the impression that things are getting worse. Consequently, presses can make money from readers who felt scare about this coverage. But, the things that newspapers bring to people are still more important.\nIn conclusion, In conclusion, media have a positive role in the way the reader access to the news.

    "essay": "In this fast-paced era, youngsters follow their surrounding people, who are in the same age group and then change their behaviours and attitudes. This is known as \"peer pressure\". There are both merits and demerits to this situation. If asked, the demerits are surpasses the merits. My inclination is discussed in the ensuing paragraphs. \n\nDiscussing the disadvantages of peer pressure, the foremost one is that many young people face stress and strain, because they compare their abilities with others. Therefore, they feel sad and it leads to an increase in their anxiety level. For instance, if someone not received the same award as others for their profession or study it makes them feel lower than others. Furthermore, it may create jealousy among their friends or relatives. As a result, they do not respect  others' skills or knowledge. \n\nMoreover, young group people are not given importance to their  skills or talent, but they run behind others' achievements and careers. Consequently, they become competitors and fight like warriors. Sometimes also they do something wrong to others and consume some toxic substance. For example, many college students consume drugs because of education pressure and family pressure. Parents always compare their children with their peers, and give force them to do better than others. \n\nOn the contrary, there are some pros too. To initiate with, peer pressure makes them better and gives them more confidence to develop their art. they may learn many things from their peers like sports activities, educational skills and other skills.\n\nTo conclude, there are a few benefits such as enhancing their expertise and motivation from others, but there are many drawbacks stress and strain and jealousy too. However, my arguments prove that the disadvantages of this situation are more than the advantages.",

    "essay": "In recent years, there have been celebrities complained about their life privacy became publicized by media publicize. As such there are agreement and disagreement to this situation, although I opine that its disagreements outweigh the agreements. In my opinion, I agree for some extents, because celebrities have their lives outside being an idols. In this essay, I will examine all the relevant arguments based on factual premises.\n\nNowadays, the media puclicize has been tried their best to find numerous information about the celebrities, because it is their occupation. The celebrity choose this profession, and they must know about the consequences from this line of work. For example, a KPop Idol who have fame, all of their fans want to know the details activities that they have due to this the media will look this as a new opportunity to gain money. \n\nHowever, on the other hand, celebrities have their right to choose what kind of matters that they want to publish. Moreover, some media sometimes choose the controversial information about the celebrity just to obtain followers in social media. It can be harmful to the celebrity future. For instance, a reporter capture an inappropriate photo and post it in the social media before asking for the approval, and it can be disastered for idol career. \n\nIn conclusion, even though, they are a celebrity, they have their right to choose everything especially that have correlation with themselves.

    "essay": "I disagree with the view that celebrities have to accept the manner in which their private lives are made  public by the media. lt is undeniable that they are in the spotlight and want to be popular by choice.  However, their rights to privacy need to be protected as well, as they too are humans. I shall put forth my  arguments in this essay.  To commence with, celebrities are already under a lot of pressure to perform well, as they are public  figures and are always in the public eye. Be it a politician, a sportsperson, a singer or an actor, all these  professions require them to be at their best at all times. This stress of someone constantly following them  affects the way they perform, which ultimately leads to a loss for the masses.  Secondly, these celebs are role models for the people. When any negative side of their private life is  exposed, their followers think it glamorous to do the same, which is definitely detrimental for the society  as a whole. For example, if people come to know that the celeb they adore, smokes and drinks in private  life, they think there is nothing wrong in doing so and also copy their idol. This is where responsible  journalism is needed.  Undoubtedly, the celebrities choose this life for the name and fame and to be ln the spotlight. Without the  media, the term celebrity will not hold any meaning. However, that doesn't mean that the media and  paparazzi have a right to stalk them at all times. To add to it, sensationalizing the news in order for the  channel to get more TRP is unethical. Responsible journalism and some ethics need to be followed by those  who get the news to the masses, as they may adversely affect someone's personal and professional lives.  Who doesn't remember the unfortunate incident when the world lost a very eminent public figure, Lady  Diana? That accident happened because the paparazzi were chasing the car she was travelling in. lt is  something which could have been easily avoided, had the paparazzi been a little rational in their behavior.  To sum up, it can be reiterated that responsible journalism means knowing its limits. Celebs too have their  private lives and they have a right to privacy. The media has to be judicious in knowing what to report and  how much to report, and should never misuse its power.",

    "essay": "Celebrities are known and popular figure in society and it is seen on many occasions that media disclosed their private life to attract the viewers. However, I believe celebrity chooses name and fame and always want to be in limelight, but every individual has the right to protect his or her personal life.\nTo begin with, indeed, itâs true that the key aim of bigwig is to attract the attention of the public and be the centre of discussion. Popularity is directly linked to their monetary benefit and it decides their impact on society or country. It is observed in many instances that big guns are engaged in doing abnormal activities like posting sultry images on social media, making derogatory remarks against political leaders and revealing ill stuff from their wardrobe and they put all these efforts just to be in public eye. Media houses are also given priority to such flaming news and they keep on showing to their viewers as a headline which in turn increase their rating and add more revenue to their business.\nHowever, every human wants to put a barrier in their special life and no one wants to make it public. Many celebrities are well known because their jobs put them in the spotlight like singer, actor, actress, sportsmen and many more. They should be allowed to relax, sit and enjoy with their loving ones. Being followed by paparazzi can be sometimes scary or deadly if heavy weight gets chased in their car. Take an example of Lady Diana, there was a speculation about her death that she died because she was stalked by media personnel and in the process of running away from them, her car met fatal accident.\n\nTo conclude, every entity wants some sort of personal space and it shall be respected.

    "prompt": "Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodworking should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family.To that extent do you agree or disagree?",
    "essay": "There is a debate over whether textbook-based education should be emphasized or whether schools should be attentive to some life skills such as cookery, dressmaking, and woodworking. I partly agree with this view and I will enumerate my reasons below.\n\nTo begin with, there are a few reasons why academic tendency is most important. For one thing, this is the essence of education which is the proven curriculum that are designed with the goal of fostering talent students. Furthermore, examinations are good way to verify educational achievement. Normally, Math, Science, and Literature, which contain essential knowledge, can be taught by the teachers who have professional qualifications. Therefore, it is hard to learn this academic knowledge outside of schools.\n\nIn spite of the reason mentioned above, I am of the opinion that there are another crucial factors, such as cooking, sewing, and woodworking, in school education besides academic success. One of the major reasons for this contention is that the parentsâ prowess and ability are different since they have a variety of occupations. For this reason, there could be the gap between students about learning those life skills. For example, some students cannot learn woodworking as their parents cannot. Another reason commonly put forward is that not every student has aptitude for academic success. Thus, students who have various talent can be discovered, equipping them with a range of essential life skills. This can be attained by regualr and systematically practices in schools.\n\nIn a nutshell, although there are some reasons why studying should be impacably prioritize, learning other indispensable life skills also should be involved in the regular curriculum.",

    "essay": "In this period of technology, many people argue that social skills like cooking, sawing, and so on should be taught by family or learned from friends. Nonetheless, I quibble from them and propound that these sorts of skills should be taught in academic environments like schools, and this essay will further throw light upon in my upcoming paragraphs, after which I will draw a suitable conclusion.\n\nSupporting my disagreement with the given statement, I firmly believe that students should go to school day by day in order to learn about how to do math or read a long poem in a book. However,Â  people always forget that students also need social skills such as cookery or dressmaking. We should let students and encourange them put their knowledge into practice. Another prominent take into account is that when students have social skills, they will gain more confidence and prepare for their future. Moreover, when students were taught in schools by teachers who majoring in those areas, they could know how to deal with work problems. For instance, teachers can point out the mistakes and lend a hand with their studentsâ work, and so on.\n\nExplaining some of the other supporting points against this statement, it is true that in recent years, not all the students have been interested in doing homework or getting involved with books. They tend to do what they like, so once again, schools should also educate social skills to adopt studentsâ hobbies in addition to teaching them how to calculate numbers. In light of the fact that when they could be taught in an academic environment, they also learned about awareness and morality rather than from their family or friends. As a consequence, learning social skills can bring benefits to society and the world. Annually, there are millions of clothes and cakes provided to consumers. Although, with the advancement of technology nowadays, robots can replace them in factories,Â  we cannot deny that cakes made by humans are much more delicious than those made by robots. The same is true of other stuff around the world.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the aforementioned points above strongly support my view.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, thousands of institutes teaching different skills to their  students and they are very hopeful for a better future also parents should train their children to learn different work.\n\nFirstly, I strongly agree with the notion, schools should pay attention to academics and prepare their  students to perform well in examinations and get good grades. for instance, there are a lot of institutes which are giving training in different fields of life such as, cookery, woodwork and many others skills which can help them to succeed in their lives. However, nowadays parents are also working for their children day and night for their better career they don't have enough time to give lesson children on different life skills which are useful for them.\n\nFurthermore, all things considered, friends are also stuck in their daily routines they don't have much time to give lessons on useful skills. In addition, governments  should focus on these types of schools which are teaching different art of life and also spend a huge amount, it should be free of cost governments bear all expenses. In other words, globally authorities spend big amount this kind of schools because they make sensible citizens who work hard for their country.\n\nIt is  impossible for schools to concentrate on both fields because they are different if they try to work on dual challenges might be difficult to perform well so  schools should restrict  their syllabus. \n\nI conclude with, institutes are trying to make money more money than their rivals so they make effort to continue with many challenges at the same time.however, it could be harmful.

Although technological advancement can aid in accomplishing tasks that humans cannot do, I think that it will give rise to theunemployment.\n\nOn the one hand, machines have the ability to go beyond the radar of where humans can reach. This comprises some challenging sectors like mining or working in countries with harsh weather conditions. Furthermore, the usage of machines can mitigate any kind of the risks involved with the human body. Moreover, artificial intelligence can help to detect information at a high pace compared to the human brain. For example, many low-wage workers from Nepal who work in the Middle East countries lose their lives due to extreme weather or falling off from a height. Hence, to  safeguard the lives of people, robots can be an alternative.\n\nOn the other hand, robots, if offered as an alternative, will take away the jobs of the public. Due to extensive technological upgrades, not only the white-collar employees, but all kinds of workers fear losing their income. For example, Naulo, a Nepali restaurant, has robotic waiters.

    "essay": "In the era of advanced technology, robots are more and more common in our lives. The issue of whether robotics can benefit or hurt humans is widely debated. I believe that robots are crucial to human's future development, but they can also make negative impact if we do not regulate them.\n\nIt is generally accepted that robotics can assist the advancement of mankind since they are automation tools and thus they can significantly simplify our lives. In other words, robots or machines are able to extricate people from performing regular and repetitive tasks. For example, automatic manufacturing devices can accurately form and assemble products, which saves people lots of time and energy for production. Eventually, because people spend less and less time in boring works, people will have extra energy to carry out more valuable and meaningful affairs, such as inventing new items and formulating strategies for protecting environment.\n\nOn the other hand, robots may hurt humanity if they are poorly invented and regulated. As we may know, robots or machines are basically sets of programs and mechanisms developed by people. If codes or mechanical parts in robots are not well crafted, catastrophic results are highly likely to happen. For instance, robots that serve the purpose of cleaning can hit and even impair people if their moving systems do not function correctly. More serious accidents can occur if robots are not examined and checked carefully before they are sold to the public.\n\nIn conclusion, robots are greatly beneficial to the furtherance of humanity.

    "essay": "Since time immemorial, the invention of artificial intelligence has been man's major objective. There is an ongoing argument about the presence of robots on planet earth. Many people believe that it will be a great innovation while others think it will have adverse effects. This essay would take an exhaustive look at these views while I conclude with my own opinion. \n\n   One major reason why robots are important to human survival is that  they help ease labour. In today's world, many construction companies and factories tend to be more productive by introducing artificial intelligence to their daily operations which makes production and construction seamless and more effective. In 2009, Jung Sung a textile factory owner from China stated that production has skyrocketed by 200% since they introduced artificial intelligence into their manufacturing process. Robots are essential for the reduction of human labour they help increase productivity.\n\n    The major negative side of robots' reality is that they will cause unemployment. Hence, there would be no jobs left for humans due to the inability to compete with automated technologies that are specially created to be way more effective than humans. In 2012, the Chinese government carried out  research which stated the cause of unemployment in their economy and it was concluded that the existence of  artificial intelligence reduced employment drastically. It is pertinent to say that introducing robots to planet earth will reduce job opportunities.\n\n   Conclusively, robots can be a source of unemployment for humans but we can say that the existence of robots has lots of merits such as high productivity in labour and effective operations due to the way they have been programmed to work tirelessly without rest. The invention of robots would aid growth which would help factories, construction sites and other related organizations beat their set targets due to the initiative.",

However, robots, in my opinion, are more on the side of liberating humanity from monotonous jobs and unleashing our creativity.\n\nPeople have negative thinking about robots for a variety of reasons. First, it must be mentioned that automation could eliminate jobs that can be done by robots instead. So that, a large scale of unemployment could happen. Additionally, investment in the robotics field makes the budget for other important areas limited such as healthcare, scientific research. Furthermore, mechanization has deskilled many workers which could delete some specific jobs. For example, the baristas become less valued at work by virtue of being replaced by coffee machines.\n\nBesides these above human concerns, the vision of a new modern world where humans will take the role of creators, and artificial intelligence will create machines to realize those creations. One of the benefits that robots bring to people's lives is that they are programmed to perform tasks with high precision such as performing surgeries. Plus, they can increase proficiency at work thanks to higher speed and consistency. For instance, instead of using one hundred employees working in a production line, businesses only need 1 to 2 robots to operate that whole line with a shorter time or even many lines at the same time. Finally, artificial intelligence enables robots to learn from experience, adapt to new inputs, and execute human-like activities thereby boosting the quality of life.\n\nTo conclude, albeit disadvantageous in some cases, I believe that robots will not take over the majority of employment.

Although robots may have made people technology-dependent, I believe that the quality of work will improve and be error-free with robotics.\n\nOn the one hand, using robotic technology, people become more dependent on machines and lazy. People spend more time watching TV or browsing the internet rather than doing their day-to-day work as robots work for them like a robot vacuum cleaner. As a result, people become more reclusive, less social, and lazy and will potentially get into several health concerns such as obesity and overweight related health diseases.\n\nOn the other hand, some people believe that robots enable people to work effectively and provide error-free results. Robots are programmed which minimize the errors humans usually can make. That degree of error can be minimal, like a typo error or massive during some surgeries, which can be fatal. In my opinion, I agree with this viewpoint as robots minimize mistakes; therefore, one can save time and energy to rectify the error. For example, recent research found that humans perform some surgical procedures that take 5-8 hours; when experimented with robots, scientists found a reduction in time by 1-2 hours with almost zero errors.\n\nIn conclusion, although robots make people lazy and less social, I believe robots save time and minimize human errors; therefore, they are beneficial for the future.",

While Scientist's from across the globe argue that this is a right time for Artificial Intelligence to start control the world. However, others argue that giving complete authority to the machine can have some serious drawbacks, which will risk human's life at workplace. I strongly believe that there should be balanced automation technology for better future, which human can control if it is necessary. However, I will explain the both sides of the question with examples. \n\nThere is an ample evidence to show that automated machines can produce significantly more amount of production when compare to humans. Which means, automated machine can do 5 people's work in one hour with less manpower. In the same way, R&D departments form various industries providing more employment opportunities for graduates to develop advance machines. For example, economically developed countries like the USA, Germany and UK already deployed automated machines in manufacturing industries. As a result, more production can be done in short time. \n\nOn the other hand, some commentators suggest that too much of automation technology at workplace can lead to serious outbreaks. For instance, machines have no control of taking decisions on their own, unless someone can programme them to do so, mistakenly, if a person is standing at the machine operated location, he can be injured. While recent study from the University of Melbourne states that, if automation technology started expanded, unemployment rate will increase more likely to 25 percent in Australia. \n\nIn conclusion, I strongly recommend that automation machines at industries will provide large amount of production in short time. However, too much of automation will make humans lazier in future. There should be balanced workload where machine and human can do.",

Secondly, some coursework cannot apply to daily life such as advanced physics and maths. Then, many lessons are full of details to memory. For instance, pupils have to read more sources to find the right answer for the test. Moreover, in one semester, children have to learn more than 6 or 7 coursework. More of them affect students' leisure time. The effects are kids cannot find the proper break to rest and some teenagers have to use their personal hours to review the book.\n\nIn terms of solving the significant issue, both family and school have to corporate and give advice to the pupils. First, institutes should hold an annual meeting between parents and principle. For example, parents could share their kids' behaviour with teachers. Next, the lessons have to be varied for students to choose up to their interests. More sports and arts curricula must be included.

First and foremost, due to enough sleep and lack of nutrition are the one causes of this problem. To illustrate this, nowadays, students are busy solving their assignments, this is because they got more homework from school, and as a result, they have no sufficient time to sleep. In addition, children are more aware to eat fast-food beverages instead of healthy foods for that reason they fall  sick and do not focus on their studies in institutions. For example, fast food like burgers and rolls are more popular food and liked by billion of children but it affects negatively  their health. Also, due to electronic devices students are spending  more time  watching phones and tablets, which is  another reason for this problem.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some solutions to eliminate this problem. Firstly, students should take nap properly, which will be helpful for their studies. For example, it is scientifically proven that for better focus on work and study people should sleep at least 8 hours, which helps to relax their mind and grow effectively. Secondly, children should it more healthy foods like apples and oranges which contain more nutrition. Furthermore, teachers should give the minimum amount of homework to their students, which helps children to free and relax their minds and pay better attention during  class periods.\n\nIn conclusion, due to lack of sleep and nutrition along with using more electronic devices children are lacking to concentrate on their studies in the classroom. However, taking more healthy food and a proper nap helps them to focus on their studies in school.",

It is believed that kids find it tough to focus on their studies during school. This essay will illustrate the causes and the solution to their difficulties.\n\n First of all,  youngsters finding it difficult due to the use of methods while teaching nowadays, in most of the  Western countries they follow modern ways of teaching along with different techniques to uphold their focus in education, therefore, management should include animations, effects to make the class more interesting. Moreover, each class consist of a huge number of pupils which results in a lack of attention. In addition to this, working hours of the schools nowadays have been increased, it's the main reason behind the youngster's lack of interest in education and lack of sports or any extracurricular activities which make them boredom and inactive.\n\nOn the other hand, along with the studies Management should also focus on the health of the younger children. They should build up some playgrounds and activity grounds where kids can have some relax and sporty time there. Nevertheless, the authorities should arrange the students and teachers meetings every weekend by that they can resolve their problems. Moreover, they should keep separate classes for the smarter students so that the lecturer can give full time to one who is lacking behind.\n\nIn conclusion, the way of education may vary from time to time still it is the responsibility of the organisation to maintain the system by initiating various ways of educating. The students should also discuss difficulties with the management. Counselling should be initiated between parents, students and teachers.",

    "essay": "Not being able to focus on class is one of the main concerns in the early-age learning journey. From educational perspectives, there are two main reasons which are the mismatched learning styles, and long-term exposure to poor nutrition and lack of sleep. \n\nFirstly, it is irrefutable that we all learn differently, and so do children. Some learn best by seeing, hearing or doing. Therefore, if the teachers only emphasize a specific learning style and apply it to all the children, this can result in a lack of focus and understanding. In this case, the solution is to ask the teachers to observe what are the options that they can choose to engage children in their learning experiences. For example, inquiry-based learning projects can be planned and adapted to search for the right methods. \n\nSecondly, it is sad to state, but, indeed, children cannot focus on their studies simply because they do not get enough sleep or nutrition. In fact, there are circumstances where many children do not have enough recommended sleeping hours or have to skip breakfast to be on time. Consequently, these children do not have energy and become distracted in class. As adults, we need to take our steps to reduce the numbers of children who have physical disadvantages. Government, schools and families have to work together to build up better schedules so children can have more time to sleep. Besides, they also must have free-food programs for poor children to make sure they are full when they study. \n\nIn conclusion, there are many reasons which could lead to the failure of paying attention in the classroom. However, from my perspective, mismatched learning styles and lack of nutrition and sleep are the main causes. Together with families, governments and schools have to work on their policies in teaching methods and free-food programs to support children more.",

    "essay": "In recent years, the concept of \"responsible tourism\" has gained popularity, as more and more people have become aware of the impact that tourism can have on both culture and the environment. Responsible tourism is defined as tourism that takes into account the social, cultural, and environmental impact of travel, and seeks to minimize negative effects while maximizing positive effects. However, some argue that it is impossible to be a \"responsible tourist\" due to the nature of tourism itself.\n\nOn one hand, it is true that tourism can have negative impacts on both culture and the environment. For example, in areas where tourism is concentrated, local cultures can be threatened by commercialization and homogenization. Additionally, tourism can lead to overcrowding, pollution, and the degradation of natural environments. It is also true that many people travel to popular destinations without considering the impact of their visit on the local community and the environment.\n\nOn the other hand, it is also true that tourism can have positive impacts on both culture and the environment if it is done responsibly. Responsible tourism can help to preserve and promote cultural heritage, by supporting local communities and promoting sustainable practices. It can also help to protect the environment by encouraging sustainable travel and reducing the impact of tourism on natural resources.\n\nIn conclusion, it is not impossible to be a \"responsible tourist\". While it is true that tourism can have negative impacts on both culture and the environment, it is also true that tourism can have positive impacts if it is done responsibly.

    "essay": "Exploring unfamiliar destinations with families or friends has always been considered one of the best approaches to enjoying a holiday, whereas, the problem aroused by this phenomenon has been obvious that individuals should be accountable for the consequence of their behaviours. As I am concerned, responsibility for cherishing and preserving the surroundings during the tour ought to be taken by everyone.\n\nFirstly, cultures and environment are priceless and irreversible resources for humans, that is to say, only protecting them from unforeseeable influence brought by increasing touring demands is the most effective way to prolong their lifespans of them, like minor ethnic culture and splendid sightseeing. Secondly, human actions possibly affect cultures and the environment. For example, visitors need to abide by the customs and conventions which the locals always do, otherwise, unpredictable conflicts or risks would be triggered to cause damage whatever is tangible or intangible. In short, the preservation of culture and the environment is essential.\n\nHowever, the responsibility should not lie to tourists only, namely, authorities also should issue relative laws to define whether the action taken by tourists is legal or not based on the principle of keeping cultures and environment safe. For instance, the local government could build tour centres for guiding visitors to tour in a good manner and set warning signs to alert visitors in case they misbehaviour unintentionally.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly support the idea that tourists should raise their awareness of protecting cultures and the environment from harm rather than posing potential threats to them. Meanwhile, the local administration ought to take measures to maintain the present status and assist foreign tourists to actively conform to the regulation.",

    "essay": "It is undoubtedly the case that the urban areas are suffering from high volume traffic congestion. There are many arguments for this problem and plenty of solutions to mitigate this issue. In this essay, I will discuss the criterion and also highlight some solutions that should be taken by the government authorities. \n\nThe very first step is to find out the argument behind a wide range of gridlock. In brief, there are several reasons for the rising traffic jams. Firstly, one of the major causes is overpopulation of the city areas. Most of the offices and factories are situated in urban areas which is why job opportunities are comparatively higher in the towns than in rural areas. For this instance, most of the village people migrate to the city space for the sake of getting a job. Secondly, cars are now more affordable for massive consumers. Most of the job holders are trying to reach the office by the car without any co-passenger except the driver , therefore, roads are blocked with cars in office hours and cause serious movement issues. Thirdly, the roads and lanes are not well constructed. The unorganized roads are a great reason for high-rise traffic.\n\nTo solve this critical problem the government should take some necessary steps. Some of the factories should be shifted to different rural areas therefore, many people will also shift to those areas for their job purposes. The tax rate on cars should be increased. If the tax rate is high then it will not be so easy to maintain the cost of a car and there will be fewer cars on the road. Eco-friendly vehicles like bicycles can be used for easy transportation instead of cars. Finally, the authorities should construct the road in a proper way and develop separate lanes for trucks and buses. \n\nTo sum up, traffic jams can be caused by many reasons. If the government and general people work in a proper way to solve this problem then it is possible to get rid of this high volume of traffic.",

According to this, the city side has available more facilities and industries compared to the countryside side. Plenty of  people stay city only. It is their desirable one. So this is the reason the city side increased traffic level. Tremendously, the city side has transportation facilities like  city bus city buses, cars and motorcycles.\n\n On one hand, traffic is one of the main problems for humans. Usually, people used it daily in their personal vehicles. Meanwhile, people use this repetitively in the daytime. Because of this some other people also facing this traffic problem. There are mainly three reasons for the increased this traffic. Firstly, families want to consume their own car. Although, some affluent people's families, each individual people have one car. Secondly, the Urban area has more public transport like buses, city trains and metro train facilities available. Thirdly, people want to work by car.\n\n \n\n On another hand, the Government should take care of  action and implement  more rules to reduce the traffic level. In Addition, such as rules for decreasing  car travel on a daily basis  only allowing single-digit count car numbers to drive one day and double-digit cars to be allowed  the next day,Meanwhile those people used  public transportation. For this scheduled basis only people allowed to use the cars also traffic inspector to observe this and someone misused the rules should put a huge level  of fine. Moreover,  some industries such as software companies, allowed to their employees work from home option. As well as reducing the traffic in this way.\n\n \n\n To Conclude, There are a variety of different factors that have led to rising levels of traffic in urban areas. While it may not possible to find a complete solution,  action should be involved to encourage  people and create  awareness to reduce  traffic. Furthermore, taxes on private cars should be increased and eco-friendly transportation like bicycles should be promoted.",

For instant, in one family if there are five people which means they will be having average of two to three vehciles.

In my view, there is too much population currently and cause high deservation of car use, and the government should promote well-equipped public transport to solve these issues.\n\nNowadays, the population is sharply growing, promoting the deservation of private car use and the need for public transportation. As a result, traffic jams and car crashes frequently happen both in the city and town, enhancing severe traffic conditions. For example, the traffic condition is terrible during the rush hour in the morning and evening, too many people driving their cars to work and back home at the same time and crowded the road quickly.\n\nIt is commonly believed that too much driving may cause air pollution.

This essay will illustrate the reasons for the disturbing growth in traffic congestion, and in addition to that, it will shed light on the solutions to avoid it in subsequent paragraphs.\n\nTo begin with, the predominant reason for unprecedented growth in traffic is flexible rules. To illustrate this view, cities like New Delhi and Bangalore have recorded the highest number of traffic penalties in the last three years and yet, these cities charge the bare minimum in road fines. Moreover, another critical reason that yields humongous traffic is overpopulation. Overpopulation leads to mismanagement and consequently, that results in inexorable chaos.\n\nIn order to manage a huge volume of automobiles on the road, the government should come up with stringent rules. For instance, the Gulf countries have imposed exorbitant fines pertaining to breaking traffic rules. This ensures the citizens of the country avoid breaking rules. Lastly, the concerning bodies should promote public transport in the nation. In addition to that, there should be a limitation on the usage of private vehicles. To exemplify, the Chief Minister of Delhi introduced an Odd-Even policy that allowed only odd and even car numbers to run on alternate days respectively. This resulted in bringing down the traffic.\n\nTo conclude, the unexpected growth in traffic congestion is due to lenient rules and overpopulation. To manage the chaos on roads, the governing bodies should impose adamant traffic rules and exorbitant penalties.",

    "essay": "For the past decades,traffic jam has been one of the issues that many countries are often facing. From my standpoint, there two major causes of these problems are transportation is getting more affordable and we are currently working in a mobile society.Therefore, the main point of this essay is to discuss these troubles to the solution.\n\nTo begin with,for the last 30 years, transportation such as cars and motorbikes are rated as luxury items. However,as the world develops with a growth in GDP and more new car industrials are being introduced hence quite a people nowadays are managed to afford a car or even more. Moreover, it is convenient for people to travel by cars or motorbikes because of its saving time and energy also comfortable feeling. Hence, the pavement is filled up with numerous kinds of moving thus leads to  plenty of logjam cases, as a result, people will get frustrated and suffered from waiting in order to continue on their journey. Yet,this troublesome complication can be tackled by encouraging citizens to travel by bus or MRT to eliminate the bottleneck as well as the number of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide for instance.\n\nOn the other hand, another reason for transportation has become prominent is the ambulatory of labouring. For example,a commercial business company is presumably to locate at the centre of a city so it is understandable for pupils to have an excursion from home to office.Nonetheless, since the culture of working time has a lot in similarity hence at some peak periods, countless folk have been sailing at the same moment, as a result,as a result, this position precipitating a chaotic movement along the highway.A solution to this concern is to have a diversity of running time for each district in a state,in that event, a strong reduction is expected to obtain for the sake of well-organised traffic.\n\nIn conclusion,these informative details are to indicate the main leads to  concerns.Although they   are feasible to deal with,still ,the best prevention to this trouble is  indeed one's awareness because even governments are endeavoured to convince them to drive civilly ,there are some individual can be reckless on their driving and attended to a snarl-up.",

In this essay, we will discuss about the reasons of the same and a solution to resolve this issue.\n\nRise in numbers of cars on road is an important factor for increase in traffic nowadays. However, people having cars for one individual self actually causes surge in volume of traffic in the entire world. Survey by E & Y for Europe states that 57% of traffic is because of an individual travelling by a car whereas buses, trains remains empty. Therefore, this problem can be sorted by carpooling, use of public transport, avoiding use of cars just for oneself. Hence, huge volume of traffic will always be an issue in some places where people tend to prefer travelling by personal cars rather than public transport.\n\nOffice hubs are more likely to have traffic majorly at office timings. Almost every person has a car and has to reach office on time. Therefore, traffic is always high at specific times in these areas. Survey by KPMG reflects, Gurgaon (India) is busiest from 9-11 AM in the mornings and 6-9 PM in the evenings. However, office traffics can also be resolved through managing better office timeliness by the employees and better road infrastructure by the government. This will help to reduce and divert traffic via other routes and timings.\n\nI would like to end by stating that better measures and steps has to be taken by the government to build better road infrastructure, restrict car manufacturing and arrange to assist public transport to help people commute more effectively and efficiently.",

There are several reasons for this problem and various measures can be taken by both induviduals and governments to imrove this problem.\n\nThere are two main factors that have led to the rise in traffic in towns and cities. One of the major causes is that the ownership of cars have been increasing in many societies, which means the vehicles become more affordable for the average people and they are no longer a luxury item, but something that most families expect to own. The second reason is that public transport has become increasingly unreliable and uncomfortable because many bus and train services are often delayed and not frequent. As a result, there has been a rise in the use of private cars, leading to the high volume of traffic, especially in rush hours.\n\nDespite the obvious reasons above,there are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems.Firstly, a simple solution would be to improve the reliability of public transport to encourage people to take the bus or the train rather than driving their own car. The second measure would be for governments to discourage people from driving to work by imposing special tariffs on using the roads, especially during peak periods. A successful example of this is the congestion fee in London which has certainly reduced the level of traffic in the city centre.\n\nIn conclusion, despite some obvious reasons, various measures can be taken to tackle the problem of rising levels of traffic in urban areas. While it may not be possible to find a complete solution, any action should probably involve encouraging greater use of public transport and making it more expensive for people to drive in urban areas.",

A solution is for government to improve the efficiency, reliance, and comfort of public transport, which would encourage people to take public transport in order to reduce the use of personal cars. \n\n              Another problem is that infrastructure of major cities is inadequate to deal with high volume of traffic. When it comes to business development, more and more people go to work in the urban so the demand for roads have gradually increased. This issue could be tackled by the government building overpasses and underpasses to deal with the roads that cannot handle high volume of traffic. As a result, it would improve the problem of traffic jam and save people's time to work\n\n              In conclusion, there is no doubt that the problem of traffic congestion has serious impact on people's lives so the government plays a key role in tackling this issue. Therefore, it should be addressed as soon as possible, otherwise people could end up facing more traffic problems.",

    "essay": "When it comes to emergency issues, some said that they should only rely on help from other nations to solve the problems, while other individuals think that the incidents can be deal with by supports in the country. I personally disagree with the statement that we depend on global scale cooperations to solve the crisis, since there could be drawbacks to counting on foreign supports.\n\nFirstly, it takes more time for anther nationsâs support to arrive. Since the problem is urgent, counting on help from other countries could lead to miss the best opportunity to deal with the situation immediately. Also, local support team who are located closer to the site can respond to the issue immediately by gathering up resources and planning the solutions. All in all, local people can respond to the problem more quickly in order to mitigate the situation.\n\n\tSecondly, it is hard to organize support teams and resources come from different countries when an emergency crisis occurred, since the situation could be chaotic with  the spread of misleading informations. Also, the language barrier could be a difficulties since not all foreign personnel familiar with the local language and customs, so it might be difficult for them to support in the site. On the other hands, local emergency services personnel can communicate directly with the victims using their native language, which can speed up the processes and avoiding misunderstanding. As a result, domestic rescues are more supportive due to familiarity of local culture and language.\n\n\tOverall, I support that urgent situations can be solved by national emergency services with faster respond time and the knowledge of local environment.",

    "essay": "Never before has the public been so concerned about early-age education. Some people argue that the involvement of parents in story-reading is necessary while the rest believe that children benefit more from gathering information on their own. From my perspective, although the guidance from family to form a reading habit is indispensable, it is more beneficial to read independently. \n\nWithout doubts, parents play a significant role in the early development of children. Generally speaking, story-telling empowers children to become curious. By listening to fairy tales from parents, children can learn about  nature and  history. They would also generate various questions about the society that they are living in from these tales, which helps to develop their creativity. Another point worth mentioning is that it takes time and efforts for children to be mature enough to read the storybooks or to understand the contents from the TV show, thus the supports from family at an early stage become more important.\n\nDespite the difficulty for children to acquire information from books and TVs directly at an early age, it is still indispensable to develop their learning skills. First of all, reading independently is the best opportunity to form a reading habit for children, and their reading and writing skills can be trained during their self-reading. By contrast, only listening to stories may ultimately lead to  over-reliance on parents, and it is detrimental to their future study in school. In addition, stories from parents are prone to be limited to their own knowledge, while tremendous helpful and fresh information, such as stories that can trigger childrenâs interests in math, can be found in books, which contributes to a more balanced development for the youngsters. \n\nTo put everything into consideration, supports from parents in story-telling promote creativity and curiosity for children at young age. However, not only does independent reading contributes to the writing and reading skills of children, but also it enables them to get access to a wider range of knowledge, which leads to  more balanced development.",

For example, at the of the news on newspapers, it always mentioned the name of the author and where it was published. Therefore, people can base on it to get the news without confusion whether the new is true or not.  \n\nOn the other hand, it is media that allow people to get the news. This is because media helps readers catch up with the news immediately and contains variety of sources of information. For instances, Internet can allow people access through many websites in seconds without waiting so long and it not only provides texts about the news like traditional way, but also contains colored pictures and videos. This helps readers save time but also absorb enough information in the news were posted on other media.  \n\nIn conclusion, personally, both ways for readers to get the news are effective.

In my opinion, I see museums as a place where people can do both fun and get knowledge.\n\nOn the one hand, not everyone in this world enjoy visiting a monument because most of the people are not really interested in history or geography. Furthermore, they will be bored if there is no something funny to see. For instance, research reveals that more than 30% of teenagers that went to museums felt no enjoyable.

For example, in Yogyakarta, there is a house that constructed into a museum that show Indonesian history. Because of this, tourists and visitors can see real-life example of a country history, and they can get education that they can not get in schools.\n\nIn conclusion, although a function of museums is to educate people, it is not wrong to turn museums into entertainment places.",

Personally, I agree with the point that a museum is a container that collects advanced technologies and knowledge, allowing people to learn a lot.\n\nThere are some reasons why some people think that museums ought to provide joy and happiness. Firstly, the primary reason is that museums are public places and aim to attract visitors. This means that these places need to provide tourists with stunning goods and impressive things instead of education. In other words, people are less likely to visit a museum with the purpose of learning something. Secondly, the average visitor may become bored if he or she has to read or listen to too much educational content, so museums often put more  emphasis on enjoyment rather than learning. \n\nOn the other hand, some people argue that museums should focus on education. The aim of any exhibition should be to teach visitors something that they did not previously know. Usually this means that the history behind the museum's exhibits needs to be explained, and this can be done in various ways. Some museums employ professional guides to talk to their visitors, while other museums offer headsets so that visitors can listen to detailed commentary about the exhibition. In this way, museums can play an important role in teaching people about history, culture, science and many other aspects of life.\n\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that a good museum should be able to able to offer an interesting, enjoyable and educational experience so that people can have fun and learn something at the same time.",

In other words, In this fast-paced era, the Majority of the masses do work or study which not only lead to franchised scheduler but also deprives them to provide relief to their minds.

Hence, museums should be enjoyable owing to a stress-free life. \n\nShifting toward the final view of how art galleries can connect a multitude among ancestors if they are educational.  To elaborate it, By, visiting museums individuals can enhance their knowledge about their culture and part of their elders which can assist them in their future as when they read about their ancestors they can get experience which can reduce the chance of errors which their elders did in the past because of this they can do the work effectively.

Teaching visitors something they did not know previously should be the crucial intention of any exhibition. It means that the origins behind the museum exhibits` should be explained in detail. In this way, museums have to hire experienced professionals in order to talk to visitors. Thus, they are inclined to make a great contribution in teaching people about history, science and many other scientific domains.\n\nOn the other hand, the nation considers arguable the view that museums` basic role is entertainment. The basic intention of museums is to collect the exhibits based on the visitors` interests and preferences. In this way, they are prone to attract more and more tourists and make a big profit from entertaining. There is a great possibility for the conventional visitor to become bored if he or she has to read and listen to too much cognitive content, therefore museums are focused on enjoyment compared to studying.

A segment of society opines that the sole aim of museums is to entertain folks; diametrically opposed to this, others believe that these places are more useful in imparting invaluable cultural value to the young generation. Both statements may advance equally compelling arguments, but I inclined the second notion for the reasons which are explained in the following paragraphs.\n\nFirst and foremost, museums are the buildings that hold  invaluable information regarding the ancient era of human civilisation. How the human species have had been evolved from the first phase of the life cycle is clearly depicted in this architecture with pictures. For instance, the national museum Delhi has diverse articles from the magnificent ancient era including the statues of the kings of that period and their accessories like jewellery and clothes. Thereby, apparent visuals of these articles longer last than reading; these structures are the source of knowledge for those who are keen on exploring history.\n\nMoving further, thanks to globalisation, it is easy to travel and investigate  other countries around the globe. The popularity of these monuments attract  tourists, therefore it would be cooler if these buildings have  modern amenities like air-conditioned halls and better visibility of the accessories, safe security system where children can roam and enjoy themselves to the fullest with their parents.\n\nTo conclude then, whilst there exist contrasting stances on the matter, it is taxing work to decide which one have a more positive outcome, howbeit, undoubtedly, museums are the prime source of ancient cultures and can upgrade the youngsters with the history, but it would be impeccable if these buildings have offered some entertainment along with a safe environment to the sightseers.",

In contrast, some groups of people argue that this action is not true ,and students will be studying in the school. However, I surely agree that students will  study online more than study in schools in the future, and I will explain  why I believe that education will be changing. \n\nFirst of all, many colleges are using new innovations such as Google Classroom, Google Meet and Zoom in their schools, and these programs are very useful for them. For example, when COVID-19 was happening, many students could study from their homes. In addition, many academic tutors have  used online programs to teach their lessons.

Although there are several reasons for this forecast, I believe that this kind of teaching model plays an indispensable role in studentsâ acquisition of knowledge.\n\nOn the one hand, advocates of this idea may have some rationales to argue that the year 2050 will not record the presence of the existing learning model. Firstly, the introduction of online learning platforms has enabled learners to access information regardless of physical barriers. For example, students in different countries can have access to a variety of knowledge from physics to arts with the clicks of the mouse, which facilitates learners from long distances. Moreover, recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been introduced in educational sectors, which assesses studentsâ learning process and then dispenses personalized instructions as well as feedback with astonishing accuracy rates. All of which used to be the functionality of teachers and therefore, the physical presence of educators has been questioned. \n\nHowever, although technology innovation offers learners a wide variety of knowledge, students may not comprehensively understand it. For example, whether an unemotional and rigid teaching machine can convey knowledge as efficiently as teachers whose teaching approach is varied to suit different types of students. They can be amiable and helpful to students who struggle with acquiring knowledge or strict to learners who slack off their studies. Furthermore, the learning process is not only the acquisition of theoretical knowledge but also practical skills. A classroom that includes the physical presence of students and teachers plays a role as a small-scale society and therefore students in the class have the opportunity to be exposed to different counterparts with different characteristics, therefore, improving their interpersonal skills and team-working skills. \n\nIn conclusion, although the role of teachers and existing learning models are under threat due to technological innovation, I believe they can not be replaced because they bring about many benefits for studentsâs academic performance and practical skills.",

In the nearest future, maybe, there will be no teachers in the traditional way of understanding their purpose. Robots and various educational platforms will replace professors and face-to-face communication. For example, some Japanese schools have been using robots in the study process during several years and the average level of knowledge has not suffered till now, even it has slightly improved. Thus, there is no doubt that in 30 years there will be another considerable change in an educational sphere. \n\nSecondly, more and more schools in different countries have decided to change their teaching approaches. Nowadays, modern teachers prefer to become mentors for their students. It can be explained by the fact that self-education is more effective than the common way of learning. For instance, some American schools have started to implement the mentioned approach in their practice. The result was stunning as pupils have showed better performance and, consequently, better grades for exams. Hence, it can be predicted by experts that there are no reasons to stay conservative and refuse opportunities for the development. \n\nTo sum up, I absolutely agree that the usual teaching method can be replaced by more innovative one.

Researchers say that it is too hard to deeply focus and cover the subjects for students online. Teachers do not just give subjects and also teach the children the ways of life. Students learn how to socialise, make a friend and other emotional aspects to possible counter in the future. And also students whose parents both work, they need to somewhere to continue their educational life.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe the popularity of the online education system has been an increase. However, schools are not place where student learn to just subject but also they learn the ways of life in practical and emotional. So I strongly believe, the typical learning system will continue.",

    "essay": "The education system is improving digitally nowadays across the world. Some people think that the traditional teaching methods in the classrooms between a teacher and students would disappear by the year 2050. This essay will discuss why the typical teaching demonstration will disappear eventually.\n\nThe typical form of teaching system has been quite popular in many countries since historic times.This will assist students in learning discipline and respecting others besides education. For example, kids going to educational institutions will wear uniform dresses and reach school on time daily, though there are certain obstructions. Pupils will be demonstrated not only discipline but also how to respect fellow students. For instance, sessions are conducted related to team building activities where students will be taught on how to work in a team and help their members when needed.\n\nHowever, online teaching platforms are replacing the traditional form in the recent times because they are cost effective and also Eco friendly. Parents will not spend so much of money for school fees since e-learning is cost effective. To illustrate, there are many leading online platforms which offer classes for affordable packages. Moreover, this method also improves the quality of air since the school buses and other vehicles transporting students will not run. To give a clear example, the pollution caused by those vehicles carrying students will be declined significantly which therefore, improves the air quality.\n\nTo conclude, the typical teaching situation of a student and teacher in the class will not exist in the future. I completely agree with this statement since online learning is gradually replacing the current teaching system.",

    "essay": "It is argued that there should be more open squared spaces and colossal parks in all cities and towns. I do completely agree with the given statement and would give supportive points in this essay. \n\nFirstly, places like parks and gardens with beautiful flowering plants and trees provide an identity to a city or town and undoubtedly provide considerable benefits to the surrounding community.  Furthermore, these are beneficial for personal health as well. \n\nFor instance, children can have outdoor sports, and adults after their busy tiring work life can have a relaxed time as well as can do routine walking in a healthy space. \n\nSuch spaces allow citizens to appreciate nature's arts and to have knowledge and connections with its vast beauty among city skyscrapers, industries and other townhouses. One can easily understand and appreciate this while sitting in the Royal Botanical Garden in Melbourne City or Hyde Park in  London. These cities are recognized by these gardens and attract even tourists.\n\nAnother very significant point is about their role in cleaning pollution. As we know, these days air pollution is a major issue due to traffic and factories and it is considerably affecting people's health. Therefore, it is essentially a requirement these days to have spaces on every corner with implanted trees and plants in the form of squared spaces and central bigger parks. Trees and surrounding greeneries clean atmospheric pollution by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. \n\nThis thus keeps people away from many air-borne diseases and stress and they can work more efficiently with a healthy body and mind. \n\nIn conclusion, it is a fundamental need nowadays to build parks in the cities and towns for the benefit of its people and  our earth and I completely agree with the given statement.",

    "essay": "It has been frequently argued that urban areas ought to keep space for playgrounds or public parks. I completely agree with the statement as it could bring ample benefits to the life of dwellers and the same would be discussed in the upcoming paragraphs.\n\nTo begin with, if all cities would construct beautiful gardens, specifically for each area, it could have the following benefits. Initially, parks or grounds, which  have been maintained properly with flowers and trees would provide the best view. Consequently, they could visit frequently there and get relief from mental stress and fatigue for the whole day. Besides,  these places are merely sources of fresh air in developed areas as most of these areas are covered with buildings and roads. For instance, the harmful gases or the pollution exhausted by vehicles could be purified by planting trees since they consume carbon dioxide and exhale fresh air that is oxygen in surroundings, subsequently, inhabitants could consume fresh air.\n\nFurthermore, human beings could utilise public parks for spending quality time and it is useful for them in plenty of ways. Firstly, children could play outdoor sports on a daily basis and it would provide a plethora of advantages to their health. For example, in concrete areas, they could barely enjoy as they have to play video games or operate electronic gadgets in their  spare time, whereas, open places would encourage them to play. Apart from this, adults could go for morning and evening walks, therefore, they could get relief from health problems.\n\nIn conclusion, if councils would provide space and build gardens for dwellers, it could provide them with many benefits and they could lead a healthy and happy life.",

    "essay": "Some people believe that it should have many attractive venues in urban cities. I partly agree with this notion and show some underlying ideas why they are reasonable.\n\nThere are two primary reasons why large towns have to be displayed different tourist attractions. First and foremost, these public places benefit the tourism industry in a particular town. A wide range of outdoor sites enhances both international and local people passing by and broadcasting to the world. For example, Ben Thanh Market is a well-known place that tourists will have to visit a once-in-a-lifetime if they are going to Ho Chi Minh City, also known as Sai Gon. In addition, a park is an ideal place where people are able to do exercise or go jogging in the cool weather. With a lot of greenery, beautiful landscapes surrounded the place, which gives people a positive energy to motivate them to keep healthy.\n\nApart from the practical benefits expressed above, I believe that there are some potential drawbacks.\n\nFirstly, if there are too many huge outdoor places constructed in the cities, there is not enough space for pedestrians in the crowded towns. People may be caught in vehicle accidents because they have to walk on the main street. Secondly, the expenses for refurbishing large buildings are extremely high. Although local authorities surely do not neglect the environmental aspect and vandalization, it is unavoidable. \n\nIn conclusion, despite there are some disadvantages that have the capacity of addressing the tackle someday, developing the tourism side for the finance of cities and providing a chilling environment for people can be considerable.",

    "essay": "It is true that most green public areas are currently replaced by several buildings in cities, since people do not realize how those areas are important. However, some people believe that benefits of parks and squares for people and societies are more than those of business buildings. From my point of view, public spaces should be built because of numerous reasons. \n\nFirst of all, creating parks improves mental and physical health of people. People currently stay alone in small square rooms condominiums in the cities, and there are a few public spaces where people can use to do activities. Hence, having squares and parks assists people to alleviate stress, since they can gather with their peers and families to do activities such as picnics and playing sports in huge green places, making them feel relaxed and enjoy. Furthermore, establishing green places encourages people to play more sports and exercise as in the cities, spaces are limited for some popular sports such as football and running, so green parks will be new places where attract people to enhance physical health.\n\nSecondly, governments can use squares to support local people in certain careers to generate income. To clarify, governments can launch campaigns to promote art or music by allowing groups of artists to establish exhibitions or clubs to attract interested people. This not only appeals to locals but also tourists to understand and inspire in art and music. In addition, locals can use these public areas to create and display innovative events and concerts to enhance their opportunities to sell local products and tickets to domestic and foreign customers to gain more income.\n\nIn conclusion, creating public areas including parks and squares provides numerous advantages to individualsâ physical and mental health. Additionally, locals also gain benefits from parks by creating special events and gaining revenue from them.",

Having a spacious public outdoor area not only cost a huge amount of taxpayers money but also need to use a huge public space source which ought to have better usage than squares or parks. For example, in some developing cities,they can not afford the expend of building large public amusement park which is a waste of governmentâs fund that could be poured in education or the local economy so that could change local society instead of a park. \n\nOn the other hand, the public area can not be fully used due to the less population, even if there is a large public in some tiny cities.It turns out that is a waste of money as well. However, things will completely different in metropolitans, because a large number of populations have more need for amusement. So, there is no need for small towns and tiny cities to have a large public area, especially for those developing cities and those that have less population.\n\nIn summary, metropolitans could afford the expend of building a large public area instead of tiny and underdeveloped cities, besides less population also will result in a waste of money due to the low-frequency usage.So, that is not paramount for all towns and cities to have large public outdoor places",

    "essay": "It is sometimes argued about the importance of the existence of public areas such as squares and parks in modern societies. While I agree that these areas bring many benefits to societies and the spiritual life of citizens, I think it would not be possible to have them everywhere as well.\n\nOn the one hand, there are several perks of having public areas in all administrative units. Firstly, public places such as squares and parks could help improve air quality which is degraded in many modern cities. These places are often compared to the green lungs of cities, which could help minimize the negative environmental impacts by a large number of green trees and their ability to absorb rainwater and reduce flooding that occurs when the rainy seasons arrive. Secondly, public spaces can be grasped simultaneously as a cultural reality and as a historical reality. For instance, the Time Squares in New York besides being a high profile business hub in the day it is the American cultureâs trademark by the famous ritual of the silver ball dropping at the New Yearâs Eve countdown which draws attention from millions of international tourists every year.  \n\nOn the other hand, I believe that there are several aspects that must be considered despite many advantages. The first one is that governments need to keep the land fund for social welfare construction due to the overpopulation in the world. The high rate of population density provokes the high demands and burdens to the governments in terms of residences and service public infrastructures such as hospitals and schools. Another drawback is the existence of a disruptive development that belongs to the development of technology in many countries. People have other ways of relaxing and entertaining themselves by watching video clips or surfing the Internet instead of doing exercises or joining community activities that take place in public areas.\n\nIn conclusion, although the benefits associated with public places are important, the need for such places also depends on each circumstance and must be adapted to the lifestyle of residential communities so as not to wasteland resources.",

    "essay": "Establishing a large public place outdoors such as parks and town squares seems only reasonable for those wealthier municipalities able to upgrade their image, but such a proposal in my opinion might not be applicable to other cities and towns. This essay will present some reasons to support my argument. \n\nOne of the main ideas that some towns believe building such grand public spaces is for the pursuit of tourism. The city planners, often at the behest of developers and greedy construction interests will attempt to invest in these improvement schemes in the hopes of luring visitors and potential new residents. This often seems to be a shortsighted choice for imaginary economics with no guarantee that out of town visitors will in fact come and see the finish project. Granted, there may also be some minor benefits for local residents such as being able to practice in an expansive area and being able to socialize in a varied context in terms of new acquaintances in an open environment. Truthfully, most of these places are often abandoned and neglected. \n\nNext not all towns and cities are capable of transforming their public areas into such massive single use developments. To be more specific, the cost of establishing a gigantic public space is high. While local governments should consider the potential revenue from tourism, ultimately they need to focus on staying within their budgets for any public project. If the investment is far more than what could be afforded, then creating a huge garden or public square of some kind would only end up as an unfinished project. This came at the cost of rooting up many of the older residents at a higher payout from the taxpayers and left many of the plans on the drawing board as the majority of these construction plots simply ran out of city financing to be completed. \n\nIn conclusion, I would continue to argue that this desire to improve a town or city by building a large public square or park may in fact be much more costly than expected compared to the little return in potential tourist revenue simply because the tourism market has shifted and these old ways of attracting people to a city are no longer valid.",

    "essay": "In contemporary society, there is a sense of discomfort about the way the articles convey the affluentâs private lives in the entertainment industry. While many individuals suppose that these individuals should accept that due to their considerable fame, I hold the opposite viewpoint.\n\nIt is undeniable that some individuals who work as celebrities, such as actors, models, etc., suffer from the pressure of society on their professional and personal lifestyles. The media enterprises do this to obtain more notoriety and ratings for their prestigious companies. Therefore, they frequently invade their privacy by highlighting terrible circumstances in front of the public, which is considered a disgraceful act. For example, Nguyen Thuc Thuy Tien, Miss Grand International 2021, was sued by another woman about the non-payment of a debt. This will have a detrimental impact on her reputation and credibility.\n\nMoreover, I believe that each resident has their own privacy because every person is a separate individual. Thus, the unduplicated individual has the right to live and do everything they enjoy without breaking the law. Not to mention their significant contributions to the development of society as a whole as well as international contributions, especially in the entertainment industry. For example, actor Tran Thanh, the films he has made have made great contributions to Vietnam's cinema, not only attracting the attention of domestic but also international audiences. Consequently, he can use the revenue to do charitable activities and assist the poor with problems they have encountered in their lives.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that should respect and understand that everyone, including celebrities, is entitled to privacy and personal space. They, too, have the independence of keeping their secrets to themselves. Hence, the media should refrain from prying into celebritiesâ personal lives.",

    "essay": "These days, the media intrusion of celebritiesâ privacy is becoming more popular in some parts of the world. It is argued by some that famous people have to embrace this trend as a price for their fame. However, in my opinion, I totally disagree with this view on account of some reasons below.\n\nThere are many reasons why I strongly believe that it is unjustifiable for the private lives of well-known people to be widely publicized through means of mass media. First of all, the privacy of personal information should be respected as a human right regardless of who they are. Celebrities are also humans, and they should have their own life or their own freedom. Secondly, when the private lives of influential people appear on social media, this can somehow cause some controversy among some groups of people. In fact, some anti-fans or uncivil people can unconsciously post some negative comments which make loyal fans become angry. This would be worse if those people have heated debates and intentional insulation, which leads to utter chaos in society to some extent.\n\nSome people hold an argument that the loss of privacy is an unavoidable part of becoming a famous celebrity. This is because human beings are undoubtedly a curious species, and headlines about well-known starsâ private lives can catch the attention of many viewers, making the publicity of celebrities become greater at the same time. Having said that, I still argue that the personal lives of famous people should not be published in the media due to tremendous negative effects on their mental health. To be more specific, being famous stars can be pressured and stressful since they always have to worry about othersâ opinions or be careful in every action when the paparazzi can follow them at any time. For instance, many K-pop stars cannot put up with criticism of Internet users when their private lives are reported on articles, leading them to depression or even suicide.\n\nIn conclusion, because of the aforementioned reasons  in terms of human rights and detrimental effects on celebritiesâ mental well-being in particular and society in general, I disagree with the view that famous people should accept privacy invasion as a part of their reputation.",

    "essay": "In a modern and high-tech society, some universities and colleges choose online classes as a substitution for face-to-face courses, which has both advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will discuss both positive and negative aspects. \n\nTo begin with, there is no doubt that with online courses, students are allowed to study at home or wherever they feel comfortable and suitable. It is easy to attend in virtual classrooms  their technology devices with a strong internet connection anywhere in the world. For instance, some prestigious universities, including Harvard University, and Cambridge University have online courses, both free and pay fees, in many fields. They also provide specific curriculums and learning paths. Not only the convenience but also students are possible to save time on transport when participating in online classes. Besides, the availability of online learning tools can promote students' independent learning. It creates good habits and motivates students, especially freshmen, to feel familiar with self-study - a popular learning method in tertiary education. \n\nIn contrast, online learning might not offer learners face-to-face interaction. Firstly, students might find it uninteresting when experiencing a lack of interaction and engagement because of the limitation in providing activities or group work. Consequently, students can easily lose their concentration on the lessons and the effectiveness of their learning is decreased. With classes on campus, the more activities can be created in class, the more attention of students have and also more learning efficiency. Secondly, with some professional or key courses, teaching and learning online might not deliver full knowledge. Students become more passive when attending virtual classrooms and then receive the basic and fundamental, not acquire the core knowledge abundantly. Lecturers or teachers also might find it difficult to deliver the lessons and interact with students. As a result, students will not have a good day learning, and lecturers will work unproductively.\n\nTo sum up, online learning has pros and cons. Universities and colleges should balance between two kinds of classrooms to offer learners flexible learning opportunities, which one they feel is beneficial and convenient.",

From my perspective, although this idea has its particular downsides,  Iâm still more inclined towards the benefits that it brings.\n\n           One of the undeniable advantages of this online learning is that students from anywhere can now gain access to tertiary educationâs lectures anywhere and anytime they want.  For example, a person from India in a modern world like today can easily enter an online learning course of a renowned university even though he is not abroad. In addition, videos in online learning courses also allow students to replay the parts where they do not understand, which a person can not do if he is joining a face-to-face learning classroom. \n\n           Next, with more and more cutting-edge technology over the years and Internet-based applications today such as Skype and Messenger, a person can easily get support from his peers or teachers through chatting via mobile apps or emailing regardless of no face-to-face interaction. For instance, if a student joins in a direct learning classroom, he might have to keep quiet to the end of the class to not bother people around even though he has questions he wants to ask, but that would not be a problem to online learning in general and communicating via Internet-based applications in specific.\n\n           In conclusion, even though online courses may still be a novel experience for universities students, they offer various merits.

    "essay": "Having a healthy way of living indeed plays an integral role in a happy society. Because of this, allotting public money to promote a salubrious lifestyle has always been a topic of public interest and has a remarkable ability to alleviate severe health issues. However, some people argue that time and general finance should be diverted to cure ill patients which directly benefits human health. While this thinking is somewhat justifiable, I would contend that it is the interest of humankind to put more effort into boosting balanced nutrition for citizens generally.\n\n \n\nIt is understandable why some people think that it is essential to protect public health, which is absolutely in dire need of community funding. First and foremost, advocates may argue that according to a hectic pace of life, individuals are more inclined to consume unhealthy food and rarely spend their time cooking nutritious meals. This trend is followed by those devoting their whole time to earning their living. Therefore, eating fast food becomes their priority choice, leading them to live a sedentary lifestyle with obesity and also diabetes. As a result, the government has to pay attention to tackle this terrible tendency by providing more information about health issues and disease prevention campaigns. Forbidding junk food restaurants is a telling example, the authorities should establish more local markets where selling a variety of packed fresh meals is synonymous with an affordable price. This is a compelling testament to encouraging busy individuals to consume more good food.\n\n \n\nNevertheless, there is indeed a necessity to treat people suffering from a severe health cognitive. I believe it would be unwise to ignore the unshaken importance of this point. In fact, due to the lack of financially viability, many people who live in underprivileged areas do not have sufficient opportunities to cure their disease. They are in dire need of financial support. This means that instead of spending big bucks on other things, public money should be invested in saving human life. Additionally, a host of dangerous epidemics such as ebola and coronavirus may stand a chance of spreading and destroying peoples lives. Consequently, almost all the countries in the world must pay attention to prevent these circumstances by using national funds to support a compulsory, free vaccination for their citizens.\n\n \n\nIn conclusion, it seems better to use federal finance to raise the widespread concern about a healthy lifestyle. I am convinced that infectious disease outbreaks will have a toll on economic prosperity if the authorities misspend to protect their ill inhabitants.",

    "essay": "Governments around the world incur taxes from their citizens to develop the country in several sectors, such as infrastructure, transport, education and medical facilities. It has been vastly developed in a couple of decades, such as high-speed transport to move goods fast, R&D investment for educational purposes and multi-storey buildings. As in the case of medical facilities, it is hard to predict the future and even a virus spread could cause collateral damage to the country. A proactive nation would get less impact, by guide their citizens to lead a healthy lifestyle. We can have a discussion on how a nation could be impacted by a proactive and reactive behaviour.\n\nFirst and foremost, public money needs to be spent in a logical way, such as promoting a healthy lifestyle by constructing parks and encourage cycling by a separate lane. For example, England has a cycle lane on its most of the road to engage the people. Secondly, consumption of fast food has to be less promoted, such as advertisements and hoardings. These ad attracts the people's interest, rather than the taste. At last, encourage proper diet would effectively create a healthy life and it would help governments, not to push the major share of its income to treat the ill people.",

    "essay": "Bombarding of adverts on various types of products, undoubtedly, has increased significantly in this contemporary era. Owing to this, thinking of individuals on this play a crucial role as well as it has negatively influenced human's lives.  I discord with this assertion up to a higher extent and pertinent notions will explicate it further.\n\nCommencing with pre-eminent unfavourable aspects. The former viable anatomy is , effect on the buying decision of consumers. To elaborate  more, when various ads are observed by them on distinct platforms whether social media or television or newspaper, they purchased unwanted things, which leads to wastage of hard-earned money. To exemplify, it can be seen in real life, brands hire  eminent celebrities to endorse products to allure the views. In addition, the promotion of unacceptable commodities can be heinous to people. Since certain firms sponsor their food items like protein supplements, even alcohol and tobacco by using attractive ways, the more viewers consume these products, the more they suffer in terms of health.\n\nOn the other hand, increasing awareness about products and services among commoners. As people obtain knowledge about the plenty of features whether choices, prices, qualities of any services by seeing the ads plus it is beneficial for sellers for marketing their products which eventually act as a win-win situation for both. To illustrate, every kind of organisation either small or large scale displays adverts to generate awareness about their commodities among various users.\n\nIn conclusion, albeit knowing the products' bad and good things from ads is imperative, manipulation of mindset and having badly influenced by billboards is far more not fruitful for the society and communities in leading a healthy lifestyle.",

    "essay": "It is unequivocal that people hold different views about the means of getting the news. Although some people maintain that newspapers are the best way to learn news, I hold a belief that  people can learn news better through other types of media since these methods are easily accessible and more economical compared to the conventional newspaper. \n\nAdmittedly, there are some rationales why people believe that newspapers are the best way to learn the news. Chief among these is that reading newspaper has high levels of accuracy because it is strictly censored by the state. One of the most appealing illustrations is  Thanh Nien newspapers which provides a host of thoughtful topics so many people enjoy reading this newpaper. Added to this, when you learn news by newspapers, you can practice concentration skills, while other types of media can make them distracted, they are not focused on the topics. Moreover, this can make us practice more reading skills, some people are not good at technology so it is hard for them to choose suitable sites to read news.\n\nNotwithstanding the above-mentioned justifications, I still gravitate towards the view that people can learn news better through other media. one of the most compelling reasons is that, when we learn new through other types of media, it will be more diverse in topics. it bears witness to foreign news, we can get high-accuracy information, these are easily accessible and more economical compared to conventional newspapers. to add further credence to my assertion. all types of media are  free, we can be read easily with the click of a button. it brings convenience for people.\n\nIn conclusion, although there is no doubt that reading newspapers is still a ubiquitous type of getting informed, reading news types of other media is the best way to learn news in the modern times",

    "essay": "In the world of growing advanced technology, the role of newspapers as the best means of transferring information has provoked considerable controversy. While some people still support this opinion, others have found other media more useful to obtain information. thus, this essay is going to weigh up the pros and cons of both sides, then showing my perspectives on the matter.\n\nTo begin with, there is no room for doubt that newspapers have long been a widely popular news channel for their reliability. The information in the newspaper is likely to be verified carefully before being published so as to minimize the risk of faulty news that would possibly ruin the reputation of the publishers. The checking process with various steps and people involved will investigate the authenticity of sources of news, the writing style of articles, relevant illustrative images and so on. thus, it may take more time, making newspaper less up-to-date than other digital media, which can immediately spread news when they happen.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many other types of media emerging in  modern life, especially, social media, which are claimed to be the fastest-growing in popularity. Since social networking sites are sharing platforms, users can post any news they encounter in their daily life at the click of the mouse, thus making social media a fertile source of news. due to their ease to use, the news can be spread easily and widely at an astonishing speed. For example, Facebook is now becoming one of the most effective ways to get information thanks to its billions of users, or in other words, billions of amateur âjournalistsâ. However, due to the lack of verification, the news on social media may be manipulated for several personal benefits. More seriously, some distorted news can even trigger adverse effects or great losses to  society.\n\nBy considering both views, it is reasonable to state that every media has its own advantages and disadvantages. thus, from my point of view, news learners should smartly utilize all media at their disposal by making the best use of the strong points and overcoming the drawbacks of each channel. For example, they should use social media to stay updated but still remain conscious by checking the news again in the newspaper to prove its authenticity. By using media effectively, people can obviously become more knowledgeable and up-to-date.",

    "prompt": "In many countries, people are deciding to have children at a later age than in the past. Why? Advantages outweigh disadvantages?",
    "essay": "In these days and ages, in some nations, residents have changed their minds when choosing to have offspring at a later age compared to the past. This essay will find out the reasons and clarify why the drawbacks outweigh the benefits.\n\nFirstly, when life costs increase, people decide to shift their priority from starting a family to establishing financial security which helps them to pay off basic needs including housing, food, transportation and healthcare services. Secondly, whereas women in the past were attributed as ones taking on roles of giving birth at the âright ageâ, this perception now has changed. In other words, females opt to pursue their careers, and personal goals and seek gender equality leading to a delay in starting a family. For example, a study conducted by the Demographic paper revealed that 7 in 10 women aged 30 â 35 said that they would not be ready to become moms unless they achieved their professional aspirations.\n\nDespite the aforementioned grounds, it is undeniable that raising children at a later age has some disadvantages excelling advantages. On the one hand, having offspring when getting older that individuals achieve financial stability and a strong financial foundation facilitating them to create a better environment for adolescentsâ development and growth. It means that, their babies can join private schools with advanced education systems, resulting in positive performance which contributes to a qualified national workforce. On the other hand, giving birth late might cause some consequences related to childrenâs physical and mental health. Furthermore, it may result in a huge generation gap between parents and their sons or daughters, who are prone to be influenced by outside factors such as social media. As a result, parents need to talk to them regularly to provide appropriate guidance and advice helping to steer them from negative factors which older parents might struggle to solve.\n\nIn conclusion, although selecting to have offspring at a later stage in life is based on reasonable factors such as establishing strong financial backgrounds, it has some detrimental effects on childrenâs lives which outweigh the positive aspects. It is predicted that if governments have appropriate assistance in raising children, communities will re-consider giving birth at a more suitable age due to the decrease in childcare burdens.",

    "essay": "In todayâs world, having children at older ages has become increasingly popular in recent years. Although this can have certain demerits, it is my firm belief that the merits of having children later in life are more considerable.\n\nOn the one hand, there are some drawbacks when having children at older ages. One of the most significant negative impacts is that it may create a generation gap. This is mainly because parents may be too old when their first child enters puberty, which is when there is a great change in their attitude. As a result, there may be a lack of mutual understanding between the parents and the children. Another negative effect is that having children at older ages may lead to an ageing population. As a consequence, senior citizens may have to work full-time even though they are too old to work. For example, in Japan, one of the countries with the highest ageing population rate in the world, the government has increased the retirement age from 60 to 65.\n\nOn the other hand, I personally believe that the benefits of having children later in life are more significant. To begin with, parents can choose the most appropriate educational style for their children. The main reason is that before having children, people have enough time to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of parenting methods. Also, many parents may observe and receive advice from friends, their parents and other experienced people, so this may help them become wise parents. Moreover, people may have the financial ability to raise their children. As a result, the children can fully develop intellectually and healthily. For instance, in recent years many parents have babies at a time when they did not have enough finances so their children may not receive the best benefits. \n\nIn conclusion, while there are certain downsides of having children later regarding the generation gap between parents and their children and an ageing population, I am firmly convinced that the upsides in terms of being able to choose the most appropriate educational style and having the financial ability are weightier.",

    "essay": "The age difference between parents and their children has been a topic of debate. Some argue that greater differences in age can be more beneficial than smaller ones. In this essay, we will examine the advantages and disadvantages of varying age gaps between parents and children and discuss whether the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.\n\nOne potential advantage of a greater age difference between parents and children is the wealth of experience and wisdom that older parents bring to their child's upbringing. They may have a more stable financial situation and be better prepared for the responsibilities of parenthood. This can create a secure and nurturing environment for the child's development.\n\nFurthermore, older parents may have a more patient and understanding approach to parenting, which can contribute to a child's emotional well-being. The experience gained over the years can help them make informed decisions and offer valuable guidance.\n\nHowever, there are also disadvantages to consider. A significant age gap can result in a generation gap, leading to potential differences in values, beliefs, and interests. Communication may become challenging, as the generations may struggle to relate to each other.\n\nIn conclusion, while greater age differences between parents and children can offer some advantages in terms of experience and stability, the disadvantages related to potential generation gaps and health issues should not be overlooked. Whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages largely depends on individual circumstances. Effective communication, understanding, and support within the family can mitigate many of the challenges associated with age differences between parents and children.",

For example. I know a couple who gave birth at around 35/37 yrs, the wife graduated as an accountant from a renowned University in Nigeria and the husband an Engineer from a renowned University in Nigeria as well, they have both got good job and are living fine before they eventually got married and they got pregnant bought beautiful baby things that I love when I visited them during their child naming ceremony. \n\nThey are both mature enough to cater for the needs of their baby and by so doing the mother was able to eat adequate diet which helped the baby to grow well during pregnancy and after delivery, the baby will suck well due to the good food the mother eat. The couple will be able to give the children good education due to their employment. \n\nNevertheless, having children at older age comes with some complications which includes menopause for the mother. A woman who got married at 40 might not be privileged to have more than one child due to menopause, moreover the child during pregnancy is subjected to chromosomal abnormalities, also late pregnancy leads to eclampsia due to rise in blood pressure which can lead to growth retardation for the fetus during pregnancy.

There are some medical conditions that may be complicated by late pregnancy and besides the woman is expected to attain menopause at a time in her life.\n\nTo begin with, ageing process is associated with westing and tearing of the body which predisposes the body system to certain disease conditions. Similarly, pregnancy involves both physical and hormonal changes. Conditions like hypertension in older people are likely to be more serious with pregnancy resulting in preeclamptic toxaemia which can risk losing the mother, child or both during pregnancy, labour or delivery. Furthermore, the offspring can be born with congenital abnormality which may result from degenerative conditions in the parents genes.

One of the major reasons is that kids will live  or stay with their parents as they are growing old. People believe that it erases loneliness ,  having a full house or a big family and coupling with someone that will take care of them at this stage of their growth.\n\nIn addition,in some developing countries that use manual labour for farming, they believe that the larger the family, the more the workforce.

Although, this will make one to be knowledgeable about two people coming together as one and  be ready to bear any consequences that might arise. But, having the chance of being pregnant and giving delivery without complication is more beneficial. This essay will be explained further in the subsequent paragraphs with examples and a logical conclusion drawn.\n\nFirstly, getting to have offspring in the  later years makes one  have adequate knowledge about the  kids and the process involved thereby getting ready to carter any issue that might arise. For instance, a neighbour of mine once told me that she faced a lot of challenges when she was in the early stage of her pregnancy from her friends and her spouse's friends. She was able to conquer the obstacles because she attended awaiting mother's seminar for 5 months which resulted in her lateness to bear issues. In addition, being mature before one starts giving childbirth will allow the person to be ready to bear any concerns in the long run. \n\nHowever, female folks' tendency of getting pregnant in advance period is limited. This is because the hormonal cycle terminates as one is getting older. For instance, my friend that joined her partner 5 years ago is still battling to  miss her period due to an imbalance of hormones which resulted in infertility.

Clearly, academic staff in many countries, who have their first baby when they are 35-40 years old, can afford what children need such as living costs, education, health, and so on. Hence, no doubt why people who are older ages just have their first children.\n\nThe consequence of this phenomenon is that social problems caused by children decrease such as any kind of crime. It is because children grow up with quality. They are able to be teachers, doctors, businessmen, scientists, and so, having the knowledge to think, analyze, and distinguish whatever problems that they have faced.

However, I believe that a greater age difference betwen the kids and elders have way more drawbacks than its positive aspects. I will explain how it affects relations and how it is good for children's learning.\n\nTo start with, the generation gap plays a significant role in holding families together. The mentality and lifestyle of the people change as per time and if there is more difference of it in generations, then the relationships will become more hard to remain stable. Thus, it results in splitting families apart. For example, in our neighborhood, there are old parents who has their offsprings quite younger and they could not coupe up with the way their children living. Therefore, all of their children left them alone. Inspite of this, if the age variance is less, then the families will be expected to have healthy relations and better understanding.\n\nHowever, a small difference in the age of elder and younger ones in families incredibly help the children excel in their academic and professional careers. To explain further, a person's knowledge and experience should be up-to-date in this advanced technology era and if the parents are not too older their kids, then it becomes obvious that they will assist to compete in the face-paced world. For instance, younger couples are nowadays focusing on teaching their children about the computer and technology by being their mentors. \n\nTo conclude, the large generation gap sometimes becomes hindrance in the child'd journey to success in terms of not supporting their ideas. The age-gap plays a major role in defining the strength of relationships among the family and the exposure of the children. As mentioned above, less the difference, more is the understanding and affection between adults and youngsters.

In my view, a greater  gap generation has more benefits.\n\nOn the one hand,  a long gap generation between children and parents can have some advantages. First, parents usually are more experienced and knowledgeable. Thus, it is unlikely to make wrong decisions about their children's affairs. For example, when it comes to a university major, they try to guide them based on their experience rather than emotions. Secondly, most older parents do not struggle with financial issues, and they can afford their children easily. Their children usually enjoy a high standard of living like  convenient holidays and high-quality educational facilities.\n\nOn the other hand, younger parents have more energy to deal with their children.  In other words, they can play  adventurous games or extreme sports with them like windsurfing because they are at the age that they usually are braver and healthy mentally and physically.

This essay will discuss both the gains and losses of giving birth at a later age.\n\nFirstly, becoming parents at the elder stage has the privilege of having extra span to provide abundance to their coming child. In the current situation where there is a constant rise in the costs and education, it is very hard to think about having a kid. From 25 to 30 period of soul, the public struggles for their career and settlement with a good amount of earnings. For instance, a student who just passed out with his doctorate degree at the year of 29 and gets married at the youth of 31 has very little time to settle in his career and go for family planning. Thus, few parents are inclined towards having a juvenile after 35 life span of maturity and can give a better environment to the born minor.\n\nConversely, this could also cause health issues to reproduce after 32 years of lifetime. Growth after the thirties requires  taking care of the body as it becomes weak as compared to the below thirty years period. In this case, it could lead to weak reproduction strength in a person. To prove this, there are a lot of IVF and test tube baby centres available for such married couples. Therefore, it is advised by the senior citizens in  society to have a youngster soon after the wedding to avoid such fitness problems later.\n\nIn conclusion, babymaking at above 32 years of duration has both merits and demerits. However, giving birth to the baby at youth surely surpasses the possibility of abnormal well-being in reproduction.",

    "essay": "The modern society has seen a declined willing of young people to have a baby. Distinguised from their parent and grandparent generation, they tend to postpone their plans for a kid. However, overall this phenominon brings young people more advantages than disadvantages. In this article, I will first analyse why young population choose to have kids late nowadays and then explain why the pros outweigh the cons.\n\nNot only haven't they prepared well mentally, the practcal issues such as lacking of money and stemina are also their obstables to have children at their early ages. On the one hand, many people claim that they are resistent to being pregnant and raising a kid is that they do not like kids, and they attribute this mindset to their childhood experience such as bullie and their parents' failed marige. On the other hand, there is a group of young people who love kids but blocked by material factors like money and time. People at their 20s or 30s have exceedingly heavey financial burdern and workload, and are unlikely to spend time to look after a single baby,  not to mention 2 or more. Therefore, people tend to have children late than before due to their peasonal experience or the burdern. \n\nDespite of the fact that having baby late has become a new normal choice amoung the new generation, the mirits surpass the demirits given that the contenmporay society has changed. First, the young people gain more time to the career development since they don't need to spend many years accompanying an infant. Second, following their free mind and personal choice can make them fell less stressed and more peace. Admittedly, they may regret in the future or feel bothered by the social or peer presure, they can have remedies such as adopt a kid. \n\nTo summarize, in general, the generation tend to be in favor of the late birth due to mental obstables or practical issues. However, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.",

For the country, it is not good static, because the scion are workers in the future. For example, China faced this problem. If early they were a policy about one child to one family. Today, they see that the number of middle age (workers society) is less than 10 years ago. To link with this, they declined that policy \"one family one child\". They have a new policy, which permits to family to have three children.\n\nOn the other hand, from the pointed example, it can see that Chinese people do not have more children already. They explained their deserve do not want children, of the material conditions. To contain heir is expensive. They have to buy them more things, bringing up, including attending various courses of development. Chinese people, such as more population in Europe and USA want to live for themselves.

    "essay": "Over the last two or three decades, late marriage has been raising tremendously than ever before; as a result, parents and children have a huge ade difference. However, some think that a huge age difference between parents and kids is more adavandages rather than a minimum age difference. I think this trend has more drawbacks than benefits, this essay discusses it briefly for the following reasons. \n\nTo begin wiht, a huge age difference between fathers and mothers and kids have more disadvantages. Firstly, this can lead to being a generation gap between them; thus, mutual understanding might be missed betwen them. Secondly, these kind of parents will be old when theirs' children will be enter in teenage; thus, sometimes they cannot live more years with theirs' infants due to elder diseases. In addition, after one certain age, children look after theirs' parents when infants be in teenage, and therefore, infants cannot be delighted to theirs' life. For example, in the western nations people marry after fourty. Thus, many children live with single parent mother or father due to elder age diseases affect theirs' parents. Therefore, this trend gives more disadvantages. \n\nOn the other hand, a huge age difference has some benefits for both fathers and infants. First, parents have more assets because they save more money for theirs' future after got married; thus, financial burdens do not disturb theirs' life. Second, parents and children have a mutual relationship maintain because parents have more maturity, and therefore, they can effortlessely understand about theirs' little buds needs and wants. For instance, in Indian also have a huge age difference between theirs' little ones, but they can live a happy life rather than a minimum age difference families. Hence, this situation has some benefits. \n\nTo conclude, a great age gap between parents and toddlers can lead to getting misunderstanding and children cannot live happy in their teenage; they have more financial assests and maintain good reltionship between them. Therefore, I think this process has more disadvantages than advantages.",

    "essay": "Certain audiences think, that a huge gap between the parents and the children is good as it has more benefits for an infant. However, some people believe there should be fewer life differences. In my perception, cons are greater than pros. Firstly, I will explain some positive points of this trend, secondly, I will discuss the negatives at the end.\n\nTo begin with, the biggest advantage a couple will get is, more time to plan for a child and enjoy their life without any responsibilities or liabilities. As a result, this can help them to earn enough money and resources for the overall development of a child. Newlywed couples, for instance, give their initial 3-4 years time for their relationship, and simultaneously, they plan everything, from kinder garden school to college finances, before starting a family.\n\nOn the other hand, parents of the later maturity will reduce their involvement with their offspring. Moreover, a gigantic void may result in different ideas altogether. For example, health issues may be a factor for not engaging enough with the kid . In addition, a huge generation gap may affect the understanding between the parents and the children with the current trend. This will severely impact the education and cognitive skill of a kid, which may lead to improper development.\n\nIn conclusion, if there is not much generation gap between the parents and the children, they can understand the current education trend and involve better for their child growth. While  parents can arrange finances, it may hamper the child's growth drastically. In my opinion, I think that  the advantages are not enough compared to the disadvantages, people should start a family as soon as possible.",

    "essay": "Yes, I am of the opinion that having a large age difference between parents and their kids can be advantageous for better upbringing as having more years on their side makes individual mature and balance. Firstly, this essay will discuss the advantages of this approach and then I will present to you my opinion on why the drawbacks hold little significance.\n\nNowadays, the age gap between parents and kids is generally more than the previous times. One of the main reason people cited  is the maturity involved in nurturing the offspring. Parents need to be matured enough to handle the responsibility of providing ahealthy lifestyle to kids, and this is the core reason why some people chose to delay the decision of having babies. Another considerable reason is making younger ones aware of what is right and what is wrong. Elders personal life experiences help them in teaching children about moral and ethical values. To exemplify, teaching a child about the importance of positive attitude, good behaviour and character.\n\nHowever, the only side effect of having a big age difference is its impact on the emotional strength of parents. As mother and father grow old early they are not considered compatible enough to match with the social life of youngsters. However, this bigger age factor phenomenon has a positive side like parents can provide financial stability to the upcoming generation, which is imperative to survive in the 21st century. For example, business setups by our father help us in paying lakhs of tuition fees to pursue higher education overseas to have a glorious future.\n\nIn conclusion, apart from a few demerits,I promote the notion of having a maximum age difference between elders and children in order to assist upcoming generation with the quality approach towards both practical and personal life.",

    "essay": "It is often argued that the youth gap between parents and children should be more. As it has more benefits for an infant. However, some people believe there should be a less life difference. In my perception, cons are greater than pros. Firstly, I will explain some positive points of this trend, secondly, I will discuss the negatives at the end.\n\nTo begin with, one of the biggest advantages is that a couple can explore their life with any responsibilities or liabilities. Moreover, these days parents are much educated and they can understand their children easily. As a result, children get more attached to the parents and share everything with them. The relationship gets stronger and parents can guide children in the right way by easily mingling with them. For example, parents will be able to understand what the latest technology is and try to provide that for their child.\n\nOn the other hand, parents of the later maturity will reduce their involvement with their children. Because parents with more youth variation are physically inactive with a child. For instance, people of higher old age usually have more health issues. Consequently, children have the same health problems genetically. Being a parent in the early part of marriage can make their busy life and they will not have time to roam around and be with each other.\n\nFurthermore, it is quite possible that their children will not be able to support them at the time of their financial need at an older maturity.They become old when their children are young and hence they miss the opportunity of playing with them.\n\nIn conclusion, if there is not much generation gap between parents and children they can understand the current education trend and guide their children accordingly and also play with them and enjoy. So, I believe it is beneficial for a child if there is not much maturity difference between them.",

    "essay": "Nowadays the percentage of people, which want to have a child in their middle age is rising. This essay will discuss the reasons why it occurs and will provide arguments for its advantages and disadvantages.\nIn my opinion the rise in the rate of people, who decided to have children in their later age than in the past is due to reason: desire to build stronger financial bases for future family. More young people realize that to carry about children and provide them with all necessary needs are not cheap and all this thing requires a sustainable financial source. That is why a lot of people try firstly to build a successful career, which results in forming a strong financial basement and only after that to plan a child. For example, a lot of Russian survey's results demonstrate that the lack of enough money is the main reason of delaying of planning children. \nThere are advantages and disadvantages of this statement. From one point of view, it is better to have a child in more wealthy conditions because all our and child's demand would be satisfied. For instance, to take care of children and provide them with a quality access to all necessary services, which impact on their development, require a lot of financial investments. \nOn the other hand it is bad to have children in later age because of physical opportunities  for mothers. Childbirth is a strong stress on women's health and according to evolution from year to year women's body does not become younger and stronger for bringing a birth of a baby. For instance, there are many cases when children of middle aged women were born with some physical disabilities. \nIn my personal opinion, advantages of late planning kid outweigh disadvantages due to modern human demands. Moreover, medicine's achievements allow women to solve their physical problems. \nSummarizing the ideas mentioned above it has become clear that there are advantages and disadvantages of late planning children  and the main reason of this is desired to make a confident financial base.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, more and more people prefer to have kids late. The main reason is that they want to spend more time on their careers as well as their personal experiences. Personally, I believe that this lifestyle brings more benefits that drawbacks.\nThe reason why the proportion of people who are having this lifestyle are getting larger is that it has numerous favourable aspects. First, people want to have chances to gain more personal experiences. In other words, they can have more years of freedom for their own pleasures. For example, they can travel around the globe to see breathtaking landscapes, to meet people from different cultures. They can also learn new skills such as flying a helicopter. This can help them find new hobbies and maybe even explore their hidden talents. Second, this lifestyle gives people a larger opportunity to focus on their career. They can save their time, effort and resources and allocate them to their career. To illustrate, people that have not had children can save a huge proportion of their income and therefore, they can use that to invest in a profitable project and generate more incomes. As a result, the benefits of having children in the later age are vast.\nNevertheless, if people hesitate about having children for too long, that can have negative impacts to their life. One of the effects is about health conditions. This means that when they finally decide to have kids, their bodies may not be healthy enough for giving birth. Researches have shown that women over 35 have higher possibilities to give birth to babies with Down syndrome. In addition, it is harder for men over 40 to have a successful fertilization.\nIn my opinion, despite its negative impacts, the benefits it brings are more valuable and worth trying. People should spend their youth on chasing their dreams and thinking big, as long as they settle down soon enough to be still healthy enough for babies, which is before 35 years old for women and before 40 years old for men.\nIn conclusion, it is more common now to have kids in the later age. This can have both advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I suggest that people should spend their youth on their career and personal experience.",

    "essay": "In today's world, more people are inclined towards their career than family, which was not same few decades back. Making children in those times were considered a big issue and very important to lead a happy life. This mindset has changed to a huge extent. Although it still remains an important aspect, but it is not the only way to be successful. This essay would give valid reasons to support the advantages of planning children at a later age.\n\nTo begin with, people who are educated and well established can take the responsibility of guiding their children sensibly and also provide the financial support to them. They have enough experience which could be useful for their offsprings to have an easy and comfortable livelihood. Unlike children who face day-to-day problems, including financial, health and social. They are the product of very irresponsible parents who did not think about the consequences of their wrong decision. These parents usually are in their 20's and are trying to achieve success in their career by spending long periods at work and almost no time with their family. On the other hand, a couple who plans to have children once they are settled do justice to them by striking a perfect work-life balance.\n\nAnother benefit of pushing this decision is creating ample space and time for one's self to pursue the career they want. To add to this, let's take an example of a successful person, Steve Jobs, he became popular during 1970's when he with his business partner ruled the technology market for many decades. He had his first child in late 1990's when he had already achieved a mark which everyone today dreams of. It's about focus and determination which gets affected if there is a family who needs an equal attention, hence it becomes extremely difficult to succeed with so much to handle.\n\nTo summarize, a child should not have a childhood full of worries,struggle and tensions because they were brought into this world by some irresponsible parent, instead they should cherish each and every moment of their life. Couples who are ready to enjoy parenthood and give their child a blissful life should be encouraged for taking a wise decision.",

I firlmly agree that the easiest way of teaching children to cooperate is through team sports at school.\n\nFirst and foremost argument is that the children must have leaned to cooperate in common. This can be easily taught in their schools itself because that is the place where they can learn everything without any hesitation and by the easiest way of through the sports team. By playing in a sports team at school they can easily indulge with other folks.\n\nFor instance, any aspects like sports or other activities in school they include the activities like cooperation, management, etc., . By playing in sports team they may learn something about the cooperation wisely.\n\nBy agreeing that the best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school.

By replacing him the sports team can get constant play . But the person who is going to replace is so important there we see an better cooperation to run a sports team.

    "essay": "Some parents or teachers believe that the most effective way for their children to learn how to cooperate with another person is to engage them in team sports at school or attend more team sports activities. In my opinion, I completely agree with the idea and will outline several reasons following in this essay.\n\nFirstly, participating in team sports at school helps children to improve their communication skills, which is essential for effective cooperation. When children attend team sports, whether it be basketball, football, or volleyball require communication with each other players, that occasion let them aware of how communication skills important because it is the only way to success in the match, they will learn more and more different features that can be used in their conversation through verbal communication, hand signals, body language, or other forms of communication, and by regularly practicing the many forms of communication involved in playing team sports, children are improving their communication skills steadily and they will feel more confident and simply when they need to cooperate with another one in class.\n\nSecondly, when children take part in team sports at school, they will have more opportunities to exactly know what cooperation means, to learn and explore more effective methods to reach the common goal, which is basic and defined as cooperation. Playing team sports, children are forced to learn how to work together politically and kindly, take me as an example, I am in my school's basketball team, and our coach is extremely focused on drills that train us how to execute certain strategies that require us to cooperate with another member, and by doing so, that let me have recognition and experience the benefits of working together firsthand, which make me a desire and enthusiasm to cooperate with others because by doing so, we will be better and have a sense of belonging.\n\nIn conclusion, team sports help students improve their ability to communicate skills and allow them to experience the benefits of cooperating for the first time, which will inspire them and motivate them to cooperate better with others in the future.",

I personally do not stand for this assumption since nowadays pupils can easily learn it from movies. Besides, the fact that not every child is eager to do activity that needs physical ability like sports should be considered. \n\nTo begin with, there are plenty of movies which have topics about teamwork and now it is accessible for anyone including children. Besides, they also can learn other soft skill like language without needing a big effort to do it. For instance, an English cartoon movie called Aladin shows how the main actor collaborates with his team to build a castle, and it shows the enjoyment during the process which is also good for children for being calm when it comes to merging with their peers. Therefore, being a cooperative can be done by entertaining them.\n\nOn the same hand, not every children feels comfortable to do an activity related to exercise, and it is non-negligible for parents to support them. According to BBC  this summer, 6 out of 10 pupils do not enjoy activity-related sports and they prefer to spend their time playing dolls, especially for females. Not to mention, playing dolls with peers could also be a potential way to improve their ability in terms of collaborating. Hence, It becomes clear that sports should be an optional way to get those soft skills.\n\nTo sum up, it is clear that the ability of pupils to work with their peers can be improved by watching an educational TV series, and doing certain games with their friends.",

In this essay, I will explain my justification in detail.\n\nAdmittedly, team sports are incredibly effective when it comes to teaching youngters to cooperate with others. Through a competive environment, players can develop problem-solving skills, self-esteem and strategizing. For example, they can recognize the strengths and shortcomings of each teammate which can be used better to compete against their opponents, especially in sports which have more than 5 participants such as football, volleyball and basketball. In addition, team sports provide a working environment where players work together to achieve a common goal. This can be achieved through verbal communication, body languages and hand signals. In other words, regularly participating in team sports enables teenagers to develop their communication skills which are essential to cooperate effectively.\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that cooperation skills can be cultivated by other activities beyond team sports. Firstly, communitive learning strategies, group project, community activities and even creative activities like theatre and music can also provide valuable opportunities for young people to develop their collaboration skills. In fact, these activities promote cooperation and ability to work effectively in a group setting. They encourage youngsters to understand different perspectives, value teamwork and appreciate the benefits of collective effort. Secondly, not only children may be inclined toward or have the opportunity to take part in team sports. Thus, it is crucial to create a range of activities and environments that cater to diverse interest and ability, ensuring that everyone has a chance to develop their cooperation skills.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that team sports can help children to develop their cooperation skills, I believe that this skill be developed through a variety of activities and environments . By providing a balanced approach that contains all activities, we can effectively nuture the value and skills in cooperating among adolescents.",

Some people argue that playing sports with teams is the best way for teenagers to learn how to cooperate with each other. While it is an effective method to accomplish this goal, I believe that there is another way that can offer good practice chances in teamwork.\n\nOn the one hand, we cannot ignore that students can be taught how powerful if the team can work together by composing team competitions in sports lessons. For example, football is a popular sport played with well cooperation and reaction by 11 people. In the team, every single person has his or her individual responsibility to cope with different tasks in a game such as goalkeepers and strikers. teachers can assign suitable positions to every student according to their relatively outstanding ability. By setting well in position, then the team can be run effectively to win the game.\n\nOn the other hand, there is another more practical way for teenagers to learn how important is teamwork. although team sports can offer an opportunity in training team spirit, the experience cannot be applied in daily life. The main point why students should be taught how to cooperate with a team is that it is a crucial skill in this competitive society. I think that an academic team project is relatively effective and realistic  in nurturing children's sense of cooperation. For example, a project, building a robot, can be separated into different states such as writing a proposal, designing the outlooking, buying materials and programming. These steps definitely require well organizational skills and are like a real corporation project. So students not only can learn how to work with others, but also can realize how the real world operates.\n\nIn conclusion, sports can only provide a limited and short-term experience in teamwork. However, a team project can not only train students' team spirit, but also it can let students adapt to the real challenges in this world.",

For example, in volleyball, players are demanded to predict where the ball is flying to while thinking about the strategy of the group and checking where the other players including teammates are at the same time. Moreover, the situation is changing every second.

    "essay": "Some people are of the opinion that the best method for a child to learn about cooperation is by playing team sports at school. Therefore, I completely hold the same view. \n\nTeam sports play a vital role in a childâs learning. It helps children to become diverse as it opens the possibility to discover new talents. Say ,for example, a timid and shy child can learn that he or she may possess the ability of a leader and soon can be utilised for better performance not only in school but as well as in life. In addition, they can also learn how to cope with challenges and face failures with their heads up, without any hard feelings. Through proper guidance, and positive and negative feedback, they can whole-heartedly accept whatever criticisms are thrown at them. Moreover, sportsmanship and fair team play can also be enhanced alongside  cooperation because they can come up and achieve a general goal. \n\nThe personal comfort zone can be expanded as well, by encountering  other people and eventually creating a new set of friends. For instance, a friend who is one call or chat away during times of hardships. By that, they can never feel alone and left out. \n\nIn summary, a childâs cooperative behaviour can be learned through participation in team sports as it can open the possibility for diversity to discover new talents, how to deal with failures and challenges, learn how to play fairly and the importance of sportsmanship. Best of all, they widen their circle of friends inside or outside their safe zone. Therefore, in conclusion, I extremely agree with this opinion.",

    "essay": "Few topics have drawn as much scholarly attention as the importance of teaching cooperation to school children through participation in team sports activities in the school. Although there has been substantial debate on whether this is the best way to inculcate the habit in children or not, I am of the opinion that former proposition has several strong elements that deserve attention. \n\nA number of benefits can be attributed to educating children about cooperation through organizing joint games in educational institutes. On the one hand, having team sports will definitely lead to small disharmony and arguments among the player which if not resolved will result in the defeat of the team. For example, if the team members are not bonded through team spirit, defenders may pass the ball to the wrong member which in turn, may result in the opposite team gaining an advantage over the other team. This will teach the kids to cooperate in future matches to avoid the repetition of the same tale. On the other hand, without team spirit, children are only likely to lack behind in terms of unleashing their full potential.\n\nAdmittedly, it is true that joint competition is the best way to teach cooperation but one must not ignore that there are also other ways for children to learn teamwork other than team sports like allocating joint tasks like cleaning, indulging in group games like puzzles. However, the benefits of these other methods seem to be insignificant against the deluge of benefits associated with team games.\n\nIn conclusion, I would not wish to underestimate the concerns regarding the emphasis on team games rather than other methods of cooperation. Nevertheless, I feel that team games will have a far-reaching impact on the cooperation level, not only in childhood but also in adulthood.",

Although participation in team sports can improve cooperation, I disagree that it is the best way to teach children to cooperate.\n\nTo begin with, fierce competition is also prevalent in school team sports, thus making children less likely a good team player. Students might not cooperate well with their teammates, as they aim to become the best player in the field. Only those with outstanding performance in the match will be admitted to a renowned university. Consequently, team sports might not be the best option to improve cooperation among youngsters. \n\nOn the other hand, class team assignments can teach children to be cooperative members.

    "essay": "Sports are considered to be one of the most effective activities in children's lifestyle as they offer immense benefits to their health and also help in overall personality development. However, it is often discussed if sports are the best technique to introduce a child to a world where being cooperative is an essential part of regular survival in this competitive world. In my opinion, I fully agree that a school can be the best institution where children can be taught collaboration and teamwork by playing sports activities. \n\nChildhood is the most appropriate time when an individual learns life lessons. So, any skill learnt at the school level prepares a student to perform well in real-life situations in future. Talking about a sport like a football, it requires team efforts in order to goal of the counter-party due to which the whole team wins the game at the end. Also, the winning team is given a big trophy and some cash prize. This kind of game makes a child build team spirit as they all work towards the same goal and at the winning stage, they share the prizes between themselves. Such situations make a child more empathetic towards others and develop him to fight big challenges of life with good confidence. \n\nAnother reason why playing sports in school is the best platform for young children to learn collaborative skills is that they often do not encounter situations at their house. Therefore, schools provide a space where kids meet multiple other children with different personalities and end up being friends as they exchange their thoughts and learn about each other's interests. This helps them to grow as a person. On the other hand, when these children compete with each other in the game, they show a team spirit yet play mutually and support one another which makes them realise how combined efforts in any situation can be beneficial.\n\nIn conclusion, it can be said that school sports play an important role in moulding child's nature and teach them critical skills which cannot be taught apart from them. A child learns the value of combined efforts and develops their sharing mindset which is quite less possible to be taught in the home-place other than in schools. Therefore, sports activities offered at educational places must be encouraged by the parents and school staff itself, considering the positive impact it does on the children.",

For example, in the UK, the government gives children a lot of programs to enhance their ability to be cooperative.\n\nDespite this, Sports are helpful for children because they contain many special activities that children can choose from, such as swimming, running, football, etc. In addition, collective activities give individuals a divert technique to recognize the strength of the team.

Many people indicate that it is easy to teach kids teamwork by organizing sports competitions such as football or basketball where children have to play in a team otherwise it may cause defeat. I fully agree with this statement and this essay will try to outline the benefits that school children can get by playing sports games. \n\nTo begin with, including team games in physical education classes will aid kids to cooperate together. To be more clear, pupils will immediately comprehend that playing individually may bring their team to loss and will understand the importance of playing together. Thus, this method is workable in terms of teaching how to work in a group. For instance, when I was in the 4th grade, it was weird for me and I could not work in pairs. Fortunately, this problem was tackled when I once participated in a team sports competition which was organized by the school. Morever,team sports also help to improve misunderstanding and reduce conflicts among students. Saying thoroughly, pupils often quarrel with each other without any serious reason and by playing like a team they can acquire skills in how to reduce the number of conflicts. Subsequently, they start to understand each other even at a glance. \n\nFrom my point of view, sport plays a crucial role for every child, and it is the best way to teach kids what collaboration is and how they can profit from that. \n\nTaking everything into account, squad games during physical education classes will definitely teach offsprings how to cooperate by working together with different people to reach a goal and learn how to solve conflicts.",

    "essay": "In todayâs educational landscape, many people are thinking about the impact of team sports at school for the children. While various methods exist, I strongly believe that this solution is the best way to cooperate teenagers between them. In this essay, I will discuss why I hold this view and provide two supporting reasons.\n\nTo begin with, company game provides self-discipline which teaches younger how to work collaboratively. It is one of the main keys for success, fostering crucial interpersonal skills. For instance, in a volleyball team, players must know and understand how to communicate with each other to provide their strategy for achieving goals. Consequently, the collaborative experience not only teaches infants the significant role of working together, but also helps them develop strong bonds with their teammates.\n\nSecondly, children are exposed to both success and failure together, which has an essential impact on collective responsibility. When a team succeeds, each member shares in the victory, reinforcing the idea that cooperation leads to mutual benefits. For example, in moments of failure, kids learn to support and uplift one another, understanding that overcoming challenges requires collective effort. As a result, this shared experience contributes significantly to character development and prepares them for future collaborative endeavors.\n\nIn conclusion, team sports at school stand out as the most effective method for teaching infants cooperation. The structured environment, coupled with exposure to success and failure as a team, imparts invaluable life skills. By engaging in team sports, teenagers learn to collaborate effectively and develop a sense of collective responsibility that will serve them well in their future endeavors.",

    "essay": "The idea that team sports at school are the best way to teach children to cooperate is widely supported. I strongly agree with this view, as team sports, such as basketball and futsal, require players to collaborate and suppress their egos.\n\nThrough team sports, students learn how to play for their team and improve their ability to understand other players. To win, players must cooperate with one another, and this is not possible if they do not trust each other. For example, in basketball, each player has a unique position and responsibility, and they must support each other to score. They cannot play for themselves if they want to beat their opponents. This approach teaches children to collaborate and work with others, skills that they can apply in other settings, such as schoolwork, work, and building their own business.\n\nAdditionally, team sports help to reduce children's tendency to focus solely on themselves, a characteristic that is common among young people. In team sports, they must abandon the idea of being the best and focus on the team's goal. For example, if the target is to win a futsal tournament, they must stick to their strategy, which every member of the team must follow. This approach fosters unity and helps children learn to cooperate effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, participating in sports that require more than one person to play is an effective way to build children's collaboration skills. They learn unconsciously how to work as part of a team and how to use their skills to support their teammates. Furthermore, playing team sports makes children happier because of the production of dopamine during the game, making them more receptive to learning cooperation skills.",

While some argue that creating a building specialised facilities is necessary for people, I claim that it would have a positive impact on the development of sports skills and keeping a healthy lifestyle for all dwellers. \n\nThere are two main reasons why allocating money to sports construction is a useful decision for all countries. One of them is that sports facilities would be affordable for everyone. Sometimes people can't allow buying a subscription to a gym or activity circle. It would be a great contribution to maintaining an active lifestyle. Another cogent reason is advancing some talents among the young generation. This phenomenon could prepare sportsmen for different kinds of  international competitions. For instance, according to the statistics of the Worldwide Sports Community the countries which support and promote sports buildings for citizens have special respect on a national rank. \n\nI personally believe that establishing specialised equipment is relatively positive for several reasons with the main one being that it extends longevity. In addition, the promotion and propaganda of sports objects can lead to plummeting in smoking and an addicted population. \n\nTo conclude, establishing and improving this kind of activity would lead to positive effects.

The thing that they probably don't aware of is that there is a likelihood to exist a toxic environment in a sports team. Besides bullying and the offensive nicknames, they will receive when they fail. Furthermore, they are the same age but don't have the same abilities.

On the other hand, the advantage of the sports team is variety, such as discipline and working under pressure and getting along with troubles.

Although doing team sports is one of the efficient ways to achieve that, I believe teachers can find better solutions than this method.\n\nOn the one hand, team sports demand students to work closely and communicate frequently, which will improve children's cooperative skills. During this process, they will realize that everyone is born with strengths and shortcomings and only by working together can they have a competitive edge in the future. Also, doing team sports brings students more happiness than individual sports and help them to make new friends, which may motivate them to cooperate with others in the future.\n\nOn the other hand, other methods, such as working in groups to solve a practical problem, are also efficient to boost students' collaborative spirit. For example, there are a wide variety of interdisciplinary programs in many schools, which need the contribution of team members that are good at different subjects. Without joint effort, children will never be able to come to a satisfying solution. As a result, they will realize how important it is to cooperate with and learn from each other.

Many people, all around the world, rely and believe everything they read, hear or watch on news media.

It makes people aware and conscious of the decisions made as well. In this manner, if prices go down on certain articles, people could choose to buy in advance and save for the future. \n\nNevertheless, there are some drawbacks to news-media influence. It makes people scared of going out on the streets by streaming only violent and sad news. When it only shows, for example, robberies and homicides instead of the increase in volunteer work or special musical events, it can make the audience lose perspective about reality. Another serious issue regarding the media is fake news. These can create misconceptions, wrong needs and increase violence between citizens.  For instance, a lie about the spread of a particular disease will make people buy, steal and fight for a bottle of sanitizing alcohol without an actual real need. \n\nIn conclusion, whereas being informed may feel essential to feel part of this globalized world, we should be cautious about what we see, hear or read.

In my opinion, this is  certainly not a sign of positive development as it could be nocive to  health.\n\nTo begin with, today, it has become common for lots of people to visit beauty salons in order to modify their external appearance in the way they want. This phenomenon emerged after certain celebrities on social media started posting  photos containing their much younger looks.

Indeed, surprised by this amazing transformation, millions of her followers started doing the same by spending thousands of dollars in beauty clinics. So, this is the reason why many want to alter their looks.\n\nSecondly, I believe that the negative side of this trend is the long-term side effects of treatments undergone in order to have better physical looks.

Consequently, he or she could even spoil his or her natural appearance if this disease becomes severe.

In my opinion, I disagree that education is the better one as it is rather impossible to compare these two methodsâ effectiveness owing to their distinct impacts.\n\nOn the one hand, the reasons why prisons are of indispensable necessity for social securityare varied. They are the place to keep people who have broken the law contained, ensuring the safety of other citizens. Especially, dangerous criminals such as murderers or rapists have to be imprisoned for their heinous actions. Furthermore, severe prison sentences act as a deterrent against crimes. Knowing there might be a chance of getting caught and condemned to jail, which also means losing freedom and living a miserable life in a cell, ones who are having the intention of committing illegalities would reconsider going down the path.\n\nOn the other hand, education serves as a remedy for the origin of crimes. Education contributes greatly to heighten peopleâs intellect and to form a civilized society. With access to better educational services, citizens would be well-informed about the damage that committing crimes would cause to their community and themselves, which eventually leads to the decline in crime rates. Additionally, the possession of certain qualifications through fundamental education like vocational training could secure a personâs stable life, which would dispel any ideas of committing crimes.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe there is no absolute way to deduce whether imprisonment policies or better education would take the dominant role in dealing with crimes as they both tackle the problem just in different ways.",

In terms of the committed crime, I totally agree that imprisonment would be the best way as a conviction, which is beneficial for self-reflection and social impact. \n\nProviding a plethora of prisons seems the most favourite preference for some countries in order to undermine devious criminals. This selection may be opted to protect communities from the offenders since they do not recognize if there is a villain in surrounding that will emerge the next crime possibility. Moreover, it looks helpful for the offender to do self-evaluation and behave in positive manners when they are settled inside, so they may realize their mistakes . To illustrate, in Indonesia, the persuasive methods is not efficient enough to decrease the number of criminals, so entering the offenders to jails is the main conviction if they are being accused. They will be arrested and investigated with the police officers and processed into prisons. Consequently, the criminal rate plummets significantly, and the societies feel safe and convenient to do activities outside. \n\nOn the other hand, applying education methods, such as mediation or rehabilitation does not support making the offenders feel guilty and give up doing the crime, even though some people still believe that this approach would be effective. Nonetheless, there is real evidence that it is not useful to combat the crime, Canada as an example. This country has the jeopardy gangster that will savage murder and cannot bargain with anyone, including the government officers. Thus, it is mandatory to do a harsh procedure to raid them and put them into jail.\n\nIn summary, I considered preferring imprisonment as the best way since it has several benefits of the aforementioned rather than using the persuasive method like education.",

In my idea, education has more benefit rather than other retributions. I will state the reasons for my view in this essay.\nThe most compelling reason for holding to my view is that prison sentence is useless to prevent criminals from reoffending. Firstly, no practical change would happen in their life as a prisoner. As committing crimes is a consequence of how people think and their mindset is, deep and real changes should be created in their thoughts to turn over a new leaf. It would not be achieved unless appropriate and adequate training schemes are considered. It can be really helpful for those who are enticed by others to become an offender. Moreover, committing crimes is not only because of lack of education, but also because of being jobless that may lead people to some offences: smuggling, mugging and theft to earn money. If people learn a skill, their chance for finding a job will be increased. So, teaching a skill can make offenders to find a job and possibility of reoffending would be lessened in this situation.\nAnother reason for my position is that being in a jail has some drawbacks as well as physical and mental hurts and should be altered by another punishment such as education. Despite all protecting measures, many diseases and injuries can be observed in jails. Sometimes, health condition is not acceptable in prisons. Nor can a wide variety of viruses and bacteria exist there. In addition, it is common in jails that criminals fall out with each other. So, some of them will be hurt. On the other hand, becoming homesick, depressed and disappointed is one of the hazards that can threaten prisoners mentally.\nIn conclusion, prison sentence has some demerits that are really significant.

It is the responsibility of parents to notice what their children are interested in and give them an opportunity to go to extra lessons or sections with certain directions that would satisfy their enjoyment.

In addition, with exception of sports, society needs individuals with diverse talents and skills to stay society to be in harmony.\n\nTo conclude, I fully support this case of dissimilar motives of youngsters, since humanity requires different categories of communities.",

    "essay": "These days, general well-being has become a public concern. It is believed by many that authorities are entitled to issue food-regulating rules in order to ameliorate public health. However, others discern that individuals are responsible for their choices, and they do not have to be obliged to consume certain types of diet. Whilst I firmly believe that governments ought to intervene to a certain extent, I also believe that citizens have to be at liberty to choose from different options according to their health conditions and appearance preferences.\n\nOn the one hand, one reason why states should intervene in civilians' food choices relates to their power of supervision over various health-influencing sectors. In other words, some food corporations tend to mislead consumers by providing them with illusive images regarding their products as being healthy while they are loaded with palm oils and refined sugars. Since states are able to censor such erroneous data, they would be adjusting citizens' options by discarding such produce. One further reason why governments ought to participate in the selection process is that they are armed with nutrition experts and researchers who are able to provide citizens with the proper and up-to-date options according to universal health organisations and the latest recommendations around the world. In Egypt, for instance, public education campaigns against the dangers of obesity have been launched which have been based on the latest findings of WHO regarding  food choices.\n\nOn the other hand, one evident merit which proves the necessity of personal choices without governmental intervention relates to medical reasons. In other words, in certain medical conditions, regularly do patients require a specific style of diet in order to override the complications of such an ailment. Patients , therefore, have to adjust their intake and opt for suitable choices, the thing that cannot be actualized by governmental intervention. An eminent example of this is diabetic patients who are obliged to cut sugar and carbohydrate intake as their bodies are not able to eliminate simple sugars from their bodies. From a physical perspective,  civilians should be given the right to choose their preferable body shape. This is mainly due to the fact that what an individual is keen to consume usually reflects back on their appearance and physique. Bodybuilders, for instance, who choose to have such an iconic body image opt for a high-protein diet which helps them augment their solid muscles. Subsequently, any roles may be considered to be a violation of their rights of having a particular body appearance. \n\nIn conclusion, despite the previously-mentioned benefits of authoritarian intervention on food options, I am convinced that individuals should be given the choice to adjust their intake for health and preference reasons.",

    "essay": "Health of the society has become an important problem in recent years. It is argue by some that nutrition and food policies should be created by authorties of countries in order to enhance individuals' health, as others asserts that it is belong to people's option. Taking some roles of governments in terms of creating food laws may be beneficial for people. Looking from the other side of this issue, it depends to people's responsibility.\n\nOn one the hand, it gives positive effects to people that governments create some policies in favor of nutrion. Most people have less information about foods and their ingredients hence, they may do some faults in terms of food selection. Governments can guide people to choose beneficial foods for human's health by some regulations. They may also enforce food manufacturers and agricultural businesses to present healthy foods and goods for people by laws and inspections. Thus, people's nutrion and health quality can develop.\n\nOn the other hand, people have to possess the responsibility of food preference. By the technologic improvements, people have taken a chance to get information easier than past. They can explore about food's contents if they want to inform from many sources.  In addition, many programmes and conferences have been arranged to raise awareness in terms of variety of foods. Therefore, people can figure out their issues about nutrion without any support.\n\nIn conclusion, causes and examples can be multiplied about this discussion. Although, people have been qualified with improvements to sustain their health about nutrition, in my opinion, it would get more benefits that governemnts may intervene by some regulations and laws.",

    "essay": "Some people believe that the government can make laws regarding nutritious food in order to improve public health, while others say that a person has the responsibility for his own health. Although the state can make strict laws about the selling of nutritious food items, this essay believes that people can alter their lifestyles to become healthy.\n\nOn the one hand, there are those who think that the authorities can impose strict guidelines on food companies in order to enhance public health. This is because if some food companies and restaurants are not providing food up to the governmentâs standard, then strict action should be taken against those. For instance, it has been found in a recent survey by The Sunday Times that peoplesâ health can significantly be improved when the government imposes strict laws on food companies about the nutritious value of their food items. However, I disagree with this viewpoint because of the following reason.\n\nOn the other hand, it is thought that men and women can improve their health standards on their own. This is because they can include more fruits and vegetables in their daily diet and can do some physical activities by making small changes in their daily routine. For example, I was a fatty person and used to eat junk food daily. But when I started doing exercise and eating healthy food by making changes in my lifestyle, I have become a healthy person. Therefore, I believe that someoneâs health depends on their own by altering their lifestyle.\n\nIn conclusion, although the government can make laws to boost public health, I believe that it is a personâs responsibility to become healthy by changing the way of living their life.",

    "essay": "Many people believe that government should regulate nutrition to improve public wellness, while others suppose that not only can individuals choose their food but can also be responsible for this one. The following paragraphs will shed some light on this debate before drawing a logical conclusion.\n\nOn the one hand, Government plays an important role in controling food hygiene and the use of chemicals, preservatives and adhesives in food items. Using unauthorised chemicals, selling low-quality food could be forbidden by government and only the government can ensure the quality of food which can protect their citizens from suffering dangerous diseases. For example, expired, low âquality or fake food can be supervised and banned because no matter how proper is diet someone may have , unhealthy food will affect their well- being.\n\nOn the other hand, Also, individualâs selection and responsibility for food are of great importance for their healthy lifestyle. First, If an individual does not follow the healthy eating habit, no one can help them to improve their health, not even the government. On top of that, Constraining dietary alternatives, even if it is done with the best result, could consequently generate disappointment among the population, which would possibly lead to other public issues such as protests and demonstrations. That is the reason why the decisions of individuals greatly pursue overall health condition of a nation.\n\nIn conclusion, Despite the benefits of government in controlling nutrious food, in my view, there are good grounds for rejecting the idea that people should not have their personal choice and be responsible in the matter of food. The combination of these ideas would greatly promote the public health.",

    "essay": "Some people think that the main purpose of school is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\n \n\nSome individuals argue that the major intention of schools is to make off springs into good citizens and laborers while others claim that it is beneficial for children. In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement, and my reason will be elaborated on in the forthcoming paragraphs.\n\n \n\nTo begin with, most of the subjects that are taught in schools aim to teach us how to be appropriate national for the government.  Moreover, sometimes these courses are not really advantages for pupils since they are not really interested in that subject, However, they should pass these lessons which will teach them about acting politely, which leads to kind and respectful folks. As an example, social studies will aim to help us become well-behaved residents of society in the future.\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, the duration of time that juveniles spend attending school is equivalent to the work hours of worker individuals. Indeed, they both spend most of their golden time putting effort into tasks that they are disinterested in and at the end of the day, they are just too exhausted to find their actual talent. For instance, in some nations, some jobs are not considered as real careers such as being an artist and at times, families do not allow their child to follow their dreams and force them to be an ordinary human with a normal life and work from 9 to 5 like other human beings.\n\n \n\nIn conclusion, schools may play a significant role in pupilsâ life, however, most people believes that, their focus on nurturing good kids for the future system\n\nand also, helpful workers in their place of work.

It is true that education means a lot to folk in our contemporary world. Today, the growing demand for education due to globalization emphasizes its importance. This issue education is important for some nations, not important for others, it is left to their own personal opinions. The problem of our modern civilization is still those who think negatively about education.\n\nOn the one hand, education it's good for children and humanity. Moreover, as some argue, the thoughts of people living in remote parts of the world prove that education is not important. One of the main reasons for this is, for example, a different way of thinking and a different outlook. If the labour capacity of  humanity increases, the development potential will also increase\n\nOn the other hand, I agree that we have several options in terms of alternatives because I believe that education is not only interesting for me but for everyone. A short experience shows that if we study about education, we should shed light on the path of adults and children with what we learn.\n\nIn conclusion, it is confirmed once again that education is a useful alternative for the development of the nation.

    "essay": "People have different views about the main purpose of schools. While some people believe that schools should focus on professional skills, I believe that helping children to become a person is more important.\n\nOn the one hand, schoolsâ aim should be to prepare children to become successful future employees. children need to gain educational qualifications to pursue a career that has a high salary and insurance. In this way, they can buy their own houses and cars and start a family. For example, in the US, an increase in living costs shows that people need to earn large amounts of money so that they can have a good quality of life. thus, those who have great school grades may have more chances to enrol in university degrees and could face better job opportunities with higher wages.\n\nOn the other hand, despite the arguments described above, schools have a significant role to help children to create their personalities and to contribute positively to society. To begin with, they teach students some beneficial behaviour such as sharing, tolerance, and discipline. Moreover, they would learn about their responsibilities towards the environment and how to protect natural habitats. Furthermore, educating pupils could involve moral values like showing respect to different cultures and religions. For example, in the UK, secondary schools have some extended programs related to discussing the standards of peopleâs behaviour in society with students.\n\nIn conclusion, while I accept that schools should make children ready for their working life, I think their responsibility to provide social skills for students is undeniable.",

    "essay": "Many are of the opinion that the primary role of schools is to create good citizens, instead of simply working towards individual betterment. In my opinion, schools should aim to elevate the individual, not impose conformity.\n\nThose in favour of this statement argue the value of a well-functioning society. As the world develops and there are advances in medicine, safety, working conditions, and so on it is easy to forget that this level of comfort requires sacrifices for the common good. Individuals must work at companies to stimulate the economy and the public must have a basic sense of community in order to live peaceably with oneâs neighbours. School is where this education can begin. Teachers can explicitly and implicitly guide students to socially beneficial behaviours and educate them well enough to establish a viable future career.\n\nHowever, I would argue that focusing on the individual will accomplish the goals detailed above but also be mentally healthier. Students who are taught to share, work well in teams, and develop their talents will contribute to society as a byproduct of pursuing their own seemingly selfish interests. Moreover, there may be times when the focus on society will come at the cost of the mental health of individuals. For instance, students who are taught to withhold their personal viewpoints in school, as is common in many authoritarian nations, may harbour resentment and not feel they can fully express themselves in a free environment. Psychological research has shown that the key to healthy growth is feeling safe to express oneself without fear of reprisals and repercussions.\n\nIn conclusion, although there is a valid argument in favour of social stability, schools should aim to produce healthy, industrious individuals. Naturally, these goals are not mutually exclusive and the overlap should be emphasized.",

    "essay": "It is a fact that some celebrities become more popular for their luxurious lifestyles and possessions these days rather than for their mesmerising accomplishments. To a certain extent, this kind of popularity tends to lead young people in the wrong direction. However, there are also some celebrities who got to the place that they are at the moment for their actions and accomplishments.\n\nOn the one hand, some celebrities pursued easy ways to get famous such as getting married to a popular or rich person, living a fancy, shopaholic lifestyle or even doing unbelievable things and streaming live sessions. Moreover, it has become easier as social media platforms such as TikTok and instagram turned into a spotlight especially for those kinds of people. For  instance, the Kardasian family members are now billionaires with all the money gained from their reality show and hot topics of Hollywood despite the fact that not even one of them has a talent such as acting, singing or doing sports. Additionally, a group of TikTokers named Hype House is such a hit and on the tip of the tongue of every teenager these days but what they are doing are inappropriate performances, dances, partying and even breaking rules and restrictions during the pandemic. Such kinds of influences only aim to gain publicity and send a wrong message to the youngsters that successful life means wealth and accessories and it does not have to be meaningful.\n\nOn the contrary, it is great to have such kinds of famous people who live with compassion and put their great efforts to gain success in life. From their perspective, a way to success is a combination of passion, hard work and strong determination. Those are the people who apply themselves in developing their skills and abilities through perseverance. As an example, a korean boy band named BTS is nowadays among the most famous celebrities in this 21st century. They came all the way from South Korea and broke amazing records one by one in a way that no South Koreans have ever done before. All the members came from rural areas of their country to Seoul and worked so hard even before their debut.

Due to their hard work, now, theyâve set a great example and become idols to young people all over the world and made those youngsters believe in themselves and their worth.\n\nIn conclusion, it is true that as various types of social media platforms are being accessible these days, children are likely to be influenced by the so-called celebrities. Anyway, there are still some famous people who can make young people believe that their dreams could come true with hard work and passion. Thus, in my opinion, I think it is best if young people become more selective with choosing their role models.",

    "essay": "Due to a lack of houses in cosmopolitan cities, several people opine that this trend could call tremendous impacts on society and assist that the government can only take some actions. In this essay, I will discuss my support for the agree view. \n\nFirst of all, the government is the only way to fix this problem since it has taxes to build more house. It is well known that it causes a lot of expenses in order to build a plethora of houses. Citizens donât have enough financial income to build a house. If the government builds houses by tax, they can lower the number of people who does not have a house and receive money when citizens purchase homes. For instance, my house in South Korea, which is located in a heart of city, is built by the government as our area had a lack of residential houses. Due to the government action, our place has enough place to reside now. All in all, due to money, only the government can solve this issue. \n\nFurthermore, the government have a power to held a campaign to make citizens transfer to rural areas to live. In order to lower the percentage of the shortage of housing, the government can distribute money for those who relocate their place in countryside. If a lot of citizens move their place to suburb areas, there will be many house that is vacant. For example, South Korea recently gave money to the people who transferred their house to rural place. After this campaign, there was a abrupt increase in the rate of people who started to reside in a countryside. Furthermore, youngsters also started to relocate in suburban areas and seek a job there. To sum up it is clear that a campaign can be held to fix this issue, which only the government can do.\n\nIn conclusion, the government is the only hope for the metropolitan cities to solve their issues about decreasing amount of a number of houses in cities where people can live since it has money and power.",

    "essay": "There has been much discussion revolving around the issue of whether students should  focus on further education in universities and colleges or it is better to let them apply for a  job straight after school. In this essay I am going to present both views and give my opinion.  Some people tend to think that it is better to continue your education in higher institutions,  because of the higher employment opportunities. One of the first things we need to take into  consideration is that universities and colleges give you more understanding and knowledge  in the sphere you are studying in, that helps you become a better specialist and most of the  employers search for well trained workers. For example, nurses and dentists are required to  have special training, which can take for about ten years, without it they wonât even be able  to become a simple doctor. But not only students of medical specialisations take further education, designers, managers, writers and others do it too, thatâs because often students  donât have enough knowledge to start their career, but with the help of professors, they have  a lot more chances to become professionals and it will be easier for them to get a job.  However, others insist that itâs better to get a job, because you can earn money and not  spend it on expensive learning. For instance, university prices go higher every year which is  not affordable for every family to let their children apply for one, so as we can see from the  last trends, it becomes more common for students to start their own business, build career  as a photographer, freelancer or etc. and make good money out of it.  To conclude, I consider learning at high education institutions is a good base for future  career and improvement students will get is indispensable, but in my opinion it is not a  necessity and it would be nicer to put less pressure on those, who have chosen not to take  this path and got a job straight after school.",

    "essay": "Nowadays, the governments and public developers have been working hard to determine the mix charity allocation among all citizens  around the world. Although some individuals believe that the citizens in the country are the ones who need the most help from their governments, however others, including me, believe that the governments still cannot ignore people from the rest of the world.\n\nOn the one hand, there are two main reasons why all types of assistances of the government must go towards own residents. Firstly, since the financial matter is essential for charities, financial management could be more effective by giving aid to domestic citizens who are having difficulties in their lives. In fact, not all charitable organizations have massive scale and abundant source of finance, therefore they cannot take care of both the poor people in their country and others being out of their national border at the same time. Secondly, it may be a pragmatic strategy for charity funds when they focus on providing aid to their residents because it allows their country to be less reliant on foreign subsidies in case of emergency. For example, there would be a beneficial effect on some countries which often suffer from natural disasters, such as Vietnamese, Philippine, Japan, etc. If their charities afford to rescue local people instead of expecting outside support.\n\nOn the other hand, it has been true in many cases that the prolonged poverty cannot be solved without the assistance from foreign humanitarian organizations. First, the product of poverty is the hunger, causing millions of deaths all around the world every year. As a result, if outside governments have steps for finance towards residents, who have been living in other countries,  which would save the lives of humans. Second, governmental organizations can help provide the education and skill for those citizens. As a result, plenty of evidence suggests that the most effective way to overcome poverty is education.\n\nIn conclusion, although some think that domination systems must only support the poor dwellers, but I think other nations should receive assistance because of above-mentioned reasons, and this method can reduce the financial pressure of international organisations.",

Therefore most media companies prefer to show news which has little or no connection with people`s lives. For example, suicides and political dramas. Sadly, most people are interested to know such news simply to gossip with another or to kill their time, despite such news won`t bring any good for them. \n\nSecondly, media companies are reluctant to show good things happening around the world because they feel such news will make their customers bored. Therefore they prefer not to show them even if such news could help people to improve themselves. \n\n  A recent survey done at Melbourne University  found  that 80% of the news is either sad or depressing which clearly indicates that reading articles or watching programs is just a waste of time. \n\nIn summary, all the media companies are money oriented and because of ,that they tend to show what excites the people even if that news has no value whatsoever. I strongly agree that news has no connection with the population`s lives and it is just another way for  people to kill their time.",

    "essay": "Today, technology is developing rapidly and so are we and so are mediums of information. Nowadays, if any, things happen in any part of the world, the news reaches us. The question arises here whether the news we receive is reliable or not? Because of this many people think the news has no evident connection with people life so reading news from a newspaper or watching it on television is a waste of time. Watching or reading news has its own pros and cons in my opinion.\n\nIn todays world we need to stay updated all the time. News plays an important role in keeping us posted about the day to day events. Watching or reading news can provide around the globe information and it is the biggest  exposure one can get. Nevertheless, This can only be possible when information is coming from a trusted source.\n\nAs the number of sources of information grows, sources of fake information also grows and no information is way better than fake information. Due to the rise of fake information people are now not interested in knowing the news because it has nothing to do with people's life.\n \nIn conclusion, news is extremely important part of our lives and we need to follow the news, but the news needs to come from a reliable source a source which is authentic in nature. For that government and news channels has to take responsibility to show authentic and genuine news, otherwise serious action will be taken against them.",

    "prompt": "Many customs and traditional ways of behaviors are no longer relevant to the modern life and no worth keeping. Do you agree or disagree?",
    "essay": "Human society has evolved substantially over the last centuries, and with such considerable changes come opinions that the old way of living has lost its relevancy and should be terminated. I cannot entirely agree as many traditions remain their acute importance in shaping generationâs behaviors and community. \n\nThere are numerous conservative etiquette and concepts that appear unworthwhile to follow in the modern era. As the world is changing quickly, modern lifestyles differ significantly from the conventional ways of living. Therefore, the young generation with their forward-thinking ways should diminish those traditional cultures and even explore new cultural norms instead. The tradition of valuing men above women, for example, conflicts with feminism today. Those conventional concepts, furthermore, defer individuals from pursuing their freedom, in contrast to the centric lifestyle of young people. Gender stereotypes such as the belief of women's bias in housework, thereby preventing them from chasing their dreams is a salient instance of this. Accordingly, the young should have the freedom not to follow outdated customs and establish practices that are more appropriate for their time. \n\n. \n\nHowever, continuing to uphold social norms contributes to cultural preservation and civilized society. In simple words, if young people follow social traditions in activities that are different between cultures, they would probably preserve the uniqueness of their heritage. It means that those practices give rise to cultural conservation. Adhering to social traditions, furthermore, could educate younger people to have appropriate manners and morals. Traditionally minded Vietnamese parents, for instance, instill in their children the value of bowing to their seniors, displaying their deep respect and appreciation. Therefore, teens are raised to be reliable and generous, creating a quality society with mannerism.\n\nIn conclusion, although the young should be selective in choosing the social traditions because of out-of-date conceptions, upholding customs and traditions aids in conserving national heritage and educating civilized residents for society.",

    "essay": "It is clear that development in technology is playing a major role in delivering education today. There is a view that by the end of year 2050, the typical presence of teacher and students in classroom will cease to exist. However, In my opinion, I agree with mentioned statement to certain extent as their will still be certain scenarios that shall remain as it is.\n\nFirstly, the pace with which education infrastructure is growing and adapting, it can be established that societies are accepting the virtual education platform. For instance, over the duration of past decade, fifty percent of the total academic degree's are now being offered online and by the end of next decade, it will be one-hundred percent. Recent technological advancements, such as virtual laboratories, assessments through artifical intelligence, certification exams being proctored using web-cam has left presence of individuals in classroom redundant. Evidently, with all the news ways of teaching, the typical presence of the students and a teacher in school classes is questionable.\n\nHowever, I believe certain scenarious between teachers and students are most-likely to remain unchanged for possibly the next three-decades. As an example, childrens will still be asked for regular home-work, assignment submission and regular examination. Failing to which, they could face same consequences. Furthermore, the most obvious problem of childrens being unattentive in classes and facing punishment would stay unchanged, even if the lectures are delivered virtually. Although there might be changes in the way childrens are punished so as to motivate them to study, but that shall not hinder the regular arguments between them.\n\nTo recapitulate, with the advancement of technology and changing behaviour of education delivery by 2050, In my opinion, certain, traditional scenarios between teachers and pupil, such as arguments, and punishments shall stay unchanged.",

    "prompt": "People nowadays tend to have children in older ages. do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?",
    "essay": "The grown-ups nowadays have this decision as parents to get kids in their middle ages. There are numerous advantages and disadvantages to have kids in older ages which will be discussed on the following paragraphs. As far as I am concerned the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. The paramount benefit of this choice is having less difficulty feelings in parents. As a proof, you can refer to all young mothers and fathers around you. Most of them feel tiredness and they always think they lost something about their youth. Regrettably, they are not wrong. For an example, imagine a young mommy and daddy who have an adventurous life with lot of hobbies and entertainments before they become a mother and a father. Now they should get their mama and papa roles and skip some of their fun times. In addition to that, the next profit of this chosen option is about the life experience. As life goes on, you become more experienced. You have more involvements with different issues and as a result you learn a lot from them. So according to that process, an older person may be a better mom and dad in wisdom aspects because she or he has more maturity than a younger person. On the other hand, we might see some cons in that situation. Age difference problems are not the things that you can ignore. Too much age differences can cause a lot of conflicts in a family and the most important one is the elders are not able to understand the youngers needs and thoughts. For instance, I invite you to depict a family who the mom and dad are in the age of 50 and the children are about 15. How a 50-year-old man can understand a teenager needs? It is mostly impossible. To sum up, beside that the decision of the good age for having children depends on the owner, it has acceptable benefits to have kids in old ages. You are suitably mature and you have enough knowledge to raise and educate a child by yourself.",

    "prompt": "People nowadays tend to have children at older ages.\n\nDo the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages.",
    "essay": "The question about the perfect time to have children is debatable. In recent times, the trend of having children has increased significantly. This essay will discuss both the positive and negative outcomes of having children at older ages, while also explaining why the advantages tend to outweigh any perceived downsides .\n\nTo begin with, one of the main benefits is stability and maturity. Many individuals often lack sufficient time for their children at a young age due to career commitments and an unstable income. After having a great career, they can easily afford the best and the stable life for their child. According to a recent survey at Cambridge University, in developed countries, 80% of respondents plan to have children after the age of 35 years old. Furthermore, more mature parents tend to possess financial stability and independence. This stability can create an environment where children's needs are consistently met, improving their overall upbringing.\n\nOn the other hand, it is essential to emphasize potential disadvantages. To commence with, complications during pregnancy can be increased by advanced maternal and paternal age, such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, and genetic disorders. In addition, older parents might have concerns about being able to provide for their children throughout their lives, especially if health issues arise later on.\n\n Also, the generation gap between older parents and their children might cause communication problems and difficulties in relating to each otherâs experiences.\n\nIn conclusion, despite several downsides, this trend should be welcomed and encouraged. Older parents might have more time to spend with their children, but the quality of that time might be influenced by physical limitations or generational differences.",
